00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,558
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made" --  

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,127
            matches.            

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,966
        carousel horses.        

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,838
         fine porcelain.        

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,445
   and automobile fuel tanks.   

8
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,720
   lighting a controlled fire   
      was not always easy.      

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:00,059
 only 200 years ago, you'd rub a
 rock on steel to create sparks.

10
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,127
  then a stunning discovery --  

11
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,863
that combining certain chemicals
        can ignite fire.        

12
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,332
         it wasn't long         
  before matches were invented, 

13
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,868
     putting these chemicals    
     on handy little sticks.    

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,137
          well, nothing         
       quite matches that.      

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,347
  the first matches left behind 
       a nauseating odor.       

16
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,949
    but today, they're safer,   

17
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,484
    and the smell dissipates    
           in seconds.          

18
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,953
      to make matchsticks,      

19
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,422
       this company starts      
    with recycled paperboard,   

20
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,424
      which is inexpensive      

21
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,161
 and thick enough to support the
 weight of chemicals on one end.

22
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:40,966
 a stamping press partially cuts
   the paper, creating stems.   

23
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,705
     as we see in this view     
    from inside the machine,    

24
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,908
   a die first cuts the stems.  

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,911
     and then a blade slices    
  through the sheet widthwise,  

26
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,714
making strips of 120 stems each.

27
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,527
        at actual speed,        
      it's all just a blur,     

28
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,997
       as the press makes       
  nearly 500 strips per minute. 

29
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,468
        next, the strips        
 move through a bath of hot wax.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,273
    it soaks into the stems     
    about 1/3 of the way up.    

31
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,143
    then they dry in an oven    
         for 15 seconds.        

32
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,677
     when you light a match,    

33
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,546
       the wax slows down       
the burn speed of the chemicals,

34
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,283
      sustaining the flame      
    for four or five seconds.   

35
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,287
         those chemicals        
   are gelatin and silicone --  

36
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,356
      to bind the chemicals     
         to the stick...        

37
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,828
 potassium chlorate -- an animal
  protein glue for oxidation... 

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,398
    sulfur to fuel the flame,   
        and two fillers.        

39
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,039
       they mix 700 pounds      
        of the chemicals        

40
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,042
 in a large vat with hot water. 

41
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,311
         this is enough         
   to make the chemical batter  

42
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:03,048
   for 25 million match heads.  

43
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,323
 a conveyor runs the matchsticks
       through the batter       

44
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,325
       to coat their tips.      

45
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,328
 three rollers in the tank raise
   the surface of the batter.   

46
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,797
      the first two ensure      
 the front and back of the heads

47
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,132
          get covered.          

48
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,533
    the third rotates faster    

49
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,770
     to remove excess batter    
  as the heads leave the tank.  

50
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,542
   from there, the matchsticks  
   travel about a quarter mile  

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,878
    while fans air-dry them.    

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,547
     the factory temperature    

53
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,815
        is a comfortable        
     72 degrees fahrenheit,     

54
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,285
      just what's required      
    for the chemicals to dry    

55
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,221
           and harden.          

56
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,890
    these minerals are silica   
       and red phosphorus.      

57
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,027
  add a little glue, and you've 
  got what's called friction -- 

58
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,296
    the material in the strip   
    you rub the match against   

59
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,433
    to make the head ignite.    

60
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,769
  to make these striker strips, 
       as they're called,       

61
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,638
          a steel wheel         
    rolls friction onto paper   

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,575
          that's moving         
    through a cutting press.    

63
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,911
 this isn't the same paper from 
which they make the matchsticks.

64
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,114
      it's a higher-quality     
       non-recycled paper,      

65
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,116
  suitable for color graphics,  

66
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,119
   because many clients order   
custom-printed matchbook covers.

67
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,059
another press with rotary blades
    slices through the paper,   

68
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,129
        creating segments       
    that are 4.2 inches long.   

69
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,799
        that's the length       
    of an unfolded matchbook.   

70
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,743
  now back to the matchsticks.  

71
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,079
  a worker arranges the strips  
       into layers of two.      

72
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,214
  the conveyor then feeds them  
         into a machine         

73
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,417
      that will attach them     
    to the matchbook covers.    

74
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,754
      the machine performs      
         several tasks.         

75
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:52,824
  it cuts the matchstick strips 
  into rows of 10 matches each. 

76
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,896
and it cuts the matchbook covers

77
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,166
      to their final width      
         of 1.5 inches.         

78
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:13,178
 the machine folds the matchbook
      covers over two rows,     

79
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,446
         or 20 matches,         

80
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:18,950
 then inserts one strong staple 
    through all four layers.    

81
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,590
     next, a conveyor moves     
    the assembled matchbooks    

82
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,592
       to another machine       
        that counts them        

83
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:32,564
  and creates two side-by-side  
  rows of 25 ready for boxing.  

84
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,603
          this company          
      also makes its boxes      

85
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,538
   out of recycled paperboard.  

86
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,275
  each one holds 50 matchbooks  
  and sells for about a buck.   

87
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,744
         that's a dollar        
       for 1,000 matches,       

88
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,681
 or just a penny for 10 matches.

89
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,957
            narrator:           
         centuries ago,         

90
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,093
         soldiers tested        
      their cavalry skills      

91
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,495
         astride the rim        
  of a large horizontal wheel.  

92
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,832
  eventually, europe's wealthy  
 elite saw this as entertainment

93
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,702
    and turned the practice     
    into a fabulous pageant.    

94
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,905
     nowadays, you can ride     
  a whole menagerie of animals. 

95
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,242
  but the star of the carousel  
       is still the horse.      

96
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,383
   their life revolves around   
          a fairground,         

97
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,019
 but they're born here on paper.

98
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,126
   a craftsman draws a pattern  
   of the horse's silhouette,   

99
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:38,096
    then fills it in with the   
 saddle, straps, and a harness. 

100
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,065
     some models may include    
            a shield,           

101
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,534
        a coat of arms,         
        or even flowers.        

102
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,540
  another craftsman then glues  
  together blocks of linden --  

103
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,876
     wood that's lightweight    
       and easy to carve.       

104
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,146
he stacks four of them to create
   what's called an end block.  

105
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,683
 it'll form part of the horse's 
 body, what's known as the core.

106
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,024
  he clamps the blocks together 
        to compress them        

107
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,828
      and lets the glue set     
         for 45 minutes.        

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,230
   the finished core includes   
         two end blocks         

109
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,033
   sandwiched by top, bottom,   
        and side panels,        

110
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,969
      plus one wooden piece     
  they'll carve into a saddle.  

111
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,238
     the middle of the core     
           is hollow.           

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,174
  on a carousel with 50 horses, 

113
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,444
  this trims the overall weight 
      by up to three tons.      

114
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,117
     after covering the core    
       with carbon paper,       

115
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,389
          the craftsman         
    lays the pattern on top.    

116
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,059
  he traces the pattern with a  
leadless pencil called a stylus.

117
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,794
   the carbon paper underneath  

118
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,931
      transfers the drawing     
         onto the wood.         

119
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,532
    he'll follow these lines    

120
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,334
   to cut out the basic shape   
          of the horse.         

121
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,572
    later, they'll carve most   
  of the finer details by hand. 

122
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:07,552
 using a band saw, he slices the
 core carefully along the lines.

123
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,362
     next, he drills a hole     
          for the pole          

124
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,634
     that attaches the horse    
        to the carousel.        

125
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,503
  here, a craftsman uses what's 
   called a carving duplicator  

126
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,105
       to create the head.      

127
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,973
      following a template,     

128
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,043
   the machine sculpts a block  
 of wood into the horse's head, 

129
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:36,181
     a painstaking process      
     that takes 90 minutes.     

130
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:40,518
    the duplicator can carve    
    up to four heads at once.   

131
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,187
    it also adjusts to carve    
       some finer details       

132
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,624
     into the larger pieces,    
        such as the core.       

133
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,597
    they use something called   
         a parting tool         

134
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,533
 to shape the decorative tassels
         on the bridle.         

135
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,602
 this one has a fanciful design,

136
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,006
      what an arabian horse     
      would typically wear.     

137
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,743
the craftsman has a huge arsenal
    of tools at his disposal    

138
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,345
      to create all kinds       
      of special features,      

139
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,814
       such as a flowing,       
         windblown mane.        

140
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,819
      the tools are sharp,      
   and they're precise enough   

141
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,288
      to sculpt even tiny,      
         intricate parts        

142
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,958
      such as eye sockets,      
      nostrils, and teeth.      

143
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,967
    after applying polyester    
         adhesive putty         

144
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,170
       in the eye sockets,      
     he adds two glass eyes.    

145
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,240
   unlike real horses' pupils,  
    which are oval in shape,    

146
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:40,177
     these have round pupils    
     for a friendlier look.     

147
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,715
   a carousel horse is roughly  
half the height of a real horse,

148
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:48,386
    but the size of its feet    
        is true to life,        

149
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,656
       so workers nail on       
   authentic iron horseshoes.   

150
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,858
          these prevent         
     the wood from chipping     

151
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,529
    under the feet of riders    
  who get rowdy in the saddle.  

152
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:01,266
 wooden pegs temporarily connect
 the head and tail to the body. 

153
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,601
       once workers verify      
         the alignment,         

154
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:08,540
    they'll glue the sections   
            together.           

155
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,012
 after sanding down the entire  
 surface, the paint job begins. 

156
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,482
             first,             
  three coats of white primer.  

157
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,350
         this highlights        
        any imperfections       

158
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,419
       the sanding missed.      

159
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,159
        once that's done,       
       the artwork begins.      

160
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,229
 this horse will wear a bright, 
      multicolored harness.     

161
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,970
  its coat will be in different 
    shades of the same color    

162
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,504
      for a realistic look.     

163
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,641
    it takes up to five coats   
 of paint to get it just right. 

164
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,310
  up to seven coats of varnish  

165
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,446
       will keep the horse      
 looking beautiful for decades. 

166
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,849
         after a lengthy        
       production process       

167
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,517
  that takes about two months,  

168
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,421
    these striking creatures    
  are ready for the fairground. 

169
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,464
            narrator:           
 porcelain is often called china

170
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,667
 after the country that invented
  it more than 1,200 years ago. 

171
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,136
        it looks delicate       

172
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,139
but is actually the hardest type
      of ceramic material.      

173
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,607
         it's even used         
    in electrical insulators    

174
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,010
      because it withstands     
         very high heat.        

175
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,213
      but most people think     
   of porcelain as decorative.  

176
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:30,088
       this company makes       
  40 different porcelain items. 

177
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,623
   it all starts with a sketch  
         of the piece --        

178
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,493
     in this case, a teapot.    

179
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,295
           after that,          
  a master mold of the piece -- 

180
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,365
   a negative made of plaster.  

181
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,867
        craftsmen use it        
   to make a production mold.   

182
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,776
  porcelain begins as powder,   
  a blend of three minerals --  

183
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,845
  quartz, kaolin, and feldspar. 

184
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,114
 the workshop mixes this powder 
           with water           

185
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,919
to make a wet paste called slip.

186
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,454
          a craftswoman         
    fills the mold with slip.   

187
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,123
    within 10 minutes or so,    

188
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,592
       the porous plaster       
       absorbs the water,       

189
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,994
         leaving a crust        
        of hardened slip.       

190
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,796
   after pouring the rest out,  

191
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,733
she waits another 30 minutes for
the crust to continue hardening.

192
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,270
then she peels away the mold and
gets a first look at her teapot.

193
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,078
 here, she removes excess crust 
      from a different mold     

194
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
         for the spout.         

195
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,215
   she waits about 10 minutes,  

196
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,350
         until the spout        
    is hard enough to handle    

197
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:37,755
but still soft enough to sculpt.

198
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,960
with a utility knife, she carves
   open the end of the spout.   

199
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,103
       with a little water      
          and a sponge,         

200
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,373
   she smoothes out the edges   
       and curves the rim.      

201
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:08,453
  next, she extracts the handle 
       from a third mold.       

202
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,390
    then she pierces 12 holes   
 in the spout side of the teapot

203
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,726
  to filter out the tea leaves  
         when you pour.         

204
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,430
   she brushes on some slip to  
attach the spout and the handle.

205
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,136
     this model has a wedge     
        along the collar        

206
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,405
    to help align the handle    
           correctly.           

207
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,375
          other designs         
   have small notches instead.  

208
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,950
    she brushes on more slip    
 to ensure the parts will bond, 

209
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:44,155
  then sponges the surrounding  
surface to smooth out the drips.

210
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,524
      after the piece dries     
       for two more days,       

211
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,760
 she carves away the lines along
 the handle and under the spout 

212
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:55,300
     and sands down the rim.    

213
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,036
  they make some pieces using   
  a pressure-casting system --  

214
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,771
    the mold's made of resin    

215
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,774
    and tiny polyester beads    
       that create pores,       

216
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,176
     which absorb the water     
          in the slip.          

217
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,512
     after a hydraulic press    
        closes the mold,        

218
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,082
    the machine injects slip    
        into the cavity.        

219
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,452
        12 minutes later,       
a craftsman uses a suction plate

220
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,789
   to remove what will become   
       a serving platter.       

221
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,991
       he places the piece      
       on a plaster block.      

222
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,393
       the porous plaster       
     lets the underside dry     

223
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,196
     without leaving marks.     

224
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,598
       they fire the items      
        in a giant kiln.        

225
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,401
  the kiln heats up gradually,  
       taking eight hours       

226
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,604
       to reach a searing       
    1,800 degrees fahrenheit,   

227
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,808
then 12 more hours to cool down.

228
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,677
  firing hardens the porcelain  

229
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,914
 and enables it to better absorb
        a coat of enamel.       

230
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,355
  after brushing off any dust,  

231
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,756
          the craftsman         
  dunks each piece in enamel -- 

232
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,960
      a protective coating.     

233
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,228
    the porcelain absorbs it    
           right away,          

234
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,497
         and this glaze         
     turns into a shiny skin    

235
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,102
once the pieces are fired again.

236
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,638
     she handles each piece     
       in a particular way      

237
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,841
  to avoid leaving drip marks.  

238
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,112
      in the second firing,     

239
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,114
     they make the porcelain    
           pure white           

240
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,049
    by carefully controlling    
      the air in the kiln.      

241
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,721
    reducing the oxygen level   
 removes any undesirable colors.

242
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,990
           this time,           
  the temperature is higher --  

243
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,326
    2,500 degrees fahrenheit.   

244
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,431
      it shrinks the pieces     
          by about 15%.         

245
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,735
     after a quality check,     

246
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,405
 a craftsman applies the company
   logo with a transfer decal.  

247
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,609
     the logo melts in when     
 the plate goes back in the kiln

248
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:49,480
      for another 12 hours      
  at 1,500 degrees fahrenheit.  

249
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,550
    in the end, the porcelain   
      is translucent enough     

250
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,486
            for light           
     to shine right through.    

251
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,489
       other pieces offer       
    more illustrated displays   

252
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,659
         for an elegant         
       dining experience.       

253
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,702
      narrator: considering     
 how much it costs to fill them,

254
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,106
it's no wonder today's gas tanks
      are made to be tough.     

255
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,840
   factories design a gas tank  

256
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,043
          to safely fit         
    a wide range of vehicles.   

257
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,180
  worldwide, the industry makes 
     60 million tanks a year    

258
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,782
     for new cars and trucks    
        and millions more       

259
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,419
 to replace old or damaged tanks
        in existing cars.       

260
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,262
    making a gas tank begins    
  with a simple sheet of steel. 

261
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:42,467
       it's nickel-plated       
to make the tank rust-resistant.

262
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,303
    a worker places the steel   
      in a hydraulic press      

263
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,872
          that applies          
      800 tons of pressure.     

264
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,474
    this compresses the sheet   
        between two dies        

265
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,744
   that shape the bottom half   
          of the tank.          

266
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,546
  the press forces the male die 
      up against the sheet      

267
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,582
       and into the cavity      
       of the female die.       

268
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,760
      to make the top half      
           of the tank          

269
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,897
    or different-size tanks,    
    they simply change dies.    

270
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,972
   on the tank's top section,   
        a stamping press        

271
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,509
    imprints information such   
 as the product and lot numbers,

272
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,045
  and the manufacturer's name.  

273
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,448
 a hydraulic punch then pierces 
          two holes --          

274
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,852
 one for a tube to fill the tank
     and another to vent it.    

275
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,055
  this machine makes an opening 
         for a component        

276
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,257
called the fuel-delivery module,
             or fdm.            

277
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,661
 it will send fuel to the motor.

278
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,665
    a conveyor moves as many    
  as 180 top sections per hour  

279
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,934
  to the next production phase. 

280
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,270
         there, a worker        
   uses a steel and nylon jig   

281
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,240
     to install a steel ring    
   that will position the fdm.  

282
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,946
     he spot-welds the ring     
          in six spots,         

283
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,515
  fusing it to the top section. 

284
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,521
     two notches on the ring    
  will align the fdm properly.  

285
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,830
      workers tack the top      
  and bottom sections together, 

286
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,430
     aligning them properly     

287
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,334
    for comprehensive welding   
          that follows.         

288
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,972
    two metal wheels compress   
     the sections together,     

289
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,510
   and water cools the area as  
 a machine called a seam-welder 

290
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,946
fuses the upper and lower halves
          of the tank.          

291
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,990
       using a gas torch,       

292
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,193
    a worker fuses steel tube   
  to the tank with lead solder. 

293
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,862
     this is the filler tube    

294
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,063
      into which you insert     
         the gas nozzle         

295
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,932
  when you fill up at the pump. 

296
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:59,136
fuel flows in and air vents out 
through the tube simultaneously.

297
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,939
a sensor automatically shuts off
          the gas pump          

298
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,343
when the air pressure inside the
  tube reaches a certain point. 

299
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,745
         most tanks fill        
   only to about 80% capacity   

300
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:13,484
    to leave room for vapors    
     caused by hot weather.     

301
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,354
      robots weld the tanks     
destined for brand-new vehicles,

302
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,289
   because the work has to be   
     precise and consistent     

303
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,492
         in order to aid        
    the assembly-line robots    

304
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,894
       at the auto plant.       

305
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,763
the human-welded models are sold
      to auto-repair shops      

306
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,699
         as replacements        
       for damaged tanks.       

307
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,701
       they don't require       
       the same precision       

308
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,437
     because a mechanic does    
     a custom installation.     

309
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,178
     when the robots finish     
       welding the tanks,       

310
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,781
       they transfer them       
       to a conveyor belt       

311
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,484
         that moves them        
  to the next production phase. 

312
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,456
    there, a worker attaches    
   a tin-plated venting tube.   

313
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,126
  tin makes it rust-resistant.  

314
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,195
    he adds a steel component   
         called a baffle        

315
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,263
      to the bottom section     
          of the tank.          

316
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,999
    this reduces the sloshing   
    of fuel inside the tank.    

317
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,400
          the result --         

318
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,938
  less noise for the driver and 
less metal fatigue for the tank.

319
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,674
 they're usually just for tanks 
    found in larger vehicles,   

320
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,677
   like suvs and small trucks.  

321
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,552
   a worker now places the top  
section onto the bottom section,

322
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,088
        pulling the hose        
 through the opening in the top.

323
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,158
     this hose will connect     
           to the fdm.          

324
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,295
  after a welding machine fuses 
      both halves together,     

325
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,898
         another machine        
    bends the sides downward.   

326
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,401
      this gives designers      
    extra space to work with.   

327
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:44,642
 they test every tank for leaks 
    by dunking it underwater.   

328
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,810
         after blocking         
   all the holes in the tank,   

329
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,247
  they pump a little extra air  
           inside it.           

330
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,450
they shine bright spotlights and
 look for bubbles in the water. 

331
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,253
       if air can escape,       
        so can gasoline.        

332
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,523
  no bubbles, and the gas tank  
       passes inspection.       

333
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,860
      only then is it ready     
          for shipping          

334
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,763
and a starring role in your car.

335
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,005
