narrator: golfers use different types of clubs     

4
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,857
for different types of shots --               

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,460
woods for long-distance shots off a tee,            

6
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,129
putters to gently roll the ball into the cup,          

7
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,499
and irons for everything in between.    

8
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:07,866
that's why in golf,       

9
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,202
choosing the right club for the shot           

10
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,305
is a key part of game strategy.            

11
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,882
the heads of these golf clubs  

12
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:27,286
are made from aerospace-grade stainless steel.         

13
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,687
to produce them,         

14
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,224
the factory begins with     
a wax replica of the clubhead.  

15
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,760
to make this wax pattern, as it's called,         

16
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,763
they inject hot wax into a mold.              

17
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,165
they extract the pattern     

18
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,935
and snip off the bulk of the excess wax.        

19
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,711
using hot wax as an adhesive,  

20
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:55,180
a robot joins several patterns to other wax parts        

21
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,849
in the shape of gates and runners,           

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,984
the term for the channels    

23
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,821
that guide molten metal into the casting mold.      

24
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,391
then the robot dips these patterns          

25
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:08,393
into liquid ceramic material four times,           

26
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,064
with a shower of silica sand in between each coat.      

27
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,132
the ceramic and sand harden,   

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,069
forming a shell around the wax patterns.     

29
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,872
then the factory melts out the wax.        

30
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:21,874
the shell is now a mold     

31
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:25,344
with which to cast the metal clubheads.       

32
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,946
on the casting floor,      

33
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:31,150
a furnace heats steel bars   
to 3,000 degrees fahrenheit --  

34
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,285
well beyond the melting point.  

35
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,421
meanwhile, another furnace heats the molds         

36
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,423
to 1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

37
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,294
this burns out any remaining wax.        

38
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,030
it also fires the ceramic,    

39
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:47,766
making it strong enough to withstand molten metal.    

40
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,502
the pouring technique is critical.           

41
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,971
the metal must flow at a consistent rate       

42
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:57,443
to prevent the formation of air bubbles.         

43
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,311
after five hours,        

44
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,714
a pneumatic hammer breaks apart the mold.      

45
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,254
workers saw off the gates and runners,           

46
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,590
separating the clubheads.    

47
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,058
then they grind off       

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,062
the last remnants of the gates and runners.    

49
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,403
a turntable runs the clubheads through a sandblaster,      

50
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,107
which gives the metal a particular finish.       

51
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,746
next, they stick on a metal badge          

52
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,750
bearing the club's model name.  

53
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,686
they apply a dot of automotive paint.    

54
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,355
the color identifies the angle of the club.      

55
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,058
there are 12 different angles.  

56
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,764
now they line the neck of the clubhead with epoxy,   

57
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,433
then coat the end of the shaft with epoxy            

58
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,102
and slip it into the neck.    

59
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:01,440
a pneumatic hammer pushes the shaft in as as far as it can go.               

60
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:05,778
the shaft is made of either extruded steel or carbon fiber.             

61
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,316
now it's time to work on the shaft.      

62
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,452
first, they cut it to the right length,       

63
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,521
depending on the model.     

64
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,928
then they put the shaft on a spindle           

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,064
and wrap the top 10 inches in double-sided tape       

66
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,033
to hold the club's rubber grip.              

67
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,876
they lubricate the tape and the inside of the grip    

68
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,479
before sliding the grip over the shaft.         

69
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,282
a laser line helps them align the grip in the right position.            

70
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,953
this is critical, because    
the grip is the golfer's guide  

71
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,354
to correct hand positioning,   

72
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,691
which is essential to a good swing.         

73
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,895
next, a computer reads the lie,              

74
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:59,565
the term for the clubhead's angle relative to the ground.  

75
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,233
then it reads the loft --    

76
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,436
the term for the angle of the clubhead's face.     

77
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,838
the computer then tells the technician          

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,241
what adjustments to make.    

79
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,776
once he's made the adjustments,          

80
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,779
the computer reanalyzes the new loft and lie       

81
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,148
to ensure they're perfect.    

82
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:23,722
finally, the golf club goes for a weigh-in.         

83
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,791
the scale shows that this club  

84
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,194
needs another 18 grams to bring it up to spec,     

85
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,531
so they affix an 18-gram weight made of thermoplastic and metal.             

86
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,202
actually, it weighs slightly less than 18 grams,   

87
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,306
because they factor in the weight of the epoxy glue.  

88
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,611
it's this type of precision that ensure these golf clubs   

89
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,581
fit the quality specifications to a "t."            

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,968
narrator: the waffle started out in the middle ages        

91
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,103
as a flat wafer made not from wheat flour,      

92
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,705
but from oats or barley.     

93
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,307
as its popularity spread throughout europe,        

94
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,176
many variations of shape and recipe developed.      

95
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,712
the introduction of leavening ingredients     

96
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,848
gave rise to the fluffy honeycomb breakfast cake     

97
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,251
we know today.          

98
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,858
the introduction        
of frozen waffles in the 1950s  

99
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,062
marked the dawn of a new era for these breakfast batter cakes.  

100
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,299
making your morning waffles was suddenly a snap.       

101
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,739
all the big prep work takes place at the big factory.            

102
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,677
they add flavorings like berries to a flour-based waffle mix,   

103
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,880
and then turn to the liquid ingredients --   

104
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,683
water, canola oil, and liquid cane sugar.      

105
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,953
they pour them into a big tank and mix thoroughly.       

106
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,289
then they're ready to thicken it into a batter          

107
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,625
with a flour-based waffle premix.          

108
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,229
it also includes baking powder, which reacts with water     

109
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,965
to cause pockets of carbon dioxide to form    

110
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:17,302
for a leavening affect that will continue during baking.   

111
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,906
after adding more berries, this batter is complete,     

112
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,108
and there's enough in this one tank         

113
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,910
to produce 3,600 waffles.    

114
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,580
hot waffle irons move past a sprayer       

115
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,384
for a misting with a nonstick coating.     

116
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,920
down the line, an automated pump              

117
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,223
deposits measured amounts of batter onto each grid plate.             

118
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,796
the top grid plates encase the batter.        

119
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,800
this production line is computerized,         

120
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,602
which ensures the plates are filled quickly        

121
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,037
and without any spills.     

122
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,415
as they move towards the oven, the waffle irons rotate,     

123
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,119
allowing the batter to reach all the crevices inside.     

124
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,157
they now move through a long gas oven.     

125
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,060
it takes about two minutes for them to cook.        

126
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,099
they emerge from the oven piping-hot,           

127
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,101
where a machine called a picking drum      

128
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,238
removes them from the irons.   

129
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,574
as the picking drum revolves, needles grab the waffles     

130
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,611
and pull them off the hot grid plates.     

131
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:42,554
the picking drum transports the waffles up to another level.             

132
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,529
the needles retract,       

133
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,232
transferring to a series of conveyors.    

134
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,739
at the other side of the factory,         

135
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,609
the waffles enter a blast freezer.         

136
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,049
the temperature inside is minus 19 degrees fahrenheit.           

137
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,554
fans blow frigid air onto the waffles         

138
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,022
as they spiral through the freezer.       

139
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,491
it takes just 20 minutes     

140
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:23,162
to freeze and preserve these freshly baked waffles.   

141
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,634
the frozen waffles now merge into lanes       

142
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:32,204
to be sorted for stacking.    

143
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:38,043
a kind of trap-door system releases them three at a time  

144
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,913
to grippers that move them onto a conveyor.         

145
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,390
the conveyor lane narrows,    

146
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,594
which forces the waffle stacks into a single row.        

147
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,664
a sensor-activated gate releases the stacks       

148
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:04,002
two at a time to the packaging station.    

149
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,739
it takes just a second for the two stacks of frozen waffles             

150
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,577
to be wrapped and sealed    
in a tight cellophane package.  

151
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,218
then it's into a metal detector.            

152
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,286
to demonstrate how it works,   

153
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,821
we place a quarter on one of the packages.     

154
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,091
the system senses it immediately,           

155
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:30,062
and a blower blasts the package off the conveyor.        

156
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,034
suctioning fingers now pick up the outer paperboard box     

157
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,804
and open it as they place it on the conveyor.         

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,810
a ram then shoves the wrapped waffles into the box.      

159
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,981
incredibly, they churn out    

160
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,584
more than 8,600 waffles an hour at this factory,         

161
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,921
catering to different tastes and dietary requirements,    

162
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,458
and that merits a toast.     

163
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,411
narrator: much of today's high-tech equipment       

164
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,214
requires specialty wires and cables,           

165
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,684
from stage lighting to medical devices to robotics.            

166
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,687
wires and cables have to be custom designed    

167
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,490
and expertly manufactured to perform in a specific way   

168
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,061
and withstand various environmental conditions.    

169
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,701
cables can be designed     
to withstand high temperatures  

170
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,636
or perform special functions   

171
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:49,975
such as sensing ph levels or proximity to objects.     

172
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,576
at the heart of a cable     

173
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,178
are electrical wires called conductors.        

174
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,983
a conductor begins as a bare copper wire.      

175
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,820
this extrusion machine coats it in plastic.       

176
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,858
chilled water solidifies the plastic around the wire   

177
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
as insulation.          

178
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,063
this isolates each wire from its neighbors.       

179
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,401
every conductor passes through a machine called a spark tester.             

180
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,670
it runs current through the conductor      

181
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,073
to ensure the insulation is flawless.   

182
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:24,810
if there's even the smallest break in the insulation,     

183
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,413
the machine will sound the alarm and locate the spot.       

184
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,088
the conductor then enters a machine called a cabler.    

185
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,690
it unrolls spools of insulated conductors     

186
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,626
and unites them with other components      

187
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,362
to form the cable's inner workings.         

188
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:46,298
at the center of this particular cable     

189
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,701
is a twisted pair of insulated conductors.     

190
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,572
around them go color-coated insulated conductors       

191
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:57,108
and fillers to fill in the gaps between the conductors,     

192
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,846
giving the cable a smooth, cylindrical shape.        

193
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,983
here the fillers are strands of polypropylene foam.      

194
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,453
an orientation plate aligns the components      

195
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,588
in the proper configuration   

196
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,092
as they enter the cable-assembly die.     

197
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,796
the components exit the die   

198
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,666
with the fillers wound around the insulated conductors,    

199
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,403
which wrap around the central wire.        

200
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,139
the next machine, called a taping head,      

201
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,076
wraps binder tape around the cable.        

202
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,812
this tape holds everything tightly in position       

203
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,149
so that the assembled components don't unravel.          

204
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:44,556
this is a different type of cable assembly machine.    

205
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,023
like before,           

206
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,494
all the insulated conductors unroll from their reels     

207
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,964
and travel through the holes of an orientation plate.     

208
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,434
dies divide the six conductors of this cable          

209
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,503
into three groups of two,    

210
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:03,107
twisting the conductors of each pair together.      

211
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,511
the machine then wraps each twisted pair        

212
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,914
in a shield made of aluminum-coated polyester.  

213
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,517
shielding eliminates what's known as cross talk --  

214
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,919
signals interfering with each other.         

215
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,988
the next die joins additional wires      

216
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,558
that don't need to be shielded to the shielded ones.      

217
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,862
then everything gets twisted into one cable.         

218
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:27,732
then a final twisting, seen here in slow motion.    

219
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:32,904
the actual speed is 1,000 revolutions per minute.             

220
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:38,209
the next machine wraps     
tissue paper around the cable.  

221
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,012
then an extruder applies a jacket         

222
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,748
made of a plastic and rubber compound.       

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,418
the tissue paper acts as a separator,       

224
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,288
preventing the jacket from sticking to the cable inside.  

225
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,898
sometimes, instead of tissue paper,     

226
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,567
the cable runs through a bath of talc.         

227
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,903
talc is a mineral that absorbs heat,        

228
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,771
so just like tissue paper,    

229
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,374
it prevents the jacket from sticking.          

230
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,382
once again, as the cable exits the extruder,          

231
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:21,586
chilled water solidifies the  
molten material into a jacket.  

232
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,056
a wheel with raised lettering imprints the manufacturer's name              

233
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:29,995
and technical specifications into the jacket.         

234
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,664
certain jacketed cables need a braided shield      

235
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,934
to eliminate electrical interference.     

236
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,303
this machine has 48 carrier spools,      

237
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:42,941
each of which holds 10 wires made of tin-plated copper.    

238
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,211
as they jacketed cable moves upward through the machine,   

239
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,412
the spools move in a programmed pattern,     

240
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,283
weaving the shield around the cable.        

241
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,358
from there, a last trip through the extruder       

242
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,163
for a final thermoplastic jacket...     

243
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,764
and the custom-made cable    

244
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,035
is ready to be connected and powered up.         

245
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,757
narrator: train wheels are used on railcars around the world.  

246
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,693
passenger trains rely on them to transport people.       

247
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,696
freight cars depend on them for hauling products.      

248
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,100
and the locomotives that pull these trains and freight cars  

249
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:46,071
count on them to keep people and products moving smoothly.  

250
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,646
this company has been making train wheels and axles      

251
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,048
for over 150 years.       

252
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:02,653
to start, an electric furnace melts recycled steel       

253
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,690
at about 2,900 degrees fahrenheit.    

254
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,265
a gigantic bucket then transfers the liquid metal         

255
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,002
into what's called a mold pit.  

256
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:22,006
inside the pit, the metal fills eight holes from the bottom up,               

257
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,410
creating steel ingots 20-feet-long.          

258
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,285
a band saw cuts the cooled ingots      

259
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,355
into sections called wheel molts.           

260
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,492
each molt weighs about 1,000 pounds.    

261
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,232
to prepare the molts      
for forming into train wheels,  

262
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,967
automated machinery loads them  

263
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:52,904
into one door of this rotary furnace...    

264
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,876
and they exit the other side at around 2,400 degrees fahrenheit.           

265
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,517
a machine then places the molts              

266
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,786
into a high-pressure water-descaling unit       

267
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:11,056
that removes the outermost layer of metal.  

268
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,129
a press then squashes each molt like a marshmallow        

269
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,931
with 9,000 tons of pressure,   

270
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,768
forging it into the rough shape of a train wheel.        

271
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,010
the train wheel is 30 inches in diameter     

272
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,545
when a robot removes it from the press          

273
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,948
and delivers it to a rolling mill.        

274
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,154
the mill squeezes and shapes the wheel       

275
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:48,126
until it expands to 36 inches in diameter, a 20% increase.   

276
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,038
the train wheel then enters a final shaping press      

277
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,441
that punches out the hole where the axle will go.     

278
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,949
all excess material goes back to the melt shop for recycling.           

279
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,853
after heat treatment,      

280
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,324
a machine sprays the outside of the wheel with cold water,  

281
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,860
which hardens the steel.     

282
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:27,232
next, they machine the rim of the wheel and the axle hole.              

283
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,072
a worker then ensures they meet all specifications.  

284
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,811
identified and labeled,     

285
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,248
the wheels are now ready for the axles.          

286
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,622
axles start off as steel ingots             

287
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,392
that a manipulator feeds    
into a rotary forging machine.  

288
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,364
the machine rotates and hammers the piece,      

289
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,867
gradually shaping the hot metal into an axle.          

290
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:13,644
the manipulator and the forging machine work as a team,     

291
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,780
ultimately shaping the axle   

292
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,683
to the required diameter and length.           

293
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,696
the axles then go through a heat-treating process.     

294
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,201
next, they machine the entire axle,         

295
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:39,337
removing all excess material,  

296
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:42,240
and prepare it to accept the train wheel.    

297
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,812
here, a wheel mounting press   

298
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,615
fits a wheel onto each end of the axle.    

299
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,626
a worker lubricates the axle and attaches a bearing.     

300
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,498
he then bolts on the end cap   

301
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,902
and secures it using a torque wrench.      

302
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,508
a crimper tool locks the bolts in place.    

303
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,779
finally, the mounted wheel set rolls off the assembly line,   

304
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,616
ready to install under a rail car.        

305
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,926
