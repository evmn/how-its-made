narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,093
pistons...           

3
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,966
...paint rollers...      

4
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,671
...parachutes...        

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,545
...and chimneys.        

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,655
pistons are key to the internal combustion process

7
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,056
that drives engines.      

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,725
a piston is a plug that slides up and down    

9
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,528
inside each engine cylinder,  

10
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,997
compressing gas and air ignited by a spark plug.    

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,867
the resulting energy turns the crankshaft      

12
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,402
and drives the engine.     

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,348
this company makes 9,000 different types of pistons   

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,087
for everything from dirt bikes to car engines.        

15
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,491
a piston starts out as a 10-foot-long aluminum rod.  

16
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,494
aluminum is ideal because it's a lightweight   

17
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:39,364
and rust-resistant metal that's easy to cut.      

18
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,633
a rotary saw slices the rod into slugs,   

19
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,635
the length of which can be changed         

20
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,370
by adjusting the feeder machine

21
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,107
to push the rod at different intervals.    

22
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,912
this piston model requires 2.7-inch slugs.    

23
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:58,584
the factory recycles excess aluminum shavings.   

24
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,856
the punch press and die    

25
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,592
are preheated to 800 degrees fahrenheit,   

26
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,063
the temperature required to forge the slugs.      

27
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,566
the slugs are brought to the same temperature in an oven.  

28
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,872
the punch applies 2,000 tons of pressure          

29
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,842
to form it into        
the initial shape of the piston.

30
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,749
he dunks about 1 in 10 forgings
in water to check for defects. 

31
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,558
to make forging easier,    

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,694
they pre-lube the slugs before heating them.      

33
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,897
that's why the slug flames up when struck by the press.   

34
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,167
it only takes two seconds for the press to do its job,  

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,036
but the forgings are so hot,  

36
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:55,307
they need at least an hour to cool before the next step. 

37
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,843
workers heat the forgings twice more,          

38
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,512
the first time at very high heat
to strengthen the metal,    

39
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,316
the second time at a lower heat
to stabilize it.        

40
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,193
now they insert each slug in a lathe           

41
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,594
to give the forging the correct shape       

42
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,797
for machines that handle it later.     

43
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,472
these small holes allow oil to flow through        

44
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,108
to lubricate the piston when it's in use.       

45
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,481
another lathe reduces the diameter by an 1/8 of an inch. 

46
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,217
the same machine then cuts three grooves,    

47
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,088
two for compression rings and 
another for an oil-control ring.

48
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,223
these rings help the piston glide     

49
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,993
and enable it to provide an airtight seal.       

50
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,564
this hole is for the wrist pin 

51
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,267
that will attach the piston to a connecting rod.      

52
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,772
a milling machine then shaves off        

53
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,309
up to 3/4 of an inch of metal from two sides of the piston  

54
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,444
to reduce the overall weight. 

55
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,148
the white liquid is lubricant 
to cool the area during cutting.

56
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,787
another milling machine    

57
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,123
cuts away part of what they call the dome.  

58
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,791
this way it will clear other parts   

59
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,793
when moving inside the cylinder.

60
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,130
the pistons must be just the right shape and size.   

61
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,200
some of them move up and down as
much as 6,000 times per minute 

62
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,136
when the engine is running.  

63
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,576
next, a lathe shaves a hair width more of the metal 

64
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,078
from the outside.       

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,747
this cut enables the piston to expand slightly       

66
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,150
when heat builds up inside the cylinder.      

67
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,487
an automated drill makes two intersecting oil-drain holes  

68
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,956
to enhance lubrication of the wrist pin.       

69
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,801
another machine now engraves model and production data.   

70
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,973
here, a worker removes sharp edges      

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,376
created during previous operations.      

72
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,647
he then uses a belt sander to further smooth out the surface.

73
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,350
sharp edges could damage cylinder walls.  

74
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,655
this cutting machine shaves off a bit of metal   

75
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,923
inside the pinhole       

76
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,526
so the wrist pin will fit snugly inside.    

77
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,432
once the cutting is complete, high-pressure jets       

78
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,401
spray the pistons with hot, deionized water.   

79
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,871
this cleaning removes all traces
of lubricant and oil.     

80
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,074
after a blow-dry with an air gun,        

81
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,676
the pistons are ready to be installed.        

82
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,292
narrator: norman breakey, a canadian,  

83
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,427
invented the paint roller in 1940.            

84
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,563
it revolutionized painting, but breakey never got rich   

85
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,633
because he lacked the financial
means to defend his patent.  

86
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,169
over the next 60-odd years, the paint roller,       

87
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,505
with its replaceable cylindrical refill,       

88
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:17,209
became the primary painting tool, alongside the paintbrush.

89
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,250
the refill is a tube covered in fabric       

90
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,319
made from either polyester fiber

91
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,989
or lint-free acrylic and nylon fiber.        

92
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,927
regardless of fabric, all refills are made the same way. 

93
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:40,732
the fabric is processed into a 2.8-inch-wide strip.  

94
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,035
it goes into a machine called an automatic tube winder.   

95
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,673
it first applies epoxy glue  

96
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,142
to the surface of pvc plastic tubes.     

97
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,878
as the tension bar pulls the fabric strip taut,     

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,481
the machine winds the fabric around a tube.         

99
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,351
an air jet pushes aside the wound fabric        

100
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,087
to avoid bumps as more is applied.      

101
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,892
once the tube is covered with fabric,          

102
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,495
the machine simultaneously wraps the end  

103
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,465
and the start of the next tube in masking tape.        

104
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,769
once the glue has dried for eight hours,        

105
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,406
the tubes enter a machine that cuts them into several refills.

106
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,118
the tube spins as it passes,  

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,522
so one small cut is enough to sever it.          

108
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,593
one tube produces 9 7 1/2-inch-long refills    

109
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,796
or 7 9 1/2-inch-long refills,    

110
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,098
the two standard sizes on the market.         

111
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,609
the next machine first runs a wire brush against the fabric. 

112
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,111
this lifts and fluffs the pile...          

113
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,783
...then makes a beveled edge on each end.          

114
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:15,894
to fluff the fabric further, a high-speed spin at 3,500 rpm.

115
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,799
during all these operations, a vacuum sucks away loose fibers.

116
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,707
meanwhile, the paint-roller handles take shape.      

117
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,776
an injection molding machine  

118
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,313
shoots molten plastic into handle-shaped cavities.  

119
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,981
a built-in cooling system   

120
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,384
hardens the plastic within seconds.        

121
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,589
the handles are made of polypropylene,       

122
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,324
a semi-tough thermoplastic,  

123
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,995
and some colored polyethylene, a lightweight thermoplastic.  

124
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,664
now that the handles and refills
are made,           

125
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,066
it's just a matter of assembling them.      

126
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,136
these plastic bearings hold the components together. 

127
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,642
the assembly is entirely automated.     

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,280
the bottom bearing goes on first.         

129
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,016
it rests against the part called the shoulder.      

130
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,654
next, the refill.       

131
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,960
the bottom bearing slots right into the open end of the tube. 

132
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,801
now the top bearing goes on.  

133
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,114
a metal clip locks the bearings
and roller in place.      

134
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,795
and, voilà, a three-inch roller
for painting windows and trims.

135
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,267
this factory also makes disposable plastic paint trays 

136
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,802
and tray liners.        

137
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:07,739
they're made of polyethylene  
terephthalate, p.e.t. for short,

138
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,609
a type of plastic that's strong
yet flexible.         

139
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,084
this thermoform machine heats a p.e.t. sheet,     

140
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,221
then vacuums it into a tray-shaped mold.    

141
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,690
fans cool and harden the plastic.          

142
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,360
this heat mold-and-cool cycle takes just 30 to 50 seconds,  

143
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,631
depending on the tray thickness.

144
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,099
the molded sheets go into a cutter.       

145
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,702
it excises the tray in one slice.         

146
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,638
the factory grinds up the leftover plastic      

147
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,576
and sends it back to the supplier for recycling. 

148
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,579
this factory also makes roller refills for applying solvents. 

149
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,651
instead of pvc, the tube inside
is made of a tougher material, 

150
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,388
either a chemically strengthened
cardboard or a polypropylene.

00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,132
narrator: daredevils have   
parachuted from cliffs or towers

152
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,399
for centuries.         

153
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,001
when airplanes first took off, 

154
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,537
so did parachutes as the best escape.      

155
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,273
today's aerodynamic, lightweight chutes       

156
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,008
enable cargo and people to descend safely       

157
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,245
and land right on target.   

158
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,621
this company makes military parachutes.   

159
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,060
each one has a 30-foot wingspan
and carries up to 440 pounds. 

160
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,100
making the chute's canopy   

161
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,838
starts with a rugged woven   
nylon fabric with nylon ribbing.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,841
this light table lets a worker detect any flaws in the fabric.

163
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,511
the alignment between the ribbing must be consistent,

164
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,614
spaced no more than 1.5 inches apart.     

165
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,385
they test the strength of the fabric         

166
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,521
by pulling the material until it rips.         

167
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,990
to pass, the fabric must withstand   

168
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,760
a minimum of 44 pounds of pulling force.       

169
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,469
a laser cuts out the parachute parts,      

170
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,739
30 to 100 of them, depending on the model.    

171
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,342
a vacuum system stabilizes the fabric     

172
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,411
by sucking it to the table during cutting.        

173
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,013
the fabric is usually silver-colored   

174
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,484
to blend in against the daytime sky.        

175
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,425
a seamstress now sews on nylon tape     

176
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,761
to attach the parts and reinforce the seams.    

177
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,765
some panels have holes about the size of a dinner plate   

178
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,567
to funnel air between the two layers of the canopy  

179
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,870
and keep it rigid during flight.

180
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,039
once they finish sewing,    

181
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,842
workers meticulously inspect the stitching.         

182
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,913
every inch of stitching must have between 7 and 10 stitches.

183
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,785
if the stitching is too close or too far apart,       

184
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,055
the fabric could rip, and that's
the last thing you want    

185
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,723
when your chute is descending 

186
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,126
at a rate of up to 13 feet per second.  

187
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,062
so they mark any problem spots with a red ribbon       

188
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,631
and resew them.        

189
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,605
here, a worker sews nylon tape 

190
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,141
to reinforce an area called a flare,    

191
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,810
which is a triangular patch of nylon            

192
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,880
reinforced with silicone coating.     

193
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,749
she loops the tape at one of the flare's points  

194
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,686
to later insert        
what's called a suspension line.

195
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,089
the 60 lines link the 60 flares
on the canopy         

196
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,025
to the jumper's harness.    

197
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,761
to reinforce each flare,    

198
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:53,131
she sews 42 zigzag stitches in a 1-inch area.       

199
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,971
the nylon suspension line arrives on spools,       

200
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,274
so workers use this machine to stretch it straight.    

201
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,663
a worker marks off up to 14 1/2 feet per line   

202
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,200
and cuts it on an angle to reduce fraying.       

203
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,435
workers later sew the ends into loops           

204
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,572
so they can attach each one to the loop on the flares.   

205
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,077
a worker makes a lark's head knot in each line

206
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,546
and ties it to a flare.    

207
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,616
this type of knot is easy to undo if a line needs replacing.

208
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,087
connecting the 60 lines to the canopy's 60 flares   

209
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,421
takes about two hours.     

210
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,690
only after all these knots are secure           

211
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,092
can they pack the chute into the backpack       

212
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,161
and ship it to the customer.  

213
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,901
the nylon backpack has two identical parachutes, 

214
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,035
the main chute and a reserve. 

215
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,238
this worker is sewing the panels

216
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,707
that will encase the reserve chute.       

217
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,442
extra stitching reinforces   

218
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,178
the strap connecting the steel buckle,       

219
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,448
which fastens an extra pack for up to 100 pounds.     

220
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,920
it's critical to strictly follow
the company's instructions   

221
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,255
when packing the chute.    

222
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,192
you roll the ends, then fold the rest into layers.

223
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,262
before each jump, you have to untangle the lines 

224
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,165
and check for any tears from the previous jump.    

225
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,237
then you insert the lines and canopy into the pack.   

226
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,543
you pull on this red nylon   
handle to deploy the main chute.

227
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,414
the yellow handle is for the reserve chute.   

228
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,749
there are straps over the shoulders,      

229
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,551
chest, belly, and legs.    

230
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:57,322
and three buckles attach the harness to the jumper.   

231
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,503
narrator: your home's chimney vents hot gases or smoke    

232
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,638
from your fireplace to the outside.        

233
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,042
some types also channel air to the fire to keep it burning.

234
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,977
although the concept's very old,

235
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,513
today's chimneys have come a long way.     

236
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,716
they're energy-efficient and modular,          

237
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,218
so you can easily assemble them
yourself.           

238
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,656
this company makes chimneys  

239
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,660
for gas-fired and wood-burning fireplaces.  

240
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,465
a chimney's inner chamber is called a flue.       

241
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,400
for a wood-burning fireplace, 

242
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,803
they make the flue from stainless steel.     

243
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,405
workers unwind a sheet,    

244
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,409
then slice it to the size of  
the flue section they're making.

245
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,679
the sections are up to 10 inches wide and 4 feet long.

246
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,484
they assemble as many as they 
need to make a complete chimney.

247
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,487
here, a worker folds the edges in opposite directions,    

248
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,623
which will enable them to interlock.         

249
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,358
rollers then curl the sheet into a cylinder.        

250
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,294
the metal is only about as thick

251
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,830
as four pieces of paper stacked together.       

252
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,099
this keeps the chimney lightweight.          

253
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,239
they weld together the top and bottom ends,        

254
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,509
and a roller flattens the welded seam.   

255
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,717
they insert the bottom     
of the flue between two rollers.

256
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,388
they form a ridge to which a coupler will later attach.  

257
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,126
they crimp the metal at the top
so it can also hold a coupler. 

258
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,001
to make top-end couplers, a die punches the shape    

259
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,070
from lubricated sheets of stainless steel.      

260
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,940
a robotic arm then suctions out the coupler 

261
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,808
and places it onto another machine      

262
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,044
that cuts threads into the sides of it.     

263
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,884
these threads enable the chimney sections  

264
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,619
to twist and lock together.  

265
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,558
to attach the coupler,     

266
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,228
the worker mounts it on top of the flue.       

267
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,035
a roller then pushes against the flue in the coupler.    

268
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,438
this expands the metal     
and secures the pieces together.

269
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,109
now to join the flue with the outer casing.     

270
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,912
an eight-sided die pushes out against a coupler       

271
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,348
to attach it to the flue in the casing.         

272
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,588
they insulate the chimney with shredded ceramic fiber  

273
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,389
that can withstand a temperature

274
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,792
of up to 2,100 degrees fahrenheit.   

275
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,129
workers feed the fiber into a machine         

276
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,799
that packs it into the cavity 
between the flue and the casing.

277
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,007
the machine then moves the chimney to another station 

278
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,177
where it twists a coupler to the
bottom end to close the cavity. 

279
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,619
after a quick brushing to remove any fiber dust,   

280
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,755
a mechanical arm lifts the chimney       

281
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,057
and moves it to be boxed and shipped.          

282
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,165
a gas-burning fireplace generates less heat      

283
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,832
and fewer corrosive gases,   

284
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,169
so the chimney flue is made of aluminum-coated steel    

285
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,972
and a casing of a zinc-aluminum alloy --  

286
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,641
more-affordable materials,   

287
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,310
yet still well above safety standards.       

288
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,846
the air space between the flue and casing           

289
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,116
provides the required insulation.    

290
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,785
a worker places the flue inside an automated welder.  

291
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,523
it fuses the edges with a laser
that's as thin as a human hair.

292
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,524
this is called a butt laser weld

293
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,596
because the machine butts the edges together and bonds them. 

294
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:09,339
next, an eight-sided die indents
the section with three ridges. 

295
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,910
a component will fit into these indentations later. 

296
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,482
here, a machine creates a star-shaped component    

297
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,750
called a spacer.        

298
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,020
they use two of them to center the flue in the casing.

a worker installs one at each end of the flue.    

300
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,042
he then inserts the flue into the casing        

301
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,112
and twists it to lock the spacers into the ridges.  

302
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,116
this connects and aligns the chimney sections properly. 

303
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,588
the tops of chimneys have steel rain caps.     

304
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,791
they let smoke and gases vent but keep rain out,       

305
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:04,061
ensuring that where's there's smoke, there is indeed fire.
