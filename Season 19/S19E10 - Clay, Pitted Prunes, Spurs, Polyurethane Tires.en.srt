00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,120
narrator: the origin of so many
useful things is muddy --   

2
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,990
from bricks to tiles to dinnerware.         

3
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,060
even the kitchen sink can be made from clay.     

4
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,461
clay is a component of soil  

5
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,131
that, when wet, has a certain plasticity    

6
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,467
that allows it to be shaped into hundreds of things.    

7
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,807
there are many shades of clay. 

8
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,276
the whitest is the purest and used to manufacture    

9
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:21,146
things like dinnerware, sinks, and tiles.       

10
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,615
clay isn't just dirt.     

11
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,618
it's one of the most valuable resources on earth.      

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,887
to find it,          

13
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,956
they excavate topsoil and gravel
at this site in kentucky.   

14
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,293
they dig down as far as 80 feet.

15
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:39,632
the deeper they go, the whiter the clay.      

16
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:43,102
a loader transfers it to a truck
for transport.         

17
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,904
fresh from the earth,     

18
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:49,775
the moisture content of the clay
is between 15% and 22%.    

19
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,178
the particles of clay clump together,        

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,847
but the clumps can be easily broken up.    

21
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,119
the clay will now be processed to a workable form.      

22
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:04,790
it's a short drive from the clay pit to the factory.  

23
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,393
they unload it in a building without walls  

24
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,796
so it will air dry a bit.   

25
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,066
they do a visual inspection of the color and consistency. 

26
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,401
every few loads,        

27
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,738
they also do a chemical analysis
of the mineral content.    

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,672
this allows them to categorize the clay     

29
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,807
for specific purposes     

30
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,745
and for blending in different clay recipes.   

31
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:31,617
next, they transfer the clay to a revolving tub.      

32
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,686
the tub has knives that protrude up into it.   

33
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,223
as it spins,          
the knives hit the lumps of clay

34
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:41,827
to chop them into smaller pieces.      

35
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,563
these smaller clay chunks flow out of the chopper    

36
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,133
and ride a conveyor into a hopper.         

37
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:53,706
the hopper feeds the clay to a mill.           

38
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,909
en route to the mill,     
the clay travels through fire --

39
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,645
a flame generated by a furnace below.      

40
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,448
this is called flash drying,  

41
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,651
and it brings the moisture content down to 1% to 2% --  

42
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,853
the right consistency to now grind it        

43
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,022
into a fine powder.      

44
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,595
the grinding mill is a shaft with numerous hammers     

45
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,131
sandwiched between steel plates.

46
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,601
as the shaft turns, the hammers will swing     

47
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,571
to grind the clay lumps into a powder.         

48
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,875
the mill will also blend different kinds of clay     

49
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,344
to create specific products.  

50
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:36,348
they put the cover on the mill and set it in motion.     

51
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,351
the hammers pulverize the different clays into a powder. 

52
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,756
overhead, a machine sucks up the ground clay,   

53
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,492
using spinning blades and a vacuum.         

54
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,894
the cyclone effect lifts up the clay particles  

55
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,698
and leaves heavier impurities like sand behind.       

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,168
the result is a purer clay blend.     

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,302
here are various clays     

58
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,906
now dried, pulverized, and purified.         

59
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,975
they run numerous tests on clay.

60
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,779
for this one, the technician presses the clay powder    

61
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,116
into a cake-like disc, using a hydraulic press.    

62
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,451
at the same time, he weighs the clay.      

63
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,453
weight can indicate the clay's pliability     

64
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,058
and the speed at which it can be cast.    

65
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,727
he fires the clay disc in an oven overnight      

66
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,062
and examines the color     

67
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,999
to confirm that it's the desired hue.   

68
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,868
over at the packaging station, 

69
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,204
a worker hangs open bags on spouts,           

70
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,641
which will fill the bags full of dry powdered clay.   

71
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,814
the customer will add water and other ingredients     

72
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,015
to turn this particular blend into a glaze          

73
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,684
for things like tiles and sinks.

74
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:51,156
in powdered form, the clay is lighter and cheaper to ship.

75
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,692
some customers prefer wet-processed clay,      

76
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,227
even though it's heavier.   

77
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,864
for that, they add water and chemicals to make a slurry.

78
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,367
they pump the slurry through a sieve        

79
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,437
to screen out impurities.   

80
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,573
the clay slurry now flows into big mixing tanks,     

81
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,778
where it remains in a constant state of agitation. 

82
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,848
continuous mixing keeps it fluid.        

83
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,182
without it, the clay would thicken     

84
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,084
to the consistency of peanut butter.        

85
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:24,056
on delivery day,        
they pump it into tanker trucks.

86
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,592
at another factory, this particular batch     

87
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,194
will be used to make sinks or tubs.     

88
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,798
the next trucks will likely be headed somewhere else.   

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,136
you never know what will be made
from this product of the earth. 

90
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,288
narrator: among dried fruits,      

91
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,958
none inspires a gut reaction like prunes.          

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,359
eating them is one way     

93
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,562
to kick-start a lethargic gastrointestinal system.    

94
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:08,500
high in fiber, sweet and chewy, 
prunes are actually dried plums,

95
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:13,372
and they're a delicacy that's as old as civilization itself. 

96
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,577
prunes have been found in ancient egyptian tombs,   

97
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,912
placed there to snack on    

98
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,182
during the journey to the next world.       

99
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,984
fast-forward to today,     

100
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:27,720
and people are still snacking on prunes.           

101
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,189
they also add them to salads, muffins,            

102
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,858
and main-course recipes.    

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,927
it all starts with the growing stock.    

104
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,264
not all varieties of plums are suitable for drying.    

105
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,399
at this california orchard,  

106
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,203
they grow the d'agen plum -- a european variety.      

107
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,872
harvesting machines shake the trees by the trunks, 

108
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,141
and the fruit rains down onto a conveyor,        

109
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,611
which delivers it to bins.   

110
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,080
they then truck the plums to the receiving plant...   

111
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:02,153
...and unload them directly into a washing system.

112
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,357
tree leaves float to the surface
of the water to be removed.  

113
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,627
the plums exit onto a table that vibrates         

114
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,762
to distribute them evenly   

115
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,564
so they land on trays in fairly equal amounts.    

116
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:17,169
a paddle overhead levels them on the trays.   

117
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,372
machinery stacks the trays of plums on racks.  

118
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,841
the plums are now ready to dry.

119
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,312
they're about 80% water when they enter the dryer.   

120
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,513
16 hours of heat exposure   

121
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,785
brings the moisture content down to 19%.          

122
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:35,920
plums were once sun-dried as a means of preservation,  

123
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:41,060
but a modern industrial dryer produces more uniform results. 

124
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,128
the dried plums travel under a vacuum     

125
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,197
that sucks out sticks or stems.

126
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,735
then the prunes travel to a shaking conveyor      

127
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:53,138
with a lot of different-sized holes.   

128
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,540
the first holes are the smallest,       

129
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,542
and they become progressively larger      

130
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,012
to sort the prunes by size.  

131
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,814
they fall into separate bins below.   

132
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,152
the smallest fruit will be used
for breakfast or diced product.

133
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:11,556
the largest prunes will end up as snack food.   

134
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,826
preserved by drying and now sorted,        

135
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:17,896
they can be stored for months until processing.       

136
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,698
at the processing plant,    

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,034
the prunes head into a super-sized steam cooker.  

138
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,604
they spend 18 minutes in there.

139
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,641
the steam cooking partially rehydrates them,   

140
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:34,646
softening the prunes so the pits
can be removed more easily.  

141
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,181
they must now remove the pits 

142
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,316
before the prunes start to lose moisture     

143
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,120
and become too dry for the job to be done efficiently.    

144
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,791
the prunes speed towards the pitting operation     

145
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,992
and flow into five lanes.   

146
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,329
each one leads to a separate pitting line.  

147
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,665
with five different pitting lines,    

148
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,669
they'll process hundreds of prunes a minute.  

149
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:01,206
clamps close around the prunes,

150
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,409
securing them         
for knives to push out the pits.

151
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:10,549
the pits will be ground up and added to animal feed.    

152
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,084
the pitted prunes make a soft landing      

153
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,619
on a rubber conveyor,     

154
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,955
which takes them into a laser-detection center. 

155
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,757
the laser finds pits or pit fragments        

156
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,694
and relays the information to a computer.         

157
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,830
the computer activates air jets

158
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,766
that blast out the unwanted material.     

159
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,136
it happens so fast, it's all a blur.        

160
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,841
on another shaker conveyor now,

161
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,645
the prunes bounce towards a big drum.      

162
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:43,381
the drum revolves slowly to gently toss the prunes   

163
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,919
as they pump in a preservative,
flavorings, and oil.      

164
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,320
the prunes absorb the ingredients        

165
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:52,724
as they tumble around in the drum.          

166
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,193
at this point,         

167
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:57,796
they sample the moisture content
of the prunes every 15 minutes. 

168
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,466
the technician grinds and compresses some prunes   

169
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:03,134
into a disc.          

170
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,071
she drives an electrode into it
to gauge the moisture.     

171
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,208
it should be between 28% and 32% --         

172
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,911
enough to improve the texture, 
but a lot less than fresh fruit.

173
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:20,185
it's time to wrap things up. sectioning arms open the bags. 

174
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,889
feeders dispense        

175
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,425
a precise amount of pitted prunes into them.  

176
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:30,829
a heated device then melts   

177
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,332
the ends of the plastic bags together to seal them.     

178
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,371
they produce 120 bags of prunes
a minute at this factory,   

179
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,040
so adding fiber to one's diet shouldn't be a problem.    

180
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,658
narrator: if you ride horses regularly, 

181
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,527
chances are you own a pair of spurs.    

182
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,330
spurs strap onto the heels of riding boots.        

183
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,734
each spur has a small wheel, usually spiked,        

184
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,869
with which the rider prods the horse        

185
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,306
to get it to start moving or move faster.        

186
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,278
the anatomy of a spur is elementary.         

187
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,081
the wheel, called the rawl, is mounted in the shank.    

188
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,550
the shank is connected to the heel band.       

189
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,487
the heel band is held to the boot by a leather strap.

190
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,489
the metal parts are made from 

191
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,925
a strong, yet flexible, type of steel.         

192
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,160
a computer-guided laser    

193
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,629
cuts the starting shape for the heel bands.      

194
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:38,696
a quick strike of a press   

195
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,966
stamps them with the company name.     

196
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:44,035
next, workers smooth and bevel the edges,      

197
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,371
using a sander outfitted with a special belt      

198
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,741
for grinding metal.      

199
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:55,313
next, they hammer the piece around a steel block,     

200
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,648
cushioning the blows with a piece of wood      

201
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,117
to avoid marring the surface. 

202
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,987
the block is shaped exactly like
the heel of the boots     

203
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,188
for which the spurs have been ordered,       

204
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,258
ensuring a custom fit.     

205
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,795
they heat evenly with a torch. 

206
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:12,864
this relaxes the steel around the block so that    

207
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:16,401
the heel band permanently registers this shape.     

208
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,069
then, some final taps     

209
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,740
to lay the band completely flat
against the block.       

210
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,575
this perfects the shape.    

211
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,082
they submerge the heel band in cool water.         

212
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:35,320
this tempers the flexible steel,
rendering it hard and stiff.  

213
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,422
then, with a fine-grit belt,  

214
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,692
they sand away any surface imperfections.   

215
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:45,163
a pair of spurs is made up of some two dozen steel pieces,

216
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,433
all of which go through the same prep as the heel band.

217
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:55,640
once all the parts are ready, 
workers precision weld the shank

218
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,143
to the mid-point of the heel band.       

219
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,055
next, to each side of the heel band, 

220
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,457
they weld a pin, which holds a pivoting arm.  

221
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,460
these swingarms, as they're called,       

222
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,431
hold the leather strap that retains the spur to the boot. 

223
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,407
to make the rawls, they trace a template on steel,

224
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,477
then cut along the lines with a metal band saw.     

225
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,281
if the rawl shape is elaborate,

226
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:40,551
a computer-guided laser cuts them out.         

227
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,021
after sanding the rawl thoroughly      

228
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,424
to smooth sharp edges which could cut the horse,   

229
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,860
they mount it to the shank with a stainless-steel pin.  

230
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,367
then they weld the back of the pin.      

231
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,641
now the artistry begins.    

232
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:06,778
a craftsman creates decorative overlays in sterling silver.  

233
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,647
he cuts their shapes with a jeweler's saw,     

234
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,184
draws a design, then, using an array of engraving tools,  

235
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,655
meticulously carves it out.  

236
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,197
he cleans the back of the overlays with flux --  

237
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,534
an acidic chemical -- then coats them with solder.  

238
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,069
the trick is to apply just enough          

239
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,605
to bond the silver to the steel.

240
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:37,809
too much would overflow and ruin the front.      

241
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,413
by the time he gently applies each overlay to the spur,   

242
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,015
the solder has cooled and solidified,        

243
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,219
so he warms the steel with a torch from underneath. 

244
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,888
this reheats and liquefies the solder,          

245
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,290
which then cools and resolidifies,       

246
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,358
bonding the silver to the steel.

247
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,762
the heat causes some discoloration,      

248
00:14:56,764 --> 00:15:00,631
which he easily removes with a bit of flux.      

249
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,502
once all the silver overlays are soldered to the spur,   

250
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,871
workers polish them on a cloth buffing wheel.   

251
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:11,443
the finishing touch -- they submerge the spurs in a tank  

252
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,512
containing a chemical solution called gun bluing.       

253
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,115
it turns the shiny steel parts black.             

254
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,985
to produce an antique brown, rather than black finish,   

255
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,921
workers heat the spurs in an oven,          

256
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:26,525
then apply a chemical which tints the steel.     

257
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,527
now for the leather straps.  

258
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,329
an artisan tools the leather entirely by hand,       

259
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,333
dyes it, attaches a stainless-steel buckle,   

260
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:39,537
then sews tabs on both ends that hook to the swingarms   

261
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,806
on the heel band.       

262
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,710
this shiny set of spurs is ready
for some horsing around.    

263
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,628
narrator: many low-speed vehicles have  
tires made of polyurethane foam,

264
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,031
rather than air-filled rubber tires.    

265
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,900
polyurethane          
doesn't deteriorate in sunlight,

266
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,102
nor does it dry out over time. 

267
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,639
and if the tire is made entirely
of the closed-cell type of foam,

268
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,075
the tire won't go flat.    

269
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,714
polyurethane tires are designed
for low-speed vehicles,    

270
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,850
such as baggage carts and ride-on lawn mowers.    

271
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,786
this particular type of polyurethane foam      

272
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,589
has a closed-cell structure,  

273
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:34,259
which prevents a flat,     
even if the tire gets punctured.

274
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,595
millions of air bubbles encapsulated within the foam  

275
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,932
give it the required bounce factor.  

276
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,067
the first step is to take an aluminum model of the tire 

277
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,204
and make a production mold with it.            

278
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,673
this one's for a forklift.   

279
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,344
the mold will have two halves --
each one lined with a tread ring

280
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:56,815
to prevent the cast tire from getting stuck in the cavity.  

281
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,352
to make each half of the mold, 
they center the model in a base,

282
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,423
then fill the space around it with polyurethane elastomer,  

283
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,692
which is a solid type of polyurethane,        

284
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:12,531
as opposed to the foam type they use to cast the tires.  

285
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:18,403
they stir gently to move air bubbles to the top...   

286
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:23,708
...then heat those bubbles with a small propane torch   

287
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,645
to burst them.         

288
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,580
with the help of a heated table
to speed things along,     

289
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,251
the material solidifies in approximately 15 minutes,  

290
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,221
at which point, they extract the half-mold... 

291
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,327
...and, with the utility knife,
trim its rough edges      

292
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,196
both inside and out.      

293
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,273
then they mate the two halves, 

294
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,743
and the production mold is ready.           

295
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,147
whereas most companies buy foam mixtures ready-made, 

296
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,349
this one blends its own,    

297
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,486
in order to have strict control
over the formulation.     

298
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,889
technicians weigh out the chemical ingredients    

299
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,224
manually with a high-precision industrial scale        

300
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,361
that's accurate to within 1 1/2 ounces.    

301
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,831
a propeller-shaped blade mixes the ingredients     

302
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,434
for half an hour,       

303
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,104
moving everything from top to bottom more than 300 times 

304
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,307
and drawing it out       
of the corners of the container.

305
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,577
this ensures the mixture is evenly blended throughout. 

306
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,782
before using this foam to cast the tires,       

307
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,051
a quality-control test.    

308
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,720
they take a sample from the batch         

309
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:46,524
and let it rise and set, which takes about a minute.  

310
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,531
then they cut a piece of a specific size, weigh it, 

311
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,133
and calculate the density.   

312
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,535
if the sample meets specifications,     

313
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,237
the batch is a go.       

314
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,742
just before filling the two halves of the mold   

315
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,144
with polyurethane foam,    

316
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,080
they lubricate the cavity with a release agent.     

317
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,016
this prevents the tire from sticking to the mold   

318
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,985
when they extract it.     

319
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,990
a press keeps the mold closed and in place          

320
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,958
on the filling machine.    

321
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,627
the machine spins the mold   

322
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,896
while the foam flows into the cavity        

323
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,497
through a hole at the top.   

324
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,168
the spinning creates centrifugal force   

325
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,570
that distributes the foam into every nook and cranny.  

326
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,245
in less than a minute, the foam,
although not yet fully cured, 

327
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:44,382
is solid enough to be extracted.

328
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,519
they open the mold, remove the tread ring,     

329
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,587
then dislodge the cast tire  

330
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,656
with a short blast of an air gun.         

331
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,593
they trim the excess foam from the center.        

332
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,795
it can be ground up to make other products,    

333
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,664
such as floor mats.      

334
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:04,935
here's what the tire looks like before...      

335
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,473
and after trimming.      

336
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:12,477
the polyurethane foam takes 24 more hours to fully cure,  

337
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,413
then the tires are ready to roll.       

338
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:19,751
this company sells tires with and without painted steel rims.

339
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,153
rim installation is simple.  

340
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,757
they place the rim on a base, followed by a mounting cone,  

341
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,025
then the tire.         

342
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,893
a press snaps the center of the tire     

343
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,228
over the edge of the rim.   

344
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,830
besides making the tire flat-resistant,        

345
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:36,234
the closed-cell structure of this polyurethane foam   

346
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,369
doesn't absorb water,     

347
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,506
meaning wet conditions don't hamper performance.   

348
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:45,643
the tire is also u.v. resistant
and withstands high abrasion, 

349
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:48,112
so it typically lasts two to three times longer   

350
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,783
than an air-filled tire used on the same vehicle.
