narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,855
hospitals generate a lot of dirty laundry,    

5
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:59,058
from patient gowns and sheets to cleaning rags.       

6
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,527
some facilities do the washing in house.           

7
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,797
but to free up hospital space, some send theirs out      

8
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,400
to industrial-size laundry operations       

9
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,603
that deal in high-volume with bigger and better equipment.  

10
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,942
the hospital sends all fabric items to the laundry,  

11
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,145
including bed linens, towels, patient gowns,     

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,080
bibs, and cleaning rags.    

13
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,482
the only exception is surgical linens,      

14
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,484
which are usually disposable. 

15
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,687
the laundry company picks up the order       

16
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,821
and delivers it to the plant. 

17
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,558
next, workers unload the bags of soiled laundry       

18
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:34,360
on large rolling carts.    

19
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,829
they weigh each one for internal statistical purposes 

20
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,967
and scan its bar code to track the laundry for each hospital. 

21
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:46,438
workers handling the bags wear gloves at all times.   

22
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,174
the bags are plastic,     

23
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,841
which is more suitable than cloth           

24
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,644
for containing liquid, odor, and bacteria.      

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,646
workers rip each one open and, 

26
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:58,650
without touching the contents, dump them on the conveyor.   

27
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,919
they discard the bag in a suction device      

28
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,522
that sends it to a baling system.      

29
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,459
the bales of bags go to a recycling facility   

30
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,127
that turns them into garbage bags       

31
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,129
and other polyethylene products.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,401
from this point on, everything is automated.    

33
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:20,940
the conveyor drops the soiled 
laundry into a sturdy cloth bag.

34
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,942
once the bag reaches 120 pounds,

35
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,278
the conveyor automatically stops loading.  

36
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,152
the filled bag travels to an overhead conveyor system,

37
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,555
which leads to one of several stainless steel,  

38
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,690
tunnel-shaped washing machines.

39
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:42,028
inside, a large rotating screw pushes the load        

40
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,696
through two pre-soaks,     

41
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,432
then moves on to six chemical wash cycles  

42
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:50,169
designed to remove tough stains
such as blood and iodine.   

43
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:54,106
next are five treatment cycles to soften the fabric      

44
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,842
and normalize the ph level.  

45
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,178
then, three rinses.      

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,782
the load of now clean laundry exits the tunnel washer    

47
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,684
and enters a hydraulic press. 

48
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:10,056
the press applies around 12 tons of weight    

49
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,324
to squeeze out the residual water.      

50
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:20,199
the load comes out compressed into what they call a cake.  

51
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,734
a conveyor transfers it to an elevator,        

52
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,805
which transports it to the drying area.      

53
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,810
the conveyor puts two cakes at a time into the dryer.   

54
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,945
an infrared sensor inside signals         

55
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,015
the dryer to stop when the load is dry,     

56
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:39,284
about 22 minutes later.    

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,686
a revolving paddle called a cake breaker     

58
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,756
separates the stuck-together items    

59
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,291
to prepare them for sorting.  

60
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:49,695
from this point on,      

61
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,965
automation ends and manual sorting begins.   

62
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,501
workers pull different categories of items 

63
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:58,771
and toss them into designated linen hoppers 

64
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,506
that are hooked up to scales. 

65
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,445
when a bag hits the target weight,    

66
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:09,314
it automatically drops down onto a conveyor,  

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,850
which leads to the final processing area. 

68
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,585
here, items are either folded 

69
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:17,256
or bulk packaged in plastic bags.        

70
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,259
workers load the bulk items into a vacuum system,     

71
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,728
which feeds          
into automated bagging machines.

72
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,131
the machines have either a built-in scale,       

73
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,734
which weighs the bag as it fills, or a photo cell, 

74
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,270
which counts the items dropping into the bag.     

75
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,208
once the bag reaches the target weight or count,  

76
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,644
the machine heat-seals and releases it.        

77
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,450
certain items have to be folded.

78
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:51,023
luckily, a machine automatically folds bed pads, 

79
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,359
bath towels, and patient gowns 

80
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,529
by flipping over the ends with short blasts of air.   

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,508
the neatly folded items collect underneath the machine,

82
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,045
then travel by conveyor to the shipping preparation area. 

83
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,781
here, workers stack them onto rolling carts. 

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,987
a different folding machine handles the larger items,   

85
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,457
such as bed sheets and flannel blankets.     

86
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,860
a worker clamps an item to the feeder.         

87
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,530
then, the machine, using rollers and straps,   

88
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,999
processes the item until it's neatly folded.   

89
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,443
the clean laundry goes back onto carts...    

90
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,548
...into the truck, and back to the hospital.   

91
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,099
narrator: life on the concert circuit  

92
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,567
can be punishing, not just for the musicians,  

93
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,503
but also their instruments.  

94
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,838
dents, scuffs, and general wear

95
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,775
can ruin the tone of a brass instrument.     

96
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,911
but with a professional restoration,          

97
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,882
a badly damaged horn can once again shine in the spotlight. 

98
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,323
they may look ready for the scrap heap,      

99
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,724
but incredibly,        

100
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,460
these not-so-gently-used brass instruments       

101
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:38,396
can be salvaged.        

102
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,866
technicians will use a combination of techniques  

103
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,968
to make them look and sound like new.    

104
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:49,208
the restoration work starts with this solid steel ball.  

105
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,611
the technician inserts it in the bore of the saxophone, 

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,147
just under some deep dents.  

107
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,751
he places a plastic sheet on the dents from the outside. 

108
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:01,153
it protects the finish from scratches         

109
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:05,424
as he now moves a powerful magnet over the dents.     

110
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,693
the magnet pulls the ball against the inside       

111
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,828
of the instrument with such force        

112
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,432
that it pushes out the dents. 

113
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,568
after 30 seconds of this magnetic manipulation, 

114
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,370
the dents are completely gone. 

115
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,776
using a series of engraving tools,      

116
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,110
another member of the team   

117
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,380
restores the artwork on the instrument.       

118
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,916
he follows the traces that remain,          

119
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:34,887
and recreates designs that have completely worn away.

120
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,994
he only has one chance to get this right.       

121
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,666
this takes skill and a steady hand.       

122
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:54,072
the next technician reattaches a key cup to the hinge rod,  

123
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,940
and melts solder into the joint

124
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:57,943
to make the connection permanent.           

125
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,882
the brass looks very tarnished,

126
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,419
so he buffs the key cup and rod
to a mirror finish.      

127
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,896
he now attaches the restored key and rod to the saxophone  

128
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,898
and screws it into position.  

129
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,171
he presses the end of the key lever    

130
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,307
to confirm that it moves as it should.  

131
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,245
he now inserts a fluorescent light      

132
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,313
into the body of the saxophone.

133
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,316
it will help him find air leaks.

134
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:44,723
but first, he activates an adhesive with a torch    

135
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,326
and applies it to the back of a leather pad.       

136
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:52,331
he pries an old and deteriorated
pad out of one of the key cups.

137
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:57,503
he transfers the new glue-backed pad to the key cup.

138
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,010
he closes the key against the tone hole,     

139
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,246
and the escaping light indicates a leak.       

140
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,351
so, he heats the pad to reactivate the adhesive,  

141
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,687
and shifts it a bit in the key cup.        

142
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:20,492
now, the key completely closes the tone hole when pressed.  

143
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,094
the next thing to be repaired 

144
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:25,197
is a key guard foot that's broken away from the horn.   

145
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,900
this is delicate work.     

146
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:32,037
to resolder it, the technician uses a hydrogen gas torch   

147
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,573
because its flame is more precise.        

148
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:41,446
at another station, a new part takes shape.    

149
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,715
they carve a brass cylinder to transform it        

150
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,251
into a new spring barrel for a trumpet valve.      

151
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:54,058
he inserts the spring barrel into the top of the piston,  

152
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,828
and the fit is good.      

153
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,599
he then places all the trumpet valve parts  

154
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,202
in a water-and-solvent solution.

155
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,604
he switches on an ultrasonic device,     

156
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:09,407
which sends high frequency sound
waves through the solution.  

157
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,477
microscopic bubbles bombard the parts       

158
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,313
and remove oil and grease.   

159
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,952
the trumpet now chills in a cryogenic freezer     

160
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,354
at minus 301 degrees fahrenheit

161
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,723
to relieve it of residual stresses.     

162
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,961
back to room temperature,   

163
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,096
the technician inserts a tiny camera     

164
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,897
into the bore of the horn.   

165
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,033
it gives him an inside look at the alignment        

166
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,036
of the piston ports as he presses the valves.   

167
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,514
as with any instrument, the proof is in the playing.  

168
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,184
[ saxophone plays ]      

169
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,789
this sax is sure to meet the approval      

170
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,725
of crowds of music lovers.   

171
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,546
narrator: displaying a life-size replica of a horse 

172
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:24,949
makes a galloping statement at a farm, a racetrack,    

173
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,152
or a western-themed venue.   

174
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,289
some horse owners even commission a replica   

175
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,691
in the likeness of their favorite animal.   

176
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,701
a life-size fiberglass horse can be an attraction,     

177
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,636
but before this replica,    

178
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,371
there was an artist's sculpture

179
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,841
in either wood, plaster, or styrofoam.         

180
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,576
the sculpture served as the model      

181
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:56,648
to produce this three-part mold
to cast one or more replicas. 

182
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,182
they apply a release agent,  

183
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,053
so the casting won't stick to the mold.    

184
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:04,056
then they partially brush on and partially spray      

185
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,125
a .4mm-thick layer of gel coat.

186
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,662
gel coat is an easy-to-repair resin-based material      

187
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:15,066
that produces a smooth, shiny finish on fiberglass.  

188
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,470
three hours later, the gel coat is dry.      

189
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,204
next, they apply two layers  

190
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,607
of resin-saturated fiberglass fabric       

191
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,176
in the hard-to-access area of the mold.          

192
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,946
then they roll the fiberglass flat against the mold     

193
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,016
to prevent air bubbles, which would cause defects.   

194
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,420
with a tool called a chopper gun,     

195
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,557
they shoot shredded fiberglass mixed with resin        

196
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,226
over all the other gel-coated areas of the mold. 

197
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,505
they roll out the air bubbles and pack down the fiberglass  

198
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:57,309
to a consistent thickness of 3 millimeters.       

199
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,178
this ensures the hollow horse will be strong enough     

200
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,049
to withstand up to 400 pounds of people sitting on it.    

201
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,519
the resin-filled fiberglass cures             

202
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,989
within approximately two hours.

203
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,857
then they drive in wooden wedges

204
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,260
to pry the casting from the mold         

205
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,130
just enough to grab hold of the edge and pull.     

206
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,832
thanks to the release agent they applied earlier,     

207
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,533
extraction is effortless    

208
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:27,138
and causes no damage to the casting or mold.    

209
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,941
nonetheless, they carefully inspect the surface 

210
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,044
to be sure it's free of defects.

211
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,083
next, they pass a grinder along the perimeter      

212
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,619
to trim off all the excess fiberglass   

213
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,921
and smooth the edge.      

214
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,895
each part of the mold produces half a horse,     

215
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,499
so the next step is      
to join the halves into a whole.

216
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,835
the attachment must be hidden on the inside      

217
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,470
so it doesn't show.      

218
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,775
they first temporarily     
attach the halves on the outside

219
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,912
with galvanized steel brackets 

220
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,182
and straps around the legs.  

221
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,587
then they cut a large opening towards the front of the horse 

222
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,557
to be able to access the inside.

223
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:21,392
they first fill the small space

224
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,461
between the two halves with putty           

225
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,131
that auto body repair shops use on cars.          

226
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,803
then they reinforce the joint with a double layer      

227
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,373
of resin-saturated fiberglass fabric.       

228
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:45,150
they cut a second opening toward the back of the horse, 

229
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,886
to repeat the process on a different area.      

230
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,156
then they close up the openings.

231
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,892
they temporarily hold the cutouts in position    

232
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,827
with galvanized steel brackets 

233
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,762
and fill all around with putty.

234
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,633
the putty and inside strips dry in an hour, at which point 

235
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:05,103
all the brackets can come off. 

236
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,105
now they work on the outside, 

237
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:10,108
sealing the space between the parts with more putty.   

238
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,315
once it dries,         

239
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:20,452
they flatten the seam with an electric sander.    

240
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,654
then they remove marks left by the sander    

241
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,458
by manually using a very fine sandpaper.     

242
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:29,427
the seams are now flush with the rest of the surface. 

243
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,731
once painted, they won't show at all.    

244
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,400
after cleaning the entire horse
with acetone,         

245
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,736
they spray a coat of primer over the puttied seams.    

246
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,605
then, with fine sandpaper,   

247
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,074
they prep the surface to receive automotive paint.  

248
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,812
the horse is ready to be painted.         

249
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,881
with delicate strokes of an airbrush,        

250
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,717
an artist gradually paints the animal to life.   

251
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,231
before finishing her artwork, 

252
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,100
she'll apply two coats of transparent varnish     

253
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,369
to protect the paint from precipitation       

254
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,339
and the fading effect of the sun's rays.       

255
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,385
ts are ground-breaking tools.   

256
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,387
attached to the bottom arm of backhoes          

257
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,122
or other heavy equipment,   

258
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,592
they scoop up tons of soil and rock     

259
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,260
to make holes in the ground.  

260
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,128
for jobs like building foundations   

261
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,263
and laying water and sewer pipes,     

262
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,766
excavation buckets dig right in.

263
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,608
for soil excavation, there's quite a bucket list.  

264
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,611
manufacturers make excavation buckets       

265
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,880
in a range of sizes and profiles.     

266
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,350
they could have teeth or a smooth blade,       

267
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,685
depending on the kind of soil they'll be digging.      

268
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,757
they custom design each excavation bucket     

269
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,560
on a computer and map out the dimensions.  

270
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,632
the computer then guides a plasma torch   

271
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:18,236
as it cuts parts from high-strength steel.   

272
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,839
here, the torch produces attachment plates   

273
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,309
for holding the bucket to the excavator arms.     

274
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,244
it even cuts the holes for the pins     

275
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,079
that will hinge it to a boom arm.         

276
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,719
each part weighs over 200 pounds.    

277
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,588
a powerful magnet       
lifts it over to a metal palette

278
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,757
to await refining.       

279
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,931
next, the computer-guided torch
carves through         

280
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,401
a thinner sheet of steel to produce a template.     

281
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,608
parts of the excavation bucket will be shaped in this template

282
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:59,177
so they'll match up when assembled.        

283
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,352
with an oxygen-fueled torch, they bevel the blade      

284
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,221
to give it the edge it needs to bite into the ground.    

285
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,426
this blade profile is for sandy soil.       

286
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,563
a jagged edge is preferred for rocky or clay terrain.   

287
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:25,369
next, it's over to a powerful press. 

288
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,373
it bends another part into an arch.         

289
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,175
this arched part with straddle the top     

290
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,509
of the excavation bucket.   

291
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,115
meanwhile, at another station, 

292
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,517
a press bears downs on the beveled blade      

293
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,919
to shape it to the template.  

294
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:49,327
the template is a cardboard copy
of the steel one cut earlier. 

295
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,797
the operator confirms that the first bend is angled correctly.

296
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,069
he then sprinkles lubricant and aims the press       

297
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,538
a few centimeters away from the first bend.   

298
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,343
it takes six to eight hits to achieve           

299
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,013
the desired 90-degree angle.  

300
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,684
once satisfied,        

301
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,953
he'll bend the other end to the same degree.      

302
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,098
using rollers, the factory   
transforms a flat piece of steel

303
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,501
into the bottom and back wall of the bucket.  

304
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,173
the operator checks the curvature      

305
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,109
of the part with each pass until it's spot on.      

306
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,913
they're now ready to pull all the pieces     

307
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,783
of the excavation bucket together.           

308
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,655
using chains and a hydraulic system,    

309
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,224
they pull the sides up to meet the back wall.     

310
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,197
the steel template is now put to use.       

311
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,599
it's positioned on the front lower lip,    

312
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,869
and serves as a guide as the chains bend the sides. 

313
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,808
with the sides now flush to the back,     

314
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,076
a welder first tacks them together   

315
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,912
and then does permanent welds. 

316
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,420
he guides the blade      

317
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,090
into position at the front of the bucket   

318
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,493
and welds it to it.      

319
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,094
when this weld is complete,  

320
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,696
he'll remove the steel template.

321
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,301
the attachment plates have by now been linked by thick pins. 

322
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,571
they lower it onto the top of the bucket,         

323
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,908
and it fits snugly to the arch and the to the back wall.   

324
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,277
he welds the attachment assembly
to the bucket.         

325
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,516
they paint the bucket inside and out.        

326
00:20:55,422 --> 00:21:00,591
yellow or black are popular choices for excavation buckets.

327
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,993
clients usually match the color
of the bucket         

328
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,462
to the machine that moves it. 

329
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,004
it takes about 50 hours    

330
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,406
to manufacture an excavation bucket,     

331
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,609
and then it's ready to hit the ground.
