00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,976
casino technicians also use     
it to configure the machine.    
then workers install panels with

it to configure the machine.    
then workers install panels with
slots for receiving tickets and 

394
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,680
then workers install panels with
slots for receiving tickets and 
for inserting either money or   

395
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,684
slots for receiving tickets and 
for inserting either money or   
debit cards.                    

396
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,652
for inserting either money or   
debit cards.                    
and now for the slot machine's

00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,387
debit cards.                    
and now for the slot machine's  
most famous feature -- the      

398
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,322
and now for the slot machine's  
most famous feature -- the      
reels.                          

399
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,923
most famous feature -- the      
reels.                          
after a machine tests the       

400
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,692
reels.                          
after a machine tests the       
spinning motion and lights, a

after a machine tests the       
spinning motion and lights, a   
worker attaches a plastic strip 

402
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,063
spinning motion and lights, a   
worker attaches a plastic strip 
with printed symbols -- 18 to 22

403
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,334
worker attaches a plastic strip 
with printed symbols -- 18 to 22
symbols per reel.               

404
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,935
with printed symbols -- 18 to 22
symbols per reel.               
the reels easily snap into a    

405
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:10,408
symbols per reel.               
the reels easily snap into a    
waiting electrical connection.  

406
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,276
the reels easily snap into a    
waiting electrical connection.  
next comes what's called the    

407
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:12,943
waiting electrical connection.  
next comes what's called the    
top box.                        

408
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,412
next comes what's called the    
top box.                        
workers mount it onto the       

409
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,813
top box.                        
workers mount it onto the       
bulkhead, then install          

410
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:21,552
workers mount it onto the

fluorescent bulbs.              
these will light up the         

412
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:24,289
fluorescent bulbs.              
these will light up the         
eye-catching artwork on the

glass front of the box.

00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,027
eye-catching artwork on the

the software that runs the game

microchip.                      
the software that runs the game 
is installed on a memory card.

the software that runs the game

it randomly determines the

425
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,979
essentially, it's preprogrammed 

426
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,814
to pay out a certain amount at  

427

random intervals over a given   

428
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,851
period of time.                 

429
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,752
but less money, of course, than 

430
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,922
the machine takes in overall.   

431
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,924
before embarking on its spinning

432
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,525
spree, each slot machine        

433
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,727
undergoes extensive

00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,094
quality-control testing.        

435
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,529
casinos demand that these       

436
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,064
one-armed bandits are durable   

437
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,733
and reliable because slots      

438
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,868
generate more than two-thirds of

439

casino revenues.
