00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,853
narrator: the first aluminum boat was launched as a simple skiff 

4
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,856
in the middle of the last century.      

5
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:58,857
fishermen loved the lightweight hull      

6
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,927
because it could be pulled in 
and out of the water more easily

7
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,863
than the wooden boats of the day.          

8
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,066
decades later, aluminum boats have gone high-end,      

9
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,969
but they still have that lightweight appeal.    

10
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,943
since aluminum hulls aren't as heavy as other types,    

11
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:22,147
these boats will go farther on a tank of gas.       

12
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,550
they make them from high-grade aluminum    

13
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,218
that's corrosion-resistant.  

14
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,087
rollers flatten the metal,   

15
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,691
and a blade called a slitter cuts it to length.       

16
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,562
a computer-guided router then makes precise cuts     

17
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,498
to produce parts that will fit together perfectly,  

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,835
like this bracket to reinforce the stern.    

19
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:47,839
they cut the boat's larger components       

20
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,042
with a computerized plasma torch.         

21
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:54,179
it can cut a wider path than the router.        

22
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,783
they transfer the cut parts to a pallet.          

23
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,653
this is the boat's bottom panel.

24
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,125
a long piece of aluminum will be the gunnel,      

25
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,861
which is the upper edge of the hull.          

26
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,063
they bend it around a wooden template    

27
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,833
to give it the correct curvature.     

28
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,475
next, they reinforce the bow with an extra plate of aluminum

29
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,276
to withstand pounding waves.  

30
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,546
they brace the other end with numerous stiffeners    

31
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,682
and screw them into place.   

32
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,151
the screws act as a clamping system,     

33
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,821
until the parts of the boat can be permanently attached.  

34
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,423
a line of caulking helps waterproof the seam   

35
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,826
between the hull and the back of the boat,   

36
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,928
called the transom.      

37
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,700
again,             
screws hold everything together,

38
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:50,903
as the painstaking clamping continues.           

39
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,506
they join the two sides of the bow           

40
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:56,342
and hold the ends together with a vise grip.       

41
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,247
this strip of aluminum will act
as the spine of the bow.    

42
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,383
it's called the brace plate.  

43
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,319
more screws tack it into position.         

44
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:15,393
they attach the sides to the rest of the hull.    

45
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,797
now they drill hundreds of holes
along the seams        

46
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,265
and plug them with rivets.   

47
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,134
they extract the clamping screws

48
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:26,071
and fill their holes with more rivets.       

49
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,709
they install the gunnels on the rim of the hull.     

50
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,346
and now it's time for the tank test.       

51
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:38,451
they lower the boat into a tank 
to confirm that it's watertight.

52
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,822
if they find any leaks in all those rivets,      

53
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,624
they'll make the necessary adjustments.   

54
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,293
they spray foam into the bottoms and sides   

55
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,762
to keep this boat afloat    

56
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,098
in the event that something punctures it.  

57
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,835
and then they rough up the surface          

58
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,604
to allow paint to better adhere.

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,379
they move to the interior   

60
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,982
and install felt on the storage panels     

61
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,284
to give them a more finished look.     

62
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,258
then they lay the carpeting port to starboard.       

63
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,130
next comes the plastic fuel tank.     

64
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,668
all they have to do is connect the fuel-line hoses 

65
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,406
and secure them with a stainless steel collar. 

66
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,209
the dash panel fits onto the front.        

67
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,744
it's pre-wired,        

68
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:43,148
so they simply connect it to the boat's main wiring harness.

69
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,220
next, they apply lubricant to the motor's propeller shaft.

70
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:52,023
this allows the propeller to slide on easily.      

71
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,827
they tighten it with a pneumatic ratchet.   

72
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,499
then they hoist the motor onto the stern         

73
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,434
and bolt it into position.   

74
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,579
with the luxurious interior now complete,         

75
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,115
this metal boat bears very little resemblance    

76
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,085
to its utilitarian predecessors.

77
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,591
this particular model doubles as a fishing boat   

78
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,393
and a pleasure craft.     

79
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,796
and it proves that aluminum boats      

80
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,867
are no longer just a basic form of transportation.

81
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,956
narrator: the alpine horn dates back some 2,000 years  

82
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,425
to the celtic tribes      

83
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:02,027
that inhabited         
the northern slopes of the alps.

84
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,630
traditionally, mountain dwellers blew the horn

85
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,364
to announced daily activities, 

86
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,433
such as round-up time for livestock.         

87
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,637
as modern communications reached those altitudes,    

88
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,372
the horn's role became strictly musical.    

89
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,842
[ alpine horn playing ]    

90
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,715
an alpine horn's sound travels about 5 miles,     

91
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,051
thanks to the instrument's length and shape.       

92
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,522
following a centuries-old tradition,   

93
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,124
the horn maker harvests spruce 

94
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,526
at a specific time in the lunar calendar,     

95
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,763
when tree wood is supposedly most resonant.  

96
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:45,404
once the spruce logs dry out, 
which takes at least nine years,

97
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,040
he saws them into planks.   

98
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,745
then he traces and cuts out the shape     

99
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,813
of the horn's curved bell twice --            

100
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,683
once for each half.      

101
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,752
he measures and marks     
how much wood he must hollow out

102
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,554
with his drill press.     

103
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,228
it's tricky because from top to bottom,  

104
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,962
the bell's inside cavity    

105
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,666
progressively widens and deepens.          

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
next, he runs glue       

107
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:24,776
along the perimeter of both bell halves,      

108
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,846
then joins them with a sheet of newspaper in between    

109
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,715
to prevent a permanent bond.  

110
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,650
he'll have to pry them apart later      

111
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,386
to finalize their shape.    

112
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,523
once dry, he tears off excess newspaper,       

113
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:42,261
traces the circumference of the
bell's top and bottom openings,

114
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,262
then measures and draws the bell's shape   

115
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,031
between those two openings.  

116
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,472
once again, following the lines he drew,  

117
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,341
he cuts out the shape.     

118
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:08,820
to check his work, he uses a series of sizing templates. 

119
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,623
he lines them with charcoal,  

120
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,893
then slips the first template onto its designated position  

121
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,962
at the top of the bell.    

122
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,830
the charcoal marks any wood  

123
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,299
that he still needs to shave off.         

124
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,436
he repeats this procedure with each template,      

125
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,172
working his way down until the bell is rounded   

126
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,375
to the proper external dimensions.      

127
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,713
now for the bell's internal dimensions.      

128
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,449
the horn maker detaches the halves.          

129
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:41,186
he scores a line running the length of the bell half  

130
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,721
on each side.         

131
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,326
this marks the inner-wall thickness he's going to create.

132
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:50,195
using a grinder with a rough grit abrasive,  

133
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,532
he wears away the wood right up to the score lines.  

134
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,135
the holes he made earlier tell him how deep to grind.  

135
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,605
then he switches to a finer grit abrasive    

136
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,875
to grind the walls down another millimeter.      

137
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,078
he checks his work with a measuring gauge,    

138
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,283
then glues the halves together again, this time permanently.  

139
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,420
the horn maker constructs the bell's other section    

140
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:18,323
in halves, as well, rounding them off on a lathe. 

141
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:27,032
he coats them in glue and wraps them in rattan.   

142
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:29,767
the rattan solidifies the structure somewhat     

143
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,604
but is primarily for decoration.

144
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,313
once the glue dries,      

145
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,250
he'll glue aluminum connecting dowels to each section.    

146
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,186
these will enable the musician 

147
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,055
to assemble and disassemble the horn parts.        

148
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:57,262
the bell is truly the alpine horn's showpiece.  

149
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,731
horn makers typically embellish it     

150
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,600
with painted scenes or motifs. 

151
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,269
this horn will boast a colorful bouquet       

152
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:07,639
of traditional swiss flowers. 

153
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,547
fully assembled,        

154
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,417
an alpine horn is between 10 and 13 feet long --     

155
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,654
the length determining the pitch of the instrument.  

156
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,492
musicians use lip movements  

157
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:29,761
to modulate the vibration of the air column inside.   

158
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,231
different vibrations produce different notes.    

159

[ alpine horn playing ]    

160
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,391
narrator: throughout most of the 19th century,   

161
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,261
the wristwatch was a piece of jewelry worn by women.    

162
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,730
men carried pocket watches.  

163
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,132
it was during the boer war in 1899            

164
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,069
that british soldiers decided fumbling around        

165
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,040
for a pocket watch during battle
was a serious waste of time.  

166
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:24,482
the tools of the trade haven't changed much      

167
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,285
since pocket watches ruled the day.         

168
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,021
in this swiss workshop,    

169
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:32,090
the mechanisms are meticulously handcrafted, 

170
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,660
just like they were centuries ago.         

171
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,062
the watchmaker starts     

172
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,899
by polishing parts to a mirror finish.      

173
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,836
he mixes his lavender and almond
oils with a diamond paste.   

174
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:47,372
he extracts a part called the cage        

175
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,308
from its storage solution,   

176
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,508
sets it in the paste,     

177
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,145
and polishes it against a zinc block.     

178
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,156
he brushes the dust off the cage
with a soft piece of wood.   

179
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,460
another watchmaker polishes its edges,      

180
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:12,530
removing tiny bits of material so other parts can fit to it.  

181
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:16,467
the technician attaches gears to the cage.          

182
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,672
these gears are the balance and escape wheels.       

183
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,008
he fixes the gears on tiny rubies         

184
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,610
because they don't wear down easily.        

185
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,814
the second half of the cage completes this mechanism,   

186
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,083
called the tourbillion.    

187
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,686
invented in 1789, these rotating gears in a cage 

188
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:38,023
counteract the effect of gravity
on timekeeping         

189
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,592
for more accurate results.   

190
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,366
the watchmaker now magnifies the assembly   

191
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,702
and projects the image onto a screen         

192
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,904
to confirm that the gears and levers   

193
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,007
are interacting correctly.   

194
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,178
next, he secures a wound-up spring in a barrel. 

195
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,016
this is the main spring that powers the gears of the watch. 

196
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,055
he dips a pin in some grease  

197
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,525
and uses it to lubricate the spring.          

198
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,328
then he caps the mainspring with a cover          

199
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,397
and tamps it down with a special tool.      

200
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,668
he carefully positions the barrel in its slot     

201
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,369
on the main plate.       

202
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,744
the watchmaker now installs another series of gears    

203
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,012
on the main plate.       

204
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,346
they'll transfer power     

205
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,516
from the spring to the tourbillion.      

206
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,295
he attaches the bridge to the gears          

207
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,397
to act as a pivot as they turn.

208
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,839
another spot of grease     

209
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,942
keeps these wheels turning efficiently.      

210
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,381
with the spring barrel and its transmission gears assembled,  

211
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,850
production now reaches a critical moment.       

212
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:15,920
he places the mechanism in a holder          

213
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,924
that makes it easier to install the tourbillion.  

214
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,597
it's a tricky job.       

215
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,400
the cage must be precisely positioned      

216
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,203
for its gears to receive power from the spring.        

217
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,943
he now transfers the mechanism to another holder       

218
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,878
to insert the winding stem.  

219
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,223
next, he engraves the circular pattern onto a bridge plate.  

220
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,260
this high-end finish is called perlage.       

221
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,703
the technician attaches the textured bridge      

222
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,539
to the dial side of the watch. 

223
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,846
he assembles more gears    

224
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,048
and a numbered wheel to the bridge.         

225
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,651
these gears will provide the date information      

226
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,720
for this timepiece.      

227
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,791
another bridge secures the gears
that lead to the date wheel.  

228
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,996
he fastens it with tiny screws.

229
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:35,466
he slides the second date wheel
onto its axle         

230
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,271
and checks the setting mechanism.     

231
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,339
we'll have the up-to-the-minute details  

232
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,376
as this watch gets a beautiful face.     

233
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:05,230
narrator: even in the age of digital and electronic wristwatches,  

234
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:08,900
the mechanical watch has an appeal that's timeless.   

235
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:12,237
some are among the most complex in the world 

236
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:15,106
and can cost in the six-figure range.    

237
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,743
at that price, time is truly a luxury.    

238
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,318
in a factory nestled      
in the scenic swiss countryside,

239
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,522
a highly-skilled team has assembled the inner workings  

240
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,492
of a luxurious tourbillion wristwatch.    

241
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:39,264
now a watchmaker fits the handcrafted face      

242
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,999
onto the mechanisms.      

243
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,134
using a special tool,     

244
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,538
he presses the hands onto an  
axle at the center of the watch.

245
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,675
this enables him to set the time and date.   

246
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,955
the watch will be encased with 18-karat red-gold bezels 

247
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:09,027
sealed against the elements with rubber rings.       

248
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,430
he now fastens the middle casing
to the mechanism,       

249
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:16,501
then completes the installation
of the winding stem and crown. 

250
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,108
the watchmaker lubricates the bridge     

251
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,243
for the auto-winding system,  

252
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:31,048
then engraves a parallel-ribbed
pattern onto it.        

253
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,251
this adds visual interest to the bridge,         

254
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,256
making this luxury watch look good inside and out.   

255
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,197
after the bridge has been set with jewels,   

256
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,200
it's ready to be installed at the center of the watch,  

257
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,003
where its jewels will keep parts
from rubbing against each other,

258
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,539
causing wear and tear.     

259
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,415
an artist now engraves the rotor

260
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,952
that's to be attached to the bridge.         

261
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,821
it's this part that will automatically wind the watch. 

262
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,489
it's a signature piece     

263
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,960
that can reflect        
the customer's individual taste.

264
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,503
this stylish-looking rotor   

265
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,740
is now ready to be secured to the bridge.         

266
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,377
once installed,        

267
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,781
even the slightest movement will
cause this rotor to oscillate, 

268
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,719
and that action winds up the mainspring of the watch.  

269
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,734
the watchmaker now shields   
this timepiece with a glass dome

270
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,338
and then vacuums dust from the next gold bezel.   

271
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,007
he carefully cleans this clear sapphire window   

272
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,209
because even the tiniest speck of dirt            

273
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,846
could cause the watch to fail. 

274
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,950
he snaps the front bezel onto the watch,        

275
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,352
then, using a special device, 

276
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,489
he presses the bezel to secure it.         

277
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,492
this action also squeezes the rubber ring        

278
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,626
between the bezel and the watch

279
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:27,565
to create a waterproof seal.  

280
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,034
this watch will now be water-resistant       

281
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,537
to a depth of nearly 330 feet. 

282
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,709
the back casing screws into place       

283
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:41,045
so it can be removed for maintenance work      

284
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,181
during the life of the watch. 

285
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,650
using a special tool,     

286
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,187
he tightens the casing to just the right tension.   

287
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,258
he then inspects the watch   

288
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,895
to confirm that the rotor moves freely within the case. 

289
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,935
next up is a computer analysis of the mechanism.       

290
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,806
a device holds the watch and simulates wrist movements, 

291
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,809
while the computer evaluates its accuracy.         

292
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,684
[ pinging ]          

293
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,287
that's the sound of a minute repeater,     

294
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,288
which is a feature on some models.        

295
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:29,360
when triggered, it chimes the time.      

296
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,429
and now this watch takes the plunge        

297
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,431
into a container of water.   

298
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,567
if bubbles appear, it would signify a leak.    

299
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,372
but there are none, so this watch is waterproof.  

300
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:46,377
this incredible watch will set you back $150,000.  

301
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:51,449
but it will be an heirloom piece
that stands the test of time. 

302
