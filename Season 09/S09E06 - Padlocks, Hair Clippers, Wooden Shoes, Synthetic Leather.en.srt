then the entire assembly is     
riveted together.               

100
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,516
then the entire assembly is     
riveted together.               
each key is tested to make sure 

101
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:22,487

allowing the barber to cut hair 
at quite a clip.                

122
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:29,187
hairstyles may change, but this 
device is still on the cutting  
edge.                           

123
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,355

00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,327
these days, hair-clipper casings
are made out of heavy-duty      
plastic.                        

126
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,195

129
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:56,681
meanwhile, a robot picks up     
brass contacts and places them  
in fixtures.                    

130
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,549
brass contacts and places them  
in fixtures.                    
a plastic switch is then        

131
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,854
in fixtures.                    
a plastic switch is then        
attached to each contact.       

132
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,589
a plastic switch is then        
attached to each contact.       
a blast of air sends the        

133
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,158
attached to each contact.       
a blast of air sends the        
assembled piece to a bin.       

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,427
a blast of air sends the        
assembled piece to a bin.       
here, a robot slides a plastic  

135
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,162
assembled piece to a bin.       
here, a robot slides a plastic  
spool onto a mandrel, then      

136
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,764
here, a robot slides a plastic  
spool onto a mandrel, then      
anchors copper wire to it.      

137
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,633
spool onto a mandrel, then      
anchors copper wire to it.      
the wire is wound around the    

138
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,635
anchors copper wire to it.      
the wire is wound around the    
spool more than 2,000 times to

140
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,506
spool more than 2,000 times to  
make part of the electric relay 
that will drive the blades.     

141
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,241
make part of the electric relay 
that will drive the blades.     
police keep the wire fed at an  

142
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,910
that will drive the blades.     
police keep the wire fed at an  
even tension.                   

143
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:39,557
next, robots work on the        
clipper's lower casing.         
one installs a blade slide for  

144
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,793
clipper's lower casing.         
one installs a blade slide for  
adjusting the blade, and another

145
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,595
one installs a blade slide for  
adjusting the blade, and another
attaches the lever that controls

146
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,464
adjusting the blade, and another
attaches the lever that controls
that slide.                     

147
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:05,449
an automated screwdriver fastens
everything together.            
the clipper assembly is then on 

148
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,951
everything together.            
the clipper assembly is then on 
its way to have a metal arm     

149
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,154
the clipper assembly is then on 
its way to have a metal arm     
installed.                      

150
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,822
its way to have a metal arm     
installed.                      
this piece will move the cutting

151
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,322
installed.                      
this piece will move the cutting
blade.                          

152
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,790
this piece will move the cutting
blade.                          
and for that, it will need a    

153
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:17,461
blade.                          
and for that, it will need a    
couple of springs.              

154
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,564
and for that, it will need a    
couple of springs.              
next, the switch assembly goes  

155
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:19,997
couple of springs.              
next, the switch assembly goes  
in.                             

156
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,833
next, the switch assembly goes  
in.                             
and then the arm is screwed into

157
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,938
in.                             
and then the arm is screwed into
place.                          

158
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,706
and then the arm is screwed into
place.                          
workers install a screw for     

159
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,143
place.                          
workers install a screw for     
adjusting the power setting.    

160
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,744
workers install a screw for     
adjusting the power setting.    
and now they fit the copper wire

161
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,113
adjusting the power setting.    
and now they fit the copper wire
coil into the lower housing     

162
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,681
and now they fit the copper wire
coil into the lower housing     
where it will drive that metal  

163
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,016
coil into the lower housing     
where it will drive that metal  
arm.                            

164
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:49,727
a power cord is run from the    
switch to the coil.             
and now the clipper's inner     

165
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,197
switch to the coil.             
and now the clipper's inner     
workings are complete.          

166
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,466
and now the clipper's inner     
workings are complete.          
over at another station, a punch

167
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,868
workings are complete.          
over at another station, a punch
press stamps out clipper blades.

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,604
over at another station, a punch
press stamps out clipper blades.
the blades are toothless to     

169
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:04,276
press stamps out clipper blades.
the blades are toothless to     
start.                          

170
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,810
the blades are toothless to     
start.                          
but after a good washing and    

171
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,412
start.                          
but after a good washing and    
heat treatment, they head over  

172
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,013
but after a good washing and    
heat treatment, they head over  
to another station to get some  

173
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,882
heat treatment, they head over  
to another station to get some  
teeth.                          

174
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:21,893
a worker pops a blade into a    
fixture to hold it steady, then 
a jagged cylindrical cutter     

175
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,828
fixture to hold it steady, then 
a jagged cylindrical cutter     
carves the teeth.               

176
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,529
a jagged cylindrical cutter     
carves the teeth.               
coolant keeps the process from  

177
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,264
carves the teeth.               
coolant keeps the process from  
overheating and compromising the

178
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,100
coolant keeps the process from  
overheating and compromising the
integrity of the steel.         

179
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,049
each hair clipper has two       
blades.                         
the first one has cutting teeth 

180
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,784
blades.                         
the first one has cutting teeth 
which moves over the second, a  

181
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,319
the first one has cutting teeth 
which moves over the second, a  
larger, stationary blade that   

182
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,920
which moves over the second, a  
larger, stationary blade that   
ensnares the hairs so that they 

183
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,691
larger, stationary blade that   
ensnares the hairs so that they 
can be cut.                     

184
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,826
ensnares the hairs so that they 
can be cut.                     
next, the company's logo is     

185
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:01,132
can be cut.                     
next, the company's logo is     
printed on to the clipper's lid.

186
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,767
next, the company's logo is     
printed on to the clipper's lid.
and the lid is attached to the  

187
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,402
printed on to the clipper's lid.
and the lid is attached to the  
casing that holds the electrical

188
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:10,541
and the lid is attached to the  
casing that holds the electrical
components.                     

189
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,209
casing that holds the electrical
components.                     
workers mount the blades on the 

190
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,711
components.                     
workers mount the blades on the 
head of the clipper for that    

191
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,615
workers mount the blades on the 
head of the clipper for that    
double-edged cutting action.    

192
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,417
head of the clipper for that    
double-edged cutting action.    
and finally, each clipper is    

193
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,352
double-edged cutting action.    
and finally, each clipper is    
tuned for optimum performance by

spoon bits on either side of it 
copy the tasker's movements,    
gradually carving out the inside

the front of the shoe.          

262
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,567

an ultraviolet-light stabilizer 
is added to provide protection  

314
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,750
an ultraviolet-light stabilizer 
is added to provide protection  
from the sun's rays.

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,744
next, different dyes are poured 
into another tub, following a   
formula for a specific shade.

now a big roll of paper with a  
leather-like texture unwinds    
into the coating machine.

apply it to the paper.          
the vinyl-coated paper then     
travels through an oven.

a second batch of vinyl will    
contain a thickening agent.     

338
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,099
a second batch of vinyl will    
contain a thickening agent.     
that's why they call it "the

it will give the fabric shape   
and structure.                  

342
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:47,157
workers pour this second vinyl  
concoction into the coating     
machine, which rolls it on top  

343
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,129

the heat activates the          
thickening agent causing the    

348
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,504
the heat activates the          
thickening agent causing the    
second layer to expand.

sometimes a pattern is printed  
onto the vinyl to make it look  

357
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,659
sometimes a pattern is printed  
onto the vinyl to make it look

to three million times to see   
how it wears.                   
then there's a stretch test.

how it wears.                   
then there's a stretch test.    
a weight is fastened to a strip 

373
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,992
then there's a stretch test.    
a weight is fastened to a strip

374
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,794
a weight is fastened to a strip 
of synthetic leather.           
the weight pulls the swatch to  

375
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,428
of synthetic leather.           
the weight pulls the swatch to  
double its length, but it

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,264
the weight pulls the swatch to  
double its length, but it       
doesn't tear, which means this  

377
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:05,869
double its length, but it       
doesn't tear, which means this  
fabric has a lot of give.       

378
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:12,309
doesn't tear, which means this

next, a trial by fire.          
to pass this test, the fabric   
must self-extinguish in two     

381
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,883
to pass this test, the fabric

and it does...                  

383
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,620
seconds.

thanks to the flame retardant   
that went into production.      

385
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:35,532
next, a cutting is placed in a

a vacuum mold sucks the fabric  

388
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,842
to its form, proving this sample
