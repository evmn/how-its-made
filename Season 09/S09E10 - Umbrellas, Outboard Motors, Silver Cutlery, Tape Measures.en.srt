narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,159
umbrellas...          

5
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,500
...outboard motors...     

6
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,671
...silver cutlery...      

7
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,845
...and tape measures.     

8
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,121
it provides shelter from the rain,         

9
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,655
protection from the sun,    

10
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,925
and it's a chic fashion accessory.       

11
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,661
the umbrella originated in ancient china        

12
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,063
some 1,700 years ago.     

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,800
since then, it's evolved from the original parasol   

14
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,069
to the modern-day collapsible canopy.      

15
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,543
unlike mass-produced models,  

16
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:22,213
this quality umbrella     
is meticulously crafted by hand.

17
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,016
production begins with a birchwood shaft,    

18
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,620
which an artisan stains to match the umbrella's handle.

19
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,021
he narrows down the shaft   

20
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,391
so it will fit perfectly into the handle.        

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,028
after buffing the handle to a shine,          

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,597
he glues it onto the shaft.  

23
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,703
next, the artisan forms two springs       

24
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,771
from wire made of nickel silver,     

25
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,374
a metal that can withstand extreme tension.        

26
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:58,250
he bends one end of the wire into a triangular shape...   

27
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,853
and hammers it flat to ensure a neat fit.     

28
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,456
he cuts two slots in the shaft,

29
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,127
one at the top and one at the bottom.     

30
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,595
then he pierces each slot,   

31
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,131
creating a hole for the spring to hook into.  

32
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,434
with a bit of stain, he hides the exposed wood.   

33
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,273
for the umbrella to open and close easily,   

34
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,874
the springs must fit snugly,  

35
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,810
so the end of the spring gets a right-angle bend.    

36
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,480
this shape sets the correct tension.   

37
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,419
with a tap of the hammer,   

38
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,089
the springs now rest firmly into the slot.         

39
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,026
after trimming the spring,   

40
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,296
the artisan forms it into the perfect shape     

41
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:48,567
by purposely overbending, then correcting the position. 

42
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,902
a small pin inside the shaft  

43
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,506
prevents the spring from opening fully.      

44
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,375
this brass runner is what you slide up the shaft 

45
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,844
to open the umbrella.     

46
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,248
a stop pin limits the runner's travel,  

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,584
preventing the canopy from blowing inside out.    

48
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,856
the artisan fits a length of tying wire         

49
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,391
around the slot in the runner, 

50
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:16,327
then threads the canopy's eight ribs onto it.      

51
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,129
the ribs are made of a type of steel       

52
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,897
that's strong, yet flexible,  

53
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,868
so they curve into a dome shape
when the umbrella's open,   

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,304
then straighten out again when it's closed.       

55
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,612
the ribs' other ends are wired to what's called a notch.   

56
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,784
once they're in place, they'll 
rest just below the handle line.

57
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,488
at the spot where the notch will sit on the shaft,     

58
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,823
a hole is drilled.       

59
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,526
this will hold the pinning wire
in place.           

60
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,765
workers cut eight triangular-shaped panels    

61
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,100
called gores from durable nylon.

62
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,902
they attach a label,      

63
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,440
then assemble the canopy by  
sewing all eight gores together.

64
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,179
next, eight metal tips are inserted into a machine  

65
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,715
that wraps them in fabric.   

66
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,485
then they're stitched to eight locations inside the canopy.  

67
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,326
these smaller pieces of fabric,
called prevents,        

68
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,162
stop the canopy from chaffing against the frame.       

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,533
this decorative rosette hides the point        

70
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,602
at which the runner and ribs meet.             

71
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,072
next, the canopy is draped over the shaft         

72
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,375
and hand-sewn tightly over the notch.    

73
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:43,348
a tip is attached over the end of each rib.   

74
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,917
then each rib is aligned with a canopy seam.      

75
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,959
after checking the fabric for imperfections,       

76
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,027
a worker secures the ribs in position          

77
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,263
by sewing them to their respective seams.   

78
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,702
they roll up the umbrella   

79
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,905
to check that the fastening  
button and band attached earlier

80
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:09,640
are in the right place.    

81
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,378
a decorative ring goes over the notch.      

82
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,251
then the top of the shaft is crowned with a ferrule --  

83
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,588
a brass cap with a protective steel tip.  

84
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,660
this company embellishes its shaft with a steel-plated band,

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,297
ideal for engraving the owner's initials.     

86
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,335
after a quick wash,      

87
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,006
the canopy is ironed for a neat, crisp finish.   

88
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,341
the final touch is a matching cover      

89
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,810
which you can slide off in an instant         

90
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,146
if you're caught in a sudden shower.      

91
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:56,021
when we return, an inside look at the outboard motor.     

92
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,426
narrator: outboard marine motors     

93
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,095
come in a variety of sizes and horsepowers,   

94
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,298
ranging from single-cylinder models  

95
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,766
to powerful eight-cylinder configurations. 

96
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,837
they can run on gas, diesel, or electricity,        

97
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,906
and they can provide power for a quiet day of fishing   

98
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,509
or an exhilarating offshore drag race.      

99
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,916
outboard motors have an engine on top and a gear case below.  

100
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,319
this aluminum engine block is the skeleton        

101
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,987
that houses the cylinders --  

102
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,857
the heart of the engine's internal-combustion system.  

103
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,125
under a stream of cutting fluid,

104
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,596
machines hone the cylinders to precise dimensions.     

105
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,732
miniscule x's are carved into the steel         

106
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,467
that lines the cylinder walls. 

107
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,469
oil will settle into these x's,

108
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,105
keeping the walls well-lubricated for the piston.

109
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,477
workers assemble each piston manually.     

110
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,512
first they build a ridged bearing        

111
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,949
and insert it into the loop at the end of a connecting rod.

112
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,818
then they fit the rod into a pistonhead,       

113
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,354
securing it with a pin.    

114
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,663
the pistons are placed in the cylinders.       

115
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,968
then they lower the engine's crankshaft into place     

116
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,303
and attach it to the loops   

117
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,572
at the ends of the connecting rods.    

118
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,812
the crankshaft's bearings are lubricated and capped off. 

119
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,852
then this part of the engine is
sealed with an aluminum cover. 

120
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,721
to get the cover's positioning just right,          

121
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,390
the first bolt is driven into place manually.      

122
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,194
a precision torque wrench does the rest.         

123
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,032
now the top is screwed on.   

124
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,674
a magneto system is mounted onto the crankshaft.

125
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,276
as it spins, it generates electricity    

126
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,912
for the engine's electronics and pumps.           

127
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,218
meanwhile, on another assembly line,   

128
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,953
the gear case takes shape.   

129
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,755
this machine locks the case's forward gear          

130
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,025
to a shaft that'll turn the motor's propeller.     

131
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,828
the propeller shaft connects the lower driveshaft. 

132
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,232
the factory buys these pieces readymade from a supplier   

133
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,635
but still has to refine the dimensions         

134
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,237
so that everything fits together perfectly.    

135
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,574
this machine analyzes the shaft.

136
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,176
it concludes that this one   

137
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,778
needs to be a fraction of an inch longer,       

138
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,848
so workers add the required number of steel disks     

139
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,584
called shims.         

140
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,187
they insert this driveshaft into the gear case,      

141
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,191
then attach the propeller shaft
with the forward gear.     

142
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,663
now the gear case is linked to the driveshaft,  

143
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,732
which connects to the propeller shaft,    

144
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,500
which turns the propeller.   

145
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,671
the next piece to go into place

146
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,139
is the middle section of the motor --        

147
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,276
the part in between the engine and the gear case. 

148
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,679
first, workers attach the gear case --        

149
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,548
now fitted with a shift rod for switching gears --     

150
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,083
and an upper driveshaft    

151
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:16,154
which transfers power from the engine to the propeller.  

152
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,689
next, the unit gets a coat of paint      

153
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,525
that's salt-water resistant.  

154
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,765
when the paint's dry,     

155
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,969
workers bolt the engine on top of the assembly.    

156
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,505
the engine is plugged into a master computer       

157
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,174
which automatically uploads an operating system      

158
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,443
onto the engine's internal computer.       

159
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,978
then, using a scanner,     

160
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,448
they input information about each cylinder.      

161
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,117
the motor is now fully operational.       

162
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,326
workers insert a propeller onto the propeller shaft,    

163
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,795
then lower the motor into a test tank.       

164
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,535
this factory tests every motor it produces.    

165
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,337
they run the engine for about 10 minutes      

166
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,574
while a computer analyzes the performance data.     

167
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,816
after drying the engine thoroughly,          

168
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,152
workers apply the finishing touches,     

169
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,154
starting with the two-part cover

170
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,790
that encases the lower portion of the motor.         

171
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,233
then they latch another cover over the engine...       

172
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,172
...and stick on decals.    

173
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,042
both covers are made of heavy-duty plastic     

174
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,177
coated in paint that won't fade,

175
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,181
even after a lifetime of sun, wind, and water.    

176
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,255
up next, turning out the silverware   

177
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,926
that turns an ordinary dinner into something special.    

178
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,132
narrator: cutlery dates back to 
the stone age 300,000 years ago.

179
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,335
prehistoric people made the first cutlery     

180
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,605
from splinters of stone, shells, horn, and wood chips. 

181
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,207
during the bronze age,     

182
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,277
humans found a better material -- metal.  

183
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,847
forks came along much later, originating in ancient greece. 

184
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,421
whether cutlery is sterling silver,      

185
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,757
silver-plated, or stainless steel,      

186
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,494
the production process is the same.          

187
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,731
it all starts with thin sheets of metal.   

188
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,301
as workers manually feed the sheet through a press,   

189
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,573
a die inside punches out utensil shapes called blanks. 

190
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,710
fork blanks go into a piercing tool        

191
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,379
which slices away three strips of metal.     

192
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,916
this creates four prongs    

193
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,252
with a support bar across the top -- for now.   

194
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,655
meanwhile, spoon blanks go into a machine       

195
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,657
called the cross roller,    

196
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,859
which expands the spoon head sideways,    

197
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,328
thinning out the metal at the same time.       

198
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,797
then it's into a clipping tool 

199
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,799
which trims the spoon head   

200
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,068
to precisely the right size and shape.           

201
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,875
both spoon and fork blanks now go into a grinding machine 

202
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,877
that smoothes away rough edges 

203
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,081
by vibrating them against small plastic cones.      

204
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,483
elsewhere in the factory,   

205
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,753
a specialized tradesman sculpts the steel die     

206
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,889
that will stamp the pattern on the cutlery handles.    

207
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,758
working from a designer's illustration,   

208
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,961
he has to interpret the pattern
in three dimensions.      

209
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,963
this requires tremendous skill 

210
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,967
because the depth of the design
varies throughout the handle. 

211
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,636
he measures these minute variations    

212
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,705
with a tool called a micrometer.

213
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,246
in the press, the die does three things --  

214
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,115
emboss the pattern, gently bend the handle,    

215
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,453
and mark the back of the utensil
with the manufacturer's name. 

216
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,325
now back to the head of the utensils.        

217
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,660
the forks go into a press   

218
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,130
that bends the prongs to the right curve.      

219
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,066
now that support bar can finally come off.     

220
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,072
spoons, meanwhile,       

221
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,008
go into a press fitted with what's called a bowling die.  

222
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,978
it strikes the spoon's flat head
into a bowl shape.       

223
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,621
every time you strike metal, it hardens a bit.       

224
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,224
so repeatedly during the shaping process,  

225
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:50,428
workers have to heat the blanks
to soften them again.     

226
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,031
making knives is more complicated      

227
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,899
than making spoons and forks. 

228
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,036
each knife handle is constructed from two halves.

229
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,372
a press punches them out and stamps the pattern.     

230
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,706
then a clipping machine    

231
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,009
removes excess metal around the perimeter.     

232
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,983
now workers coat the edge with flux, a chemical cleanser.

233
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,053
the surfaces have to be spotless
to bond properly.       

234
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,461
the two halves are wrapped together with string.     

235
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,000
then powdered metal is poured into the cavity.   

236
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,936
it immediately sticks to the flux on the edges.   

237
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,072
the excess is discarded.    

238
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,408
then the handles are run through
a mini furnace for 12 minutes. 

239
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,812
the 1,600-degree heat liquifies the metal powder,  

240
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,214
soldering the two halves together            

241
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,015
and burning off the string.  

242
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,254
after polishing, the solder line
will be invisible.       

243
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,297
workers pour cement into the center of a centrifuge machine 

244
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,866
and load the hollow handles all around.          

245
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,236
as the machine spins,     

246
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,606
it fills each handle with cement.          

247
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,045
now each handle gets a stainless-steel blade. 

248
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:19,450
the blade's stem goes directly into the wet cement...     

249
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,452
and a clamp holds the parts together            

250
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,488
during the hardening process. 

251
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,262
a 12-minute bath in hot water cures the cement,       

252
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,098
making the handle/blade connection rock-solid     

253
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,767
and giving the handle weight. 

254
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,871
for worker safety,       

255
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,940
it's only now, near the end of production,  

256
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,909
that they sharpen the blades. 

257
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,482
a good polishing        

258
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,551
and this elegant silverware is ready            

259
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,853
for even the most sophisticated
dinner party.         

260
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,231
coming up, a factory that goes the whole nine yards.

261
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,171
narrator: a popular tool in any utility closet,     

262
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,574
the spring-driven, retractable tape measure    

263
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,310
was invented in the middle of the 19th century.      

264
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,314
but it didn't really become popular until the 1940s.    

265
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,485
today, any handyman without one
just doesn't measure up.    

266
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,928
measuring tapes take the guesswork out of any job, 

267
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,328
and if you don't use one,   

268
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,598
you'll soon see the error of your ways.         

269
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,001
production begins       

270
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,670
with a three-dimensional computer design.        

271
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,338
to bring that vision to life, 

272
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,075
a machine first pulls hardened strips of steel --  

273
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,609
five at a time --       

274
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,946
across a network of rollers that coat them with primer.  

275
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,815
then comes the paint.     

276
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,890
after the paint dries,     

277
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,360
the strips are rewound in preparation for printing.  

278
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,029
printing cylinders roll the measurement markings 

279
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,765
onto the steel strips.     

280
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,170
they use black ink for millimeters        

281
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,638
and red for meters.      

282
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,917
next, they heat the measuring tape.      

283
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,718
this ensures          

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,522
that the protective plastic film
applied by this machine    

285
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,724
will stick well to the steel. 

286
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,565
rollers then give the tape a concave contour       

287
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,468
so that it can be extended rigidly.            

288
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,739
every few seconds, the presses grind to a halt  

289
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,742
and a blade cuts the tape to the correct length.     

290
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,212
at the same time, it punches a hole for the end hook,    

291
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,915
which is then riveted into place.          

292
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,353
another machine rolls up steel to make springs.        

293
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,624
the spring enables the measuring
tape to retract into the casing.

294
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,104
the end of the spring is clipped
to an automatic-winding machine.

295
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,308
a worker places the lower half of the tape measure's casing  

296
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,508
into position.         

297
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,444
the machine then rewinds the steel spring        

298
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,848
and transfers it into the casing.        

299
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,987
the spring gets a little lubricating oil.   

300
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,790
then workers install the control breaks,       

301
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,259
which can be used to lock and unroll tape in place.   

302
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,064
assembling the rest of the casing is a snap.    

303
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,266
everything is screwed together.

304
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,639
the measuring tape is attached to the spring.   

305
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,944
and then it's time to test that spring action.      

306
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,949
this factory makes some longer measuring tapes  

307
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,953
from glass fibers, which are far lighter than steel.    

308
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,488
multiple strands of glass   

309
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,224
are pulled through a tub of white liquid plastic     

310
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,926
so that they'll stick together.

311
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,897
the fibers then enter a machine

312
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,033
that coats them with more plastic       

313
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,069
melted down from hard pellets like these.          

314
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,043
this process transforms the glass fibers        

315
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,912
into a strong yet flexible tape,

316
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:44,348
the type commonly used for surveyors' tape measures. 

317
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,586
a computerized printer     

318
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:52,456
transfers measurements to the tape a meter a second. 

319
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,992
lights illuminate the tape   

320
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,695
so a camera can check for printing defects.     

321
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,733
an inspector double-checks the print job         

322
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,936
and also examines each tape for accuracy.         

323
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,205
some tapes are more accurate than others 

324
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,607
because of varying standards  

325
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,876
in different industries and different countries.    

326
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,878
she grades each tape and marks it          

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,548
so that it can be tracked back to the operator.     

328
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,886
a laser then moves over the tapes      

329
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,956
to check the accuracy level again.             

330
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,890
if the reading is off     

331
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,892
by even a few thousandths of a millimeter,        

332
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,295
then the tape is rejected.   

333
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,838
winding a surveyor's tape is a manual job.        

334
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,439
no spring system here,     

335
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,577
because that would make the tape
measure too heavy and unwieldy. 

336
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,515
after winding, the tape is cut 

337
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,818
and the end hook is fastened into place.    

338
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:03,094
and finally, these measuring tapes are ready to roll.
