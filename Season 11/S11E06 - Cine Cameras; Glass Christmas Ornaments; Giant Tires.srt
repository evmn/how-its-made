      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,119
     narrator: a cinecamera     
 is the type of camera they use 

4
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,587
   for making motion pictures.  

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,524
   it captures what it shoots   
  on 16- or 35-millimeter film. 

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,193
          running like          
      a well-oiled machine,     

7
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,397
    its intricate components    
  work with ultimate precision, 

8
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,069
  all inside a powerful marvel  
of technology and craftsmanship.

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,475
     the internal mechanics     
 and electronics of a cinecamera

10
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:20,812
      perform an impressive     
 choreography to capture images.

11
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,548
    to make the main housing,   

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,683
      a computer-controlled     
         milling machine        

13
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,219
       cuts precise spaces      
     in a block of aluminum.    

14
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,623
      then a probe scans it     
    so a computer can verify    

15
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,360
         the shape meets        
   engineering specifications.  

16
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,097
         next, a variety        
    of computer-guided drills   

17
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,566
           and cutters          
     shape the film gate --     

18
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,002
    the component that holds    
     the film for exposure.     

19
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,776
   a grinding wheel completes   
   this highly precise task.    

20
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,713
     they buff the film gate    
       on a rotating drum,      

21
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,783
   infused with diamond powder  
    and a polishing compound.   

22
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,253
    next, workers apply glue    
       to the film guide,       

23
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:05,190
      which pushes the film     
       into the film gate.      

24
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,659
       then they put glue       
      on the film movement,     

25
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,928
  mate the guide and movement,  

26
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,131
      then drive in screws      
      to secure the bond.       

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,135
   these two registration pins  
     hold the film in place.    

28
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,937
   now for the pulldown claws.  

29
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,540
          workers mount         
     these aluminum devices     

30
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,542
   inside the film movement --  
        one on each side.       

31
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,545
 they move forward and downward 

32
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,080
    as the registration pins    
            retract,            

33
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,650
        dragging the film       
        along the guide.        

34
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,355
as the claws pull the film down,
         the pins enter.        

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:42,961
 this exposure repeats at a rate
    of 150 frames per second.   

36
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,030
 next, workers screw on a cover 

37
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,765
           to protect           
  the movement's fragile parts. 

38
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,903
          another cover         
     fits on the other side.    

39
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:02,514
        workers then test       
      each of the buttons.      

40
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,250
         now they attach        
    the camera's drive shaft.   

41
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,586
  the motor drives the movement 
      using a toothed belt.     

42
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,789
   a mechanics test comes next  

43
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:15,027
  to ensure the claws and pins  
     perform with precision.    

44
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,667
     this part of the camera    
         is the shutter.        

45
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,303
         it sits between        
       the film and lens.       

46
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,973
     workers mount a mirror     
     over half the shutter.     

47
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,277
  the mirror reflects the image 
       into the viewfinder      

48
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,948
       when it rotates in       
        behind the lens.        

49
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,685
 a dab of special cleaning fluid
   yields a pristine surface.   

50
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,956
     any dirt on the mirror     
   would create a fuzzy image.  

51
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:50,095
   the protective cover plates  
 will shield existing openings. 

52
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:54,166
   here the shutter and mirror  
         spin in unison.        

53
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,968
         in this model,         
   the shutter is electronic,   

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,171
 so it requires a tiny microchip

55
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,307
      and electrical wires      
     with plugs on the ends.    

56
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,444
technicians scrutinize the parts
        and connections.        

57
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,980
         then they test         
      the electronics again     

58
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:10,882
to ensure everything is working,
   starting with the shutter.   

59
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,655
with all the internal components
            complete,           

60
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,857
    it's time to install them   
    in the camera's housing.    

61
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,928
  the film gate we saw earlier  
      snaps into position.      

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,998
        next, technicians       
 carefully mount the film guide 

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,069
        behind the film,        
     then fasten it tightly.    

64
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:38,043
 last but not least, the shutter
  gently slides into position.  

65
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,949
     they close up one side     
  of the housing with the cover 

66
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,684
           to protect           
    the circuit board inside.   

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,287
        workers then lay        
     an accessory controller    

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,057
           gently into          
    the camera's side cover.    

69
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,628
        it takes tweezers       
        and a steady hand       

70
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,030
 to insert this focusing screen 

71
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:03,634
     through the lens mount     
  at the front of the housing.  

72
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,272
     finally, the lens takes    
   its place front and center.  

73
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,512
    with the camera structure   
          now complete,         

74
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:17,049
    workers attach a magazine   
      containing the film.      

75
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,319
  a little nudge here and there 

76
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,789
         leads the film         
      down the right path.      

77
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,790
   the movement swings forward  

78
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,459
       to allow the film        
       to run its course.       

79
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,728
   with the touch of a button,  

80
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,465
      the film successfully     
races through a mechanical maze.

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,469
this camera excels at high-speed
      and special effects.      

82
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,506
all it needs now is some action.

83
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,750
            narrator:           
        it's hard to beat       

84
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,885
      the glitter and glow      
  of glass christmas ornaments. 

85
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,820
        for many people,        
       the christmas tree       

86
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,823
    just wouldn't be the same   
          without them.         

87
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:00,358
       they were invented       
       in the 19th century      

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,361
     by a german glassmaker     
    who decided to improvise    

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,297
   because he couldn't afford   
      to decorate his tree      

90
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,700
 with the usual nuts and candy. 

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,307
  they're christmas eye candy.  

92
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,178
     today's glass ornaments    
       are a visual treat.      

93
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,180
 to make some of the ornaments, 

94
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,851
    they start with a sketch    
 and make a plaster model of it.

95
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,121
           they use it          
to create a two-part metal mold.

96
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,726
   they take a glass cylinder   
     and fire its wider end     

97
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,230
         so it softens.         

98
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,069
         the glassmaker         
     blows into the pipe end    

99
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,805
   to stretch the supple glass  

100
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,708
      into the basic shape      
      of a bauble ornament.     

101
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,650
        other glass tubes       
 are more bulbous at the center,

102
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,952
     and that's the section     
          that's fired          

103
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,890
   as the glassmaker blows it   
  into a more elongated bubble. 

104
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:11,563
    he places that bubble in    
 the mold and blows extra hard. 

105
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,098
        the glass expands       
        into its crevices       

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,368
     and takes its shape --     
           a snowman.           

107
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,108
          he burns off          
    one of the blowpipe ends    

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,478
 and then aims the torch at the 
 snowman's nose to pull it out. 

109
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,583
        a quick cooldown        
  could shatter this ornament,  

110
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,053
         so he gradually        
     lowers its temperature     

111
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,255
   with a less-intense flame.   

112
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,192
       blowing and molding      
 glass figurines is quick work. 

113
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,929
  the glassmaker has just a few 
   seconds to complete the job  

114
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:50,201
    before the glass becomes    
  too cool and stiff to shape.  

115
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:55,206
     the ornaments now head     
down the line to get some shine.

116
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,409
   this will be an inside job.  

117
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,679
         the glassmaker         
    pours silvering solution    

118
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,947
        into the baubles        
        through the stem.       

119
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,216
    she then dips the bauble    
         in warm water.         

120
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,487
         this activates         
    the silvering chemicals,    

121
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:13,491
    and shaking the ornament    
    accelerates this process.   

122
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,428
           she swirls           
   the silvering liquid around  

123
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,496
       to completely coat       
   the inside of the ornament.  

124
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,499
  a final dip gives this bauble 
         a mirror finish        

125
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,468
      from the inside out.      

126
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,908
           she empties          
     the silvering solution     

127
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,043
        into another tank       
         for recycling.         

128
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,983
  they also use this technique  
        on the figurines,       

129
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,251
        like the snowman.       

130
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,021
  a quick shake gives this guy  
        an inner beauty.        

131
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,999
       next, they submerge      
  the glass ornament in lacquer 

132
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,034
     to give it some color.     

133
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,408
    the mirror finish inside    
   shines through the lacquer.  

134
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:11,349
    now the snowman ornament    
    gets an artist's touch.     

135
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,752
  she airbrushes white lacquer  
        onto the figurine       

136
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,488
      for a frosty finish.      

137
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,191
      it makes the snowman      
   look more like old frosty.   

138
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,697
        the artist paints       
  some of the details by hand,  

139
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,634
    like the trim on the hat    
and robe of this santa ornament.

140
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,604
this gives it more visual depth.

141
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,442
      once the paint dries,     

142
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,844
 she brushes glue onto sections 

143
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,948
  where she wants glitter dust  
            to stick.           

144
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,923
     the glue dries quickly,    
   so the artist applies more.  

145
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,259
          when it comes         
      to christmas sparkle,     

146
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,994
   you just can't get enough.   

147
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,868
   next, she makes an incision  
  in the stem and snaps it off. 

148
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,210
           a metal cap          
   fits on the ornament stub.   

149
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:19,217
      time to pack up these     
fragile beauties very carefully.

150
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,754
  they put them in boxes that   
  cradle each one individually  

151
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,156
  to ensure they arrive safely. 

152
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,359
    now these glass ornaments   
 are ready to go "out on a limb"

153
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,496
 to add beauty to the holidays. 

154
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,850
narrator: tires for construction
      and mining equipment      

155
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,518
     are truly giant-sized.     

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,187
  they can be twice the height  
        of a human being        

157
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,856
 and weigh thousands of pounds. 

158
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,860
   these giant tires also come  
     with a hefty price tag.    

159
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,997
     just one can cost more     
  than an average family sedan. 

160
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,805
      giant tires are made      
      to carry heavy loads      

161
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,207
          in conditions         
  that are seriously off-road,  

162
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,077
           like mining          
     and construction sites.    

163
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,214
      to make giant tires,      

164
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,151
        they feed rubber        
     into a powerful mixer.     

165
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,758
        they add sulfur         
        and antioxidants        

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,827
            to boost            
    the rubber's durability,    

167
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,297
       as well as recycle       
      pieces of used tires.     

168
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,899
    at the top of the mixer,    

169
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,568
      they add carbon black     
      in measured amounts.      

170
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,505
   it's an oil by-product that  
 helps bind everything together.

171
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,978
   the mixing generates heat,   
   which softens the rubber,    

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,447
        making it doughy.       

173
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,384
        the rubber dough        
   then falls between rollers   

174
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,987
  that squeeze it into a sheet. 

175
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,356
 the process is called milling. 

176
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,258
  they slice the sheeted rubber 

177
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,394
        and feed it back        
 into the machine several times.

178
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,531
      this repeated milling     
  essentially kneads the rubber 

179
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,667
           to give it           
     the right consistency.     

180
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,539
         once the rubber        
has been sufficiently processed,

181
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,608
   they feed it to a conveyor.  

182
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,478
  a wheel rolls over the rubber 
       to impress the date      

183
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,681
    and identification number   
            onto it.            

184
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,219
  the rubber then winds through 
     a tank of soapy water.     

185
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,888
          as it exits,          

186
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,490
      it falls over hangers     
  that move it through a dryer. 

187
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,426
    a soapy residue remains,    

188
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,094
       keeping the layers       
     from sticking together     

189
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,298
 as they await more processing. 

190
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,835
   they write the i.d. number   
   on a sample of the rubber    

191
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,705
   and tag the production run   
      with the same number.     

192
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,908
         this signifies         
   that testing is under way.   

193
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,317
    they tuck the test sample   
          in a canister         

194
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,519
     and send it up a chute     
           to the lab.          

195
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,856
 once it's confirmed the rubber 
 has the right characteristics, 

196
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,592
      it's ready to be made     
   into the various components  

197
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,561
        of a giant tire.        

198
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,400
      at the next station,      

199
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:27,204
     dozens of steel cords      
     unwind into a machine.     

200
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,941
        each cord is made       
   of numerous steel threads,   

201
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,478
and each thread is brass-plated.

202
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,117
 these steel cords will be used 
to fortify the processed rubber.

203
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,555
    the cords enter a machine   
       called an extruder.      

204
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,491
       it grinds and heats      
  some of the processed rubber  

205
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,095
    and then forces it around   
 the steel cords to encase them.

206
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,733
   the result is what's known   
     as steel-belted rubber.    

207
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,641
     they cut several of the    
 steel-belted strips on an angle

208
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,978
     and fuse them together.    

209
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,114
     this exposes steel cord    
        around the edges,       

210
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,951
         so hot rollers         
     seal them with rubber.     

211
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,925
     the steel-belted rubber    

212
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,728
       will make the tires      
  more resistant to punctures.  

213
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,532
          but they make         
   the tires' basic structure   

214
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,067
 from rubber-coated nylon cord. 

215
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,005
  they cut the nylon-rubber ply 
      to a specific length.     

216
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,677
       workers then piece       
several of these sheets together

217
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,744
         to form a loop.        

218
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:44,148
        the pieces adhere       
     because uncured rubber     

219
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,817
       is naturally tacky.      

220
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,854
  and a machine rolls the loop  
      to the correct size.      

221
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,825
         they layer more        
     of the nylon-rubber ply    

222
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,896
     in a crisscross fashion    
        to add strength.        

223
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,768
           the machine          
    that helps size the loop    

224
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,503
          also applies          
 a thin layer of ordinary rubber

225
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,374
between each crisscrossed layer.

226
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,376
 this thickens the rubber loop. 

227
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,580
        the finished loop       
       is called the band.      

228
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,317
       it's the skeleton        
       of the giant tire.       

229
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,121
    they hoist it onto a cart   

230
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,758
           and move it          
      to the next station.      

231
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:33,731
    stay tuned, as they shape   
 and inflate this band of rubber

232
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,434
  to turn it into a giant tire. 

233
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,748
            narrator:           
     when it comes to tires,    
   it takes time to supersize.  

234
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,818
       making a giant tire      
   can take 24 hours or more,   

235
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,954
    mainly because the rubber   
     needs a lot of curing.     

236
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,158
    it's not mass production.   
    it's<i> massive</i> production.    

237
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,559
          as a result,          

238
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,196
     factories only produce     
a few of the largest ones a day.

239
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,838
this machine is about to stretch
     the big band of rubber     

240
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,340
        like an elastic.        

241
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,180
       the machine pivots,      

242
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,049
      and its many rollers      
         expand and turn        

243
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,718
      to transfer the band      
      to a spinning drum.       

244
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,855
      the machine pumps air     
  around the protruding rollers 

245
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,656
  to make the transfer easier,  

246
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,992
      while the drum turns      
      at a constant speed       

247
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,394
       to aid the process.      

248
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,401
 once the transfer is complete, 

249
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,804
      the rollers retract,      
      and the air escapes.      

250
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:51,109
this causes the rubber to shrink
to the drum and take its shape. 

251
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:00,485
      they fold the overlap     
  into the center of the drum.  

252
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:08,159
  the giant rubber band now has 
  the basic contour of a tire.  

253
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,693
      next, another machine     

254
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,363
   coats numerous steel wires   
          with rubber,          

255
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,965
         creating strips        
      of rubberized steel.      

256
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,568
        this will be used       
       to make the bead --      

257
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,705
      the part of the tire      
   that sits on the wheel rim.  

258
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,311
 they wind the rubberized steel 
      around a metal wheel      

259
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,348
up to 20 times to form the bead.

260
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,524
      they remove the bead      
         and inspect it.        

261
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,528
         then they pack         
 a thick layer of rubber onto it

262
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,199
      so it will be easier      
      to shape to the tire.     

263
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,402
         using a special        
        applicator wheel,       

264
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,872
 they push the bead against the 
 lip of the rubber tire shape.  

265
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:59,544
 the bead adheres, but it needs 
  to be more solidly attached.  

266
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,748
 a spinning disk forces the bead
           more firmly          

267
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,617
    to the rubber tire shape.   

268
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,091
     then the tire assembler    
   folds back the extra rubber  

269
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,625
          from the tire         

270
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:19,330
 and wraps it around the bead,  
 using sheer physical strength. 

271
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:25,169
 they install two or three beads
    on each side of the tire.   

272
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,705
     the multiroller device     
  takes over from the assembler 

273
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,443
   and folds back extra rubber  
   to lock the beads in place.  

274
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,047
      next, the tire turns      

275
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,316
as they wind steel-belted rubber
           around it,           

276
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,653
 followed by a continuous strip 
       of ordinary rubber.      

277
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,323
  that strip builds up contours 
           for tread.           

278
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,801
    the assembler then wraps    
a thick piece of ordinary rubber

279
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,536
     around the outer edge.     

280
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,605
  this is the tire's sidewall.  

281
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,075
    the spinning-disc device    

282
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,111
      presses the sidewall      
          to the tire.          

283
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,250
     this tire is now ready     
           to move on.          

284
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,222
   here, a huge rubber bladder  
      inflates and deflates     

285
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,225
        as they spray it        
    with a nonstick coating.    

286
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:25,029
      this bladder will act     
  as the inner part of a mold.  

287
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:36,373
       they lift the tire       
   onto the deflated bladder.   

288
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:41,012
  they then pump steam into it, 
       expanding the tire.      

289
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,918
        a metal mold with       
 a tread pattern engraved in it 

290
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,655
closes around the swelling tire.

291
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,526
   the tire cooks in this mold  
       for up to 18 hours,      

292
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,728
   causing the rubber to cure.  

293
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:05,269
         the giant tire         
pops out of the mold with tread.

294
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,412
         the brand name         
   and identification numbers   

295
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,682
      have all been molded      
        into the rubber.        

296
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,620
         after cooling,         

297
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:27,491
   an inspection team examines  
 the giant tire inside and out. 

298
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,562
   and once it gets the okay,   
       it's ready to roll.      

299
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,630
  and with all that deep tread, 

300
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,301
  each giant tire is guaranteed 
    to make a big impression    

301
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,470
         on the jobsite.
