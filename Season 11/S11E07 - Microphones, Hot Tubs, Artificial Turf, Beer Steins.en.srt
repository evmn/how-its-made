1
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,987
narrator: people have been doing
     mike checks since 1876,    

2
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,590
when the microphone was invented
    as part of the telephone.   

3
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,193
    microphones convert sound   
           to a signal          

4
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,727
     that can be transmitted    

5
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,930
  through televisions, radios,  
     and many other things.     

6
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,733
  if you have something to say, 

7
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,335
    you'll need a microphone    
        to broadcast it.        

8
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,810
  from the glory days of radio  

9
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,212
      to stage and screen       
      and the digital age,      

10
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,948
    the microphone has been     
    at the center of it all.    

11
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,752
   to make a broadcast-quality  
           microphone,          

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,355
           they start           
 with the support piece for it. 

13
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,891
         automated tools        
     carve a brass cylinder     

14
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,493
   to the desired dimensions.   

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,832
 they also make a retainer ring 
    for the microphone grille   

16
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,569
        that will anchor        
    the grille's metal mesh.    

17
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:47,106
 they layer three sheets of mesh
         and align them.        

18
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:52,177
        then they solder        
   the three sheets together.   

19
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,348
a punch press forms the soldered
   mesh into a concave shape.   

20
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,655
   they lower a blade to slice  
    the shaped mesh in half.    

21
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:08,260
   the two pieces will be used  
 to make one microphone grille. 

22
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,800
      an assembler squeezes     
          solder paste          

23
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,801
into a groove in the brass ring.

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,937
         then he presses        
       the grille halves,       

25
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,206
     which have been joined     
          by a bracket          

26
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,575
  into the solder-coated ring.  

27
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,745
         on a carousel,         
    a torch heats the rings,    

28
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,616
 and the solder paste melts to  
 bond the grilles to the rings. 

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,758
 a drill punctures a brass disk 
         up to 90 times         

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,759
   to make ventilation holes.   

31
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:46,097
 another tool levels the surface
  and shaves off unwanted bits. 

32
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,367
 this disk will be the backplate

33
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,102
   for one of the microphone's  
            capsules.           

34
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,506
    an assembler brushes away   
     any remaining shavings     

35
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,042
  and then fixes the backplate  
      in a holding device.      

36
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:04,115
      this plastic membrane     
 has been coated with real gold 

37
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,717
     to conduct electricity.    

38
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,321
   she places the membrane and  
 a plastic ring on the backplate

39
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,857
        and then attaches       
       an electrical lead.      

40
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,866
she screws the plastic ring down
    to secure the assembly...   

41
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:27,539
     ...and then trims away     
  the excess plastic membrane.  

42
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,875
     this microphone capsule    
        is now complete.        

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,145
 next, she'll join two capsules 

44
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:36,080
    to create the unit that's   
  the heart of the microphone.  

45
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,017
        it converts sound       
   into an electrical signal.   

46
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,154
       an aluminum spacer       
   goes between the capsules,   

47
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:47,225
    which face back-to-back.    

48
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,760
   two capsules instead of one  

49
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,229
      means this microphone     
         can be switched        

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,699
        to pick up audio        
    from various directions.    

51
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,537
        a plastic bracket       
      reinforces assembly.      

52
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,178
     a technician then wires    
     the brass support piece    

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,382
 that we saw being made earlier 
    to the electronic system,   

54
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,985
     and then he secures it     
          with screws.          

55
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,527
   after installing switches,   

56
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,897
    he inserts the microphone   
     capsules in the grille.    

57
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,336
 he screws the capsule assembly 
          to the grille         

58
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,105
and joins it to the electronics.

59
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,812
   he slides the metal casing   
      over the electronics      

60
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,149
   and secures the microphone   
      with a big screw cap.     

61
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,956
      he checks the switch      

62
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,558
 that changes the directionality
          of the mike.          

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,662
       and now it's ready       
       for a sound check.       

64
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,036
  the mike goes into a special  
        anechoic chamber.       

65
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,104
a computer measures its response

66
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,409
  to various audio frequencies  
         and directions.        

67
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,315
  once a microphone has passed  
this test and some other checks,

68
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,785
     it's time to pack it up    
        with great care,        

69
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,586
  because this mike is delicate 

70
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,457
            and worth           
    several thousand dollars.   

71
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,392
        treated properly,       

72
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,395
   this microphone should last  
        several decades.        

73
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,699
  in showbiz, that's longevity. 

74
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,152
            narrator:           
  like natural hot springs that 
are heated by the earth's crust,

75
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,756
 a hot tub can give your aching 
 muscles that healing feeling.  

76
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,425
      in fact, the hot tub      
     is a high-tech version     

77
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,293
 of the hot-springs phenomenon, 

78
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,363
 and its invention in the middle
       of the 20th century      

79
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,433
     made the backyard steam    
   part of the suburban dream.  

80
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,373
 there are up to a hundred jets 
      in a modern hot tub.      

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,511
each churns up the water, making
waves that have a calming effect

82
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:23,048
   on tense and tired muscles.  

83
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,652
 to make a hot tub, they start  
 with a sheet of rigid acrylic. 

84
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,189
      they rest it briefly      
    over a mold of a hot tub.   

85
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,793
     then a framelike clamp     
    grips it along the edges    

86
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,129
  and transfers it to an oven.  

87
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,003
  the oven has heating elements 
     on the top and bottom.     

88
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:50,208
  they bake the acrylic sheet   
  until it's so soft, it sags.  

89
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,413
 they transfer the sagging sheet
        back to the mold.       

90
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:58,283
      and now they turn on      
   a vacuum system underneath.  

91
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,085
   it sucks the acrylic sheet   
  into the crevices of the mold 

92
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,588
   so that it takes its shape.  

93
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,360
         then fans cool         
       the molded acrylic,      

94
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,062
         and it hardens         
  in just a couple of minutes.  

95
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,104
      operators then stack      
         the tub shell.         

96
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,041
   they mold swim spa shelves   
   using the same technique.    

97
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,577
 swim spas are longer and deeper
         than hot tubs.         

98
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,647
    they're for working out,    
         not unwinding,         

99
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,318
   so there aren't many ledges  
       for sitting around.      

100
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,659
 back in the hot-tub department,
   it's time for a base coat.   

101
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,593
  they spray resin on the shell 

102
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,864
and then unwind fiberglass twine
    into a special spray gun.   

103
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,935
      it chops up the twine     
  and mixes it with more resin  

104
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,537
        to give the shelf       
      a fiberglass coating      

105
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,806
  that reinforces the acrylic.  

106
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,178
 they press out any air pockets 
       in the fiberglass.       

107
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,951
 now they aim another spray gun 
  at the underside of the tub.  

108
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,253
            this one            
    contains insulating foam.   

109
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,228
     then they trim the lip     
 of the tub with a circular saw,

110
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,731
     so it will sit properly    
       in the frame later.      

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,902
       they sand the edges      

112
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,439
      and then drill holes      
     for the numerous jets.     

113
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,976
 working from inside of the tub,

114
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,646
 an assembler tucks plastic jets
         into the holes,        

115
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,583
while a worker on the other side
     pulls the jets through.    

116
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,586
   they apply silicone sealant  
        around each jet,        

117
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,121
          then equip it         
       with a plastic ring      

118
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,192
      for aligning the jet      
      to the hot-tub frame.     

119
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,793
      using a special tool,     

120
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:53,064
   the assembler drives a nut   
 into the assembly to secure it.

121
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,866
    next, they dip pvc tubing   
           in adhesive          

122
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,735
   and attach it to the jets,   

123
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,939
    weaving an elaborate web    
            of hoses.           

124
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,079
       the narrower tubing      
   will pipe air to the jets,   

125
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,815
      while the wider hoses     
       will supply water.       

126
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,016
        to prevent leaks,       

127
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,886
         they equip them        
  with self-tensioning clamps.  

128
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,558
  they connect the intake pipe  
          to the pump,          

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,161
     which will force water     
        into the tubing.        

130
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,430
  a suction system will return  
     the water to this pump.    

131
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,234
        they wire the tub       
    to provide mood lighting,   

132
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,970
    then test all the wiring    
          and plumbing.         

133
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,975
 they spray more insulating foam
   on the outside of the tub.   

134
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,576
     it expands drastically     

135
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,680
    in closing the labyrinth    
       of pipes and hoses.      

136
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,189
 and for some extra insulation, 

137
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,526
  they wrap foil-backed plastic 
         around the tub.        

138
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,630
    the foil will reflect any   
escaping heat back onto the tub.

139
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,868
they mount the exterior paneling

140
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,138
and drill through the insulation
       to vent the pumps.       

141
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,143
      corner molding gives      
   the paneling a nice finish.  

142
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,817
  this hot tub is now ready to  
 make waves in the neighborhood.

143
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,152
     some versions even come    
            with tvs,           

144
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,089
so you can watch "how it's made"
  without leaving the hot tub.  

145
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,091
 it takes about 20 person-hours 

146
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,895
        to make a hot tub       
   or one of these swim spas.   

147
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:35,100
   and after that, it's time    
   to take a break and relax.   

148
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,116
   narrator: the invention of   
  artificial turf in the 1960s  

149
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,851
   led to a whole new field --  

150
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,988
  one that never needs mowing,  
      watering, or weeding.     

151
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,058
    faux grass was developed    
     by the carpet industry     

152
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,927
        and made possible       
   by technological advances,   

153
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,830
         and the concept        
     has really taken root.     

154
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,204
         synthetic turf         
    has changed the landscape   

155
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,939
     of professional sports.    

156
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,476
 you see it in stadiums, arenas,
       and training fields      

157
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,479
        around the world.       

158
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,883
     it all starts with bags    
    of white plastic pellets.   

159
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,153
    this is the base material   
          for the turf.         

160
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,290
     they add green pellets     
           for color,           

161
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,293
 along with chemical stabilizers
         and additives.         

162
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,962
         equipment melts        
    and extrudes the plastic    

163
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,465
      through a steel plate     
        with holes in it.       

164
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,200
 this creates strands of green. 

165
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,237
        the strands exit        
   through a trough of water,   

166
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,873
which cools and solidifies them.

167
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,581
   machinery pulls the strands  
    through an enormous comb    

168
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,185
    to keep them separated as   
 they head to the next station. 

169
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,189
      here, rollers stretch     
           the strands          

170
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,925
    until they become as thin   
         as real grass.         

171
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,694
         the stretching         
     also strengthens them.     

172
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:16,334
       spools now roll up       
     the synthetic strands.     

173
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,714
      once a spool is full,     
         they remove it.        

174
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,254
next, they unwind several spools
           at a time.           

175
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:46,096
  the strands come together to  
form a multi-ply synthetic yarn.

176
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,833
  the yarn travels over guides. 

177
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:53,371
  this keeps it from slackening 
   as a big spool winds it up.  

178
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,377
             further            
    down the production line,   

179
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,779
       mesh fabric merges       
    with synthetic sheeting,    

180
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,382
  while the multi-ply synthetic 
   yarn travels through tubing  

181
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,252
      to a tufting machine.     

182
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,124
       the tufting machine      
   is a giant sewing machine.   

183
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,059
    it has up to 250 needles.   

184
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,262
   these needles hook the yarn  

185
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,530
        through the mesh        
       synthetic sheeting.      

186
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,567
   they make hundreds of rows   
     of stitches per minute.    

187
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,876
    underneath, small knives    
      cut the looped yarn,      

188
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,445
     so it looks like spikes    
            of grass.           

189
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,085
  as you can see, this process  
      is a whole lot faster     

190
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,955
 than waiting for grass to grow.

191
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:48,092
 an inspector examines the turf 
to make sure the yarns are even.

192
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,495
 then machinery moves it forward
      to a coating roller.      

193
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,698
  the roller picks up adhesive  
       from a trough below      

194
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,569
  and applies it to the backing 
 of the turf as it moves across.

195
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,974
  this binds the looped web of  
artificial grass to the backing.

196
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,983
   the adhesive is a bit gooey  
          at this point         

197
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,619
     and needs to be dried.     

198
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,058
  the dryer is partly open-air  
      and partly enclosed.      

199
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,861
      the enclosed section      
     is about 55 yards low.     

200
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,530
         the temperature        
    is carefully controlled.    

201
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,066
too hot, and the synthetic grass
           might melt.          

202
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:32,736
as it exits, hot pins burn holes
          into the turf         

203
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,372
   to make it water-permeable.  

204
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,614
now they check to make sure this
grass looks good on the surface.

205
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,950
    they pull out loose bits    
    and measure the fibers.     

206
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,752
   then it's over to a device   

207
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,688
    that simulates the effect   
       of football cleats       

208
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,224
 to confirm this turf is tough. 

209
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,559
   to install artificial turf,  

210
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,495
     they lay a rubber base     
        and add the turf.       

211
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,899
      they distribute sand      
   throughout spikes of grass   

212
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,701
    to give the turf weight.    

213
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,972
then they spread rubber granules
     for a softening effect.    

214
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,045
          but some turf         
      is more carpetlike --     

215
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,847
       no fillers needed.       

216
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,883
 you're more likely to see that 
     in floor-hockey arenas.    

217
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,822
 it's time to wrap up this turf 
job and toss a few balls around.

218
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,730
  and when it comes to looking  
      like the real thing,      

219
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:36,567
  artificial turf is definitely 
        in the ballpark.        

220
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,215
            narrator:           
  a stein is a beer mug with a  
 hinged lid you open and close. 

221
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,283
  according to some historians, 

222
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,585
         it's a product         
     of the bubonic plague.     

223
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,155
  after the plague swept europe 
          in the 1300s,         

224
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,557
         municipalities         
    enacted sanitation laws.    

225
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,893
  in germany, one law required  
  food and beverage containers  

226
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,064
         to have covers         
  in order to keep out insects. 

227
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,236
        these traditional       
       german beer steins,      

228
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,906
with their ornate ceramic bodies
         and pewter lids        

229
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,573
  are functional works of art.  

230
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,310
        the word "stein"        
   is short for a german word   

231
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,912
    meaning "stoneware jug."    

232
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,515
        production begins       
    in the casting department   

233
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,050
     with a plaster mold --     

234
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,453
 its cavity the shape and design
      of the stein's body.      

235
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,189
    they pour in liquid clay,   

236
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,791
      wait about two hours      
       until it thickens,       

237
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,394
          then pour out         
    whatever liquid remains.    

238
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,730
  after testing the consistency 
     of what's still inside,    

239
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,933
    they gingerly disassemble   
            the mold,           

240
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,467
   revealing the stein's body.  

241
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,137
    the mold has transferred    
    all the intricate detail    

242
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,405
     to the clay's surface.     

243
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,276
    for certain stein shapes,   

244
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,546
     they get better results    
        using solid clay.       

245
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,482
          they cut off          
      the amount they need,     

246
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,153
          then drop it          
     inside a plaster mold.     

247
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,691
    a machine pushes the clay   

248
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,294
       into every crevice       
       of the mold cavity.      

249
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:13,297
 a worker trims away any excess 
         that oozes out.        

250
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,934
then the mold goes into a drying
     machine for 20 minutes.    

251
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,838
       when it comes out,       

252
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,075
  they disassemble the sections 
     to extract the casting.    

253
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,247
    whether made from liquid    
         or solid clay,         

254
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,517
      each stein body goes      
      on a potter's wheel       

255
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,519
       for some refining.       

256
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,987
    the potter removes seams    

257
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,522
           that formed          
  where the mold sections met.  

258
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,259
          he also trims         
    and smoothes out the rim.   

259
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,061
    then, using some wet clay   
         as an adhesive,        

260
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,863
  he attaches an ornate handle. 

261
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,399
            it, too,            
    is made entirely of clay.   

262
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,935
      the factory shapes it     
        either in a mold        

263
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,537
    or with a dye in a press.   

264
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,606
 finally, they stamp the bottom 
        with two marks --       

265
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,410
        "made in germany"       
     and the company brand.     

266
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,280
now the coloring process begins.

267
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,749
  they coat the stein body with 
  special paint for ceramics -- 

268
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,886
     first, a watery coat of    
 the background color all over, 

269
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,190
   then a thicker coat around   
 the reliefs to highlight them. 

270
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,696
   they rub most of the paint   
         off the reliefs        

271
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,099
   to accentuate the contrast.  

272
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:25,903
   next, workers spray a milky  
    glaze over the stein body   

273
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,304
         inside and out.        

274
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,707
    this glaze is made mainly   
     of sodium and silicon,     

275
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,776
       minerals that turn       
     into transparent glass     

276
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,111
        under high heat.        

277
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,380
      this will strengthen      
  and waterproof the stoneware  

278
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,116
           beneath it.          

279
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,052
  workers load dozens of stein  
      bodies into an oven,      

280
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,122
  where they bake at more than  
    2,000 degrees fahrenheit    

281
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,323
          for 12 hours.         

282
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,194
     this hardens the clay,     
    turns the colors vibrant,   

283
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:55,399
    and transforms the glaze    
into a protective glass coating.

284
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:59,670
 after a 12-hour cooling period,
    the true artistry begins.   

285
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,874
        a skilled painter       
     embellishes the design     

286
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,343
  with colorful enamel paints.  

287
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,765
   a second firing, this time   
     for just 5 to 6 hours,     

288
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,637
         bakes the paint        
     onto the glass surface.    

289
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,107
     now, to top it all off,    
     the stein's ornate lid.    

290
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,777
       it's made of pewter      
         cast in a mold.        

291
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,580
  the thumb lift pivots the lid 
           on a hinge.          

292
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,982
       to attach the lid        
       to the stein body,       

293
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,184
  they position the thumb lift  
         on the handle,         

294
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,087
          then assemble         
 a small mounting tool over it. 

295
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,493
  they pour in molten pewter... 

296
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,598
 ...then, after a minute or so, 
       remove the device.       

297
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,068
     the pewter has hardened    
           into a ring          

298
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,671
    attaching the thumb lift    
         to the handle.         

299
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:13,311
    they clip off the excess,   
 then buff the metal to a shine.

300
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:24,554
  with their traditional scenes 
  or more contemporary themes,  

301
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,958
        these beer steins       
   are the toast of the town.
