00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,025
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,720
    pressed glass originated    

3
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,723
         in 19th century        
      america and england,      

4
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,192
and it revolutionized glassware.

5
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,595
 it offered the look of crystal 
          on a budget,          

6
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,064
         adding elegance        
        to a humble meal.       

7
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,666
         it became known        
    as "poor man's crystal."    

8
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,369
  today, this affordable glass  
        still has class.        

9
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,209
 pressed glass or cut crystal...

10
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,211
  invented in the 18th century, 

11
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,080
          pressed glass         
    can still impress company   

12
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,682
     and keep them guessing.    

13
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:28,154
    pressed-glass ingredients   
  include lime, sodium nitrate, 

14
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:31,156
     soda ash, silica sand,     

15
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,160
 mineral or chemical colorants, 

16
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:38,230
 and leftover or rejected glass 
        from the factory.       

17
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,565
    they melt the ingredients   

18
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,369
     in a furnace heated at     
 over 2,900 degrees fahrenheit. 

19
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,972
      a worker twirls a rod     
 with a ceramic bowl on the end 

20
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,709
   into it, and the hot liquid  
       glass clings to it.      

21
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,779
  then it's ready for transfer  
        to the iron mold.       

22
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,714
  when the mold is partly full, 

23
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:59,518
 a worker snips the liquid glass
 with scissors to cut the flow. 

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,454
   he places a ring with pegs   
  on the rim to align the mold  

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,923
         with a plunger.        

26
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,191
      he lowers the plunger     

27
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,460
  and applies physical pressure 
           to a lever           

28
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,062
      to squeeze the glass      
      into every crevice.       

29
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:13,865
 this transforms the glass blob 
        into a berry bowl       

30
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,535
   with elaborate impressions   
         on the outside.        

31
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:20,873
  as it cools, the bowl hardens 
  just enough to be extracted,  

32
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,376
   but it's still quite soft.   

33
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,411
             careful            
    to not distort the shape,   

34
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,547
      he transfers the bowl     
         to two bricks.         

35
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,885
 a hose below the bricks pumps  
 air to cool the glass further. 

36
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,488
  over a period of four hours,  

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,091
 the team makes 250 berry bowls.

38
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,426
        some of the bowls       
        will be flattened       

39
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,628
          to turn them          
      into dessert plates,      

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,465
   while others will be worked  
into the shape of candy baskets.

41
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,769
         once the glass         
      has firmed up enough,     

42
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,173
the bowls take a couple of trips
       through the glazer,      

43
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,576
       first upside down,       
     and then right side up.    

44
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,512
        a gas flame melts       
  the outer layer of the glass  

45
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,515
        to make it shine        
      both inside and out.      

46
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,387
 he clamps the bowl onto the end
     of a rod called a snap,    

47
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,625
    and places into a second    
    smaller furnace briefly.    

48
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,928
     this softens the glass     

49
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,931
          to prepare it         
   for another transformation.  

50
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,533
    still clamped on the rod,   

51
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,068
    a worker spins the bowl.    

52
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,204
with a stick of wood, he applies
   pressure to the upper part   

53
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,808
  to flatten and flare it out.  

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,477
     he then draws the piece    
        between two pipes       

55
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,947
    to bend the sides upward.   

56
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,685
  the pressed-glass berry bowl  
 has now become a candy basket, 

57
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,820
    but baskets need handles,   

58
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:46,291
   so it's back to the furnace  
      to gather more glass.     

59
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,928
           he collects          
    a little less this time.    

60
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,034
    he moves the molten glass   
     around on a metal table    

61
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,169
       to roll it longer.       

62
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,841
     he inserts it in a mold    

63
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,877
      that gives the glass      
         a rib pattern.         

64
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,485
       he heats the glass       
  in the furnace one more time. 

65
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,991
   soft and sticky, the glass   
  handle adheres to the basket. 

66
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,927
   he pulls the handle longer   
    as he twirls the basket,    

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,197
 and then attaches the other end
      of the handle to it.      

68
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
   the handle is a bit saggy,   
       so before it cools,      

69
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,470
      he improves the shape     
      using an iron roller.     

70
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,005
     as he works the glass,     

71
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,544
     he pulls the handle up     
 and makes it more well-rounded.

72
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,346
            unclamped           
   from the gathering rod now,  

73
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,748
  he smoothes the outer surface 
          of the handle         

74
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,852
      and tweaks its shape      
        until satisfied.        

75
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,757
         using a torch,         
    he melts the glass a bit    

76
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,359
        where the handle        
        meets the basket        

77
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:56,095
    to improve the adhesion.    

78
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,702
 and now it's over to the oven. 

79
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,440
              here,             
   the pressed glass is heated  

80
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,109
         and then cooled        
       to room temperature      

81
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,245
          over a period         
   of three and a half hours.   

82
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,381
      this gradual heating      
    and cooling is critical.    

83
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,051
       it releases stress       
      in the pressed glass      

84
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,253
     to make it less likely     
           to shatter.          

85
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,858
        for generations,        
      molds have been used      

86
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,793
         to mass produce        
      pressed-glass pieces      

87
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,863
          that can look         
     like expensive crystal.    

88
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:34,900
  with all that practice, they  
  have this down to a fine art. 

89
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,339
  some works are reproductions  
       of vintage pieces,       

90
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,675
    others are new patterns.    

91
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,412
     the appeal is timeless.    

92
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,232
            narrator:           
     pickup trucks are ideal    

93
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,033
     for transporting tools     
         and materials,         

94
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,568
      but often these items     
       have to be covered       

95
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,171
 and locked away to protect them
  from the elements and theft.  

96
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,108
  that's why many pickup owners 
          install caps,         

97
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,711
 hard top covers typically made 
    of fiberglass or aluminum   

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,281
 with optional built-in storage.

99
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,453
     this truck cap is made     
     of durable fiberglass      

100
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,789
         and is designed        
 to fit every full-sized pickup 

101
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,524
         on the market.         

102
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:36,195
      a truck cap has to be     
 both practical and attractive, 

103
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:40,599
     so it first takes shape    
 on a car designer's sketch pad.

104
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,469
engineers use computer software 
to translate the design sketches

105
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,073
     into technical drawings    
  for producing several molds,  

106
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,277
   one for each of the various  
     parts of the truck cap.    

107
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,480
    the first step is to wax    
       the mold's surface,      

108
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,817
   so that the truck cap part   
       will extra easily.       

109
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,220
        the mold is made        
     of colored fiber glass     

110
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:05,623
 to contrast the white materials
      they'll apply to it.      

111
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,227
  the first of those materials  
 is gel coat, a polyester resin 

112
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,232
     that produces a smooth     
 and shiny finish on fiberglass.

113
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,234
          they spray on         
  a half millimeter thick coat. 

114
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,637
     the beauty of gel coat     
     is that a nick or crack    

115
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,976
   can be easily repaired with  
 a bit of grinding and filling. 

116
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,244
   so the truck cap's surface   

117
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:29,248
     can always be restored     
     to an impeccable state.    

118
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,251
       the gel coat cures       
      in about 45 minutes,      

119
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:35,187
    at which point they begin   
 shooting chopped up fiberglass 

120
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,589
 that's impregnated with resin. 

121
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,992
  they compress this new layer  
          with rollers          

122
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:43,595
to about five millimeters thick.

123
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:47,066
    roughly two hours later,    
     the resin has hardened     

124
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,401
          and it's time         
 to use special extraction jacks

125
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,304
  to remove the now solid roof  
         from the mold.         

126
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,943
  they repeat this same molding 
process for all the other parts.

127
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:01,012
  because this particular truck 
   cap model has double doors   

128
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,815
   on both the back and side,   

129
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,617
  there are 10 different parts  
            to mold.            

130
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,957
  a robotic circular saw trims  
        each molded part.       

131
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,094
     this is the truck cap's    
         air deflector.         

132
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,363
    the saw blade has diamond   
 particles affixed to its edge, 

133
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:23,435
     enabling it to cut the     
fiberglass without shredding it.

134
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:26,305
           by the time          
  the robot finishes trimming,  

135
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,574
         the part meets         
      exact specifications      

136
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,976
   and has neat, smooth edges.  

137
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,648
  with all the parts ready now, 

138
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,485
            it's time           
   to assemble the truck cap.   

139
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,460
   first, they unite the roof   
   and the universal fit base.  

140
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,797
           both slide           
     into an aluminum trim.     

141
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,133
 workers clamp them in position 
        from the inside.        

142
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:01,340
        next, as required       
  by motor vehicle regulations, 

143
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:05,077
    they install brake lights   
  at the top of the rear doors. 

144
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,216
              then,             
  on the right-side rear door,  

145
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,152
           they mount           
  a chrome-plated door handle.  

146
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:18,090
  the plating has been treated  
 with an anti-corrosion coating.

147
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,759
  for the sake of convenience,  
      the door handle lock      

148
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,829
       is designed to work      
  with the truck's ignition key 

149
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,030
  so the driver doesn't have to 
   carry around a separate key  

150
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,300
          for the cap.          

151
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,968
            the doors           
    mount with sturdy hinges    

152
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,238
   is made of stainless steel,  
    which is rust resistant.    

153
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,444
  next, using a template to get 
   the positioning just right,  

154
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,380
      they glue the company     
      and model name logos      

155
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,648
     to the right rear door.    

156
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,784
         for aesthetics,        
       these plastic logos      

157
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,521
        are chrome plated       
    to match the door handle.   

158
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,190
    after mounting the doors,   

159
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,659
     they install gas struts    
          on each door          

160
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:57,395
      to provide resistance     
   to control the door swing.   

161
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,864
   workers also install a pair  

162
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,132
       of three-foot-long       
         l.e.d. lights.         

163
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,600
  they're on a magnetic switch, 

164
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:07,072
     turning them on and off    
 when the doors open and close. 

165
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,675
  once it's fully assembled, it 
undergoes a thorough inspection.

166
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,879
           a truck cap          
    weighs about 660 pounds,    

167
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,516
  so you need a mechanical lift 
    to mount it on a pickup.    

168
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,486
           it affixes           
    with four tie-down levers   

169
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,821
   that hook under the rails,   

170
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,224
 running down the interior sides
          of the truck          

171
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,261
      so there's no chance      
     of the cap lifting off.    

172
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,564
       before shipping out      
        to the customer,        

173
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,968
         every truck cap        
   goes through a water test,   

174
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,837
     subjected to a torrent     
   for three minutes straight   

175
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,440
          to make sure          
     no water leaks inside.     

176
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:49,447
   truck caps can be ordered    
   with a pull-out cargo bed,   

177
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,717
     shelving, storage bins,    

178
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,919
       and other features,      

179
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,655
          transforming          
    an ordinary pickup truck    

180
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,758
   into a workshop on wheels.   

181
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,209
  narrator: what's warm, soft,  
        water repellent,        

182
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,012
     and, as an added bonus,    
         hypoallergenic?        

183
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,280
 something made of alpaca yarn. 

184
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,615
    similar to sheep's wool,    

185
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,883
          it's smoother         
   due to the scale structure   

186
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,686
    of the individual fibers.   

187
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,354
 and it doesn't contain lanolin,

188
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,690
  a natural wax in sheep's wool 

189
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,926
            to which            
    some people are allergic.   

190
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,564
          alpacas come          
     in 22 different colors,    

191
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,164
     ranging from pure white    

192
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,901
     through various shades     
       of beiges, browns,       

193
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,704
    and grays, to pure black.   

194
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,774
  breeders shear their alpacas  
       and sell the fleece      

195
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,177
       or send it to mills      
    for processing into yarn.   

196
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,246
          white fleece          
     is in greatest demand,     

197
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,449
       and it can be dyed       
      any number of colors.     

198
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,251
 before sending out the fleece, 

199
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,653
   the breeders pull off hay,   
             leaves,            

200
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,122
 and other stuck-on vegetation. 

201
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,991
         when the fleece        
      arrives at the mill,      

202
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,927
      it undergoes repeated     
    washes with natural soaps   

203
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,530
      until it's pristine.      

204
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,265
   after the fleece air dries,  

205
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,933
         a conveyer belt        
    feeds it into the picker.   

206
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,137
    the machine's tooth drum    
    pulls apart the clumps,     

207
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,807
        a process called        
      "opening the fibers."     

208
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,676
      the drum then shoots      
 those fibers into a compartment

209
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,546
    called the picker closet.   

210
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,481
       once all the fleece      
        has been opened,        

211
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,684
    they turn off the machine   
   and spray the fluffy fibers  

212
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,487
     thoroughly with a blend    
        of conditioners.        

213
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,290
   these conditioners are left  
       to absorb overnight      

214
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:42,127
  to reduce static electricity  
    the next step generates.    

215
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,899
       the fiber separator      
        combs the fibers        

216
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,969
          with a series         
     of fine tooth rollers.     

217
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,440
       this simultaneously      
     straightens the fibers     

218
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,444
  and separates them by grade.  

219
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,645
    the first set of rollers    

220
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,849
   removes any remaining bits   
         of vegetation,         

221
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,518
      while the second set      
      removes coarse fibers     

222
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,288
  so that only very fine fibers 
        exit the machine.       

223
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,292
          the next step         
 is to divide these fine fibers 

224
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,161
  into bundles of equal weight. 

225
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,266
      the set weight varies     
 according to the grade of fiber

226
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:25,337
     that the next machine,     
 the carder, will be processing.

227
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,540
          a fine fiber          
    requires heavier bundles.   

228
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,615
  the conveyer belt feeding the 
  carder is marked in sections. 

229
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,685
      they place one bundle     
        in each section.        

230
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,354
     this steady, even input    

231
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:46,825
    ensures that the machine    
  produces a consistent output. 

232
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,693
       inside the carder,       

233
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,062
    a series of combs spreads   
     the fibers over a drum,    

234
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,966
     aligning them parallel     
         to each other.         

235
00:13:54,968 --> 00:14:00,572
this produces a thin, flat layer
    of fine fiber called web.   

236
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,641
       web can be stacked       
       in several layers        

237
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,842
        to make batting,        

238
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,712
      the stuffing material     
      in quilts and duvets.     

239
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,516
         batting can be         
  further processed into felt.  

240
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,786
    web can also be processed   
          into roving,          

241
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,055
  a long thick stream of fiber  

242
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,991
  which crafts people hand spin 
           into yarn,           

243
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,661
  or which high-speed machines  
        here at the mill        

244
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:25,730
  spin into store-bought yarn.  

245
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,334
  the roving deck on the carder 
compresses the web into a stream

246
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,103
        while rotating it       
   to hold the aligned fibers   

247
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,872
     in a snake like shape.     

248
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,075
      to make what's known      
         as woolen yarn,        

249
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,145
           the roving           
  goes directly to the spinner. 

250
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,014
 however, to make what's called 
       semi-worsted yarn,       

251
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,149
          this machine,         
      called a draw frame,      

252
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,419
       must first combine       
       two or more rovings      

253
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:52,023
    into a consistent stream    
        called a sliver.        

254
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,424
      the thinner the yarn,     

255
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:57,495
   the more often the rovings   
  pass through the draw frame.  

256
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,297
    finally, several slivers    

257
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,566
         simultaneously         
       enter the spinner,       

258
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,968
which twists each one separately
      through a combination     

259
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,438
     of pressure and speed.     

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,507
        the next machine,       
        called the plyer,       

261
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,576
       then forms the yarn      
  by twisting multiple singles  

262
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,179
            together            
   in the opposite direction.   

263
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,180
      twisting two singles,     

264
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,249
          for example,          
      makes a two-ply yarn.     

265
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,051
   the mill produces different  
         weights of yarn        

266
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,119
       from lace to bulky,      

267
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,655
      by varying the volume     
        of fiber per ply,       

268
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,926
 as well as the spinning speed. 

269
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,794
      they mount the spools     
        of finished yarn        

270
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,063
      on the skein winder.      

271
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,934
   a skein is a bundle of yarn  
that's first wound then twisted.

272
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,738
  they set the machine to wind  
   a specific length of yarn.   

273
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,072
         when it stops,         

274
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,209
 they tie the skein on two ends 
         and remove it.         

275
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:48,346
     then they dye the yarn     
 or leave it its natural color. 

276
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,416
   some mills dye their fleece  
         after washing,         

277
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,685
     prior to processing it     
           into yarn.           

278
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,888
         the final step         
   is to hand-twist the skein.  

279
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,159
 they also wind yarn into balls 
           and cones.           

280
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,029
    warm and water repellent,   
 this silky, smooth alpaca yarn 

281
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:10,402
      is all set to be knit     
  or woven into a cozy woolen.  

282
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
   narrator: the utility knife  
 is known by many other names --

283
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:31,789
    carpet knife, box cutter,   
        sheet-rock knife,       

284
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,793
 and craft knife are just a few.

285
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,862
         all those names        
      reflect the many uses     

286
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:40,866
   for this retractable knife   
 and its incredible versatility.

287
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,869
  it comes in handy every time. 

288
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,074
   in 70 years, the design of   
 this retractable utility knife 

289
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,010
   hasn't really changed much.  

290
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,080
     why mess with a concept    
           that works?          

291
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,482
          a hollow case         
    with an interlocking nose   

292
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,819
         for the blade,         
held together by a single screw.

293
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:05,556
   it can be easily unscrewed   
 to access spare blades inside. 

294
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,562
to make the blades, carbon steel
    uncoils into a die press.   

295
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:14,032
   a roller takes up the slack  
       as the steel inches      

296
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,267
    forward for each forming.   

297
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,170
   the press scores the steel   

298
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,239
     to rough out the shape     
         of the blades,         

299
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,042
  punches notches for attaching 
       them to the handle,      

300
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,145
 and stamps product information 
           onto them.           

301
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:34,519
at this point, the steel is just
a little stiffer than tin foil. 

302
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,522
  a trip through a 25-foot-long 
     furnace toughens it up.    

303
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,060
    exposed to scorching heat   
   and then quenched by water,  

304
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,131
the steel hardens significantly.

305
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,066
      after the brand name      
 has been printed on the steel, 

306
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,803
   the ribbon of blades rides   
   through a grinding station   

307
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,606
         with different         
     stone-grinding wheels.     

308
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,743
  they sharpen the steel edge.  

309
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,212
      the steel now passes      
     under an induction coil    

310
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:04,649
  that radiates heat to further 
    harden the cutting edge.    

311
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,285
  a machine called the breaker  

312
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,222
         snaps the steel        
     along the score lines.     

313
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,358
          it spits out          
  the unwanted triangular bits  

314
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,293
       between the blades       
         for recycling.         

315
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,096
           the blades           
     flow out of the breaker    

316
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,031
    and into a steel channel.   

317
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:24,169
       a pusher moves them      
  down the channel into a tray. 

318
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:29,307
   this system snaps and packs  
      250 blades a minute.      

319
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,578
they insert one blade from every
production run into this tester.

320
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,448
   the tester moves the blade   
   back and forth repeatedly    

321
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,784
  to slice through thick stacks 
        of paper strips.        

322
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,852
    this gives them a measure   

323
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,255
    of the blade's sharpness    
         and durability.        

324
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,325
     the transformation from    
blunt metal to razor sharp blade

325
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,528
          is complete,          
  and the utility knife blades  

326
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,530
            are ready           
    for the gripping part --    

327
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,799
         the zinc case.         

328
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,803
  they cast the back and front  
      of the case in a die.     

329
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,740
  the parts then bounce around  
       in a vibratory bowl      

330
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,276
           along with           
  pyramid-shaped ceramic rocks. 

331
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,280
          the friction          
    smoothes the rough edges.   

332
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,749
     after about a half hour    
     in the vibratory bowl,     

333
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,152
        the casing parts        
        are blemish free.       

334
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,555
they head into the next station.

335
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,892
   here, workers collect them   
  and examine them for defects  

336
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:24,295
        as they hang them       
        on moving racks.        

337
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,232
       the racks will take      
     the utility knife parts    

338
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,567
     through a wash station     

339
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,971
     to get rid of a dusting    
  of zinc and ceramic residue.  

340
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,109
    it's kind of a power wash   
    for the knife case parts.   

341
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,846
  they ride by a high-pressure  
sprayer for a thorough cleaning.

342
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,119
           after that,          
they take a trip through a dryer

343
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,788
         to prepare them        
    for a powder coat finish.   

344
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,724
      once the powder coat      
          is baked on,          

345
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:56,161
    it will protect the zinc    
  utility knife from corrosion. 

346
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,000
         the powder coat        
    gives the utility knives    

347
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,269
    a finish that's tougher     
    than conventional paint.    

348
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,610
             heading            
  into the unload station now,  

349
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,979
     a blast from an air gun    
 knocks the parts off the rack. 

350
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:27,392
  thanks to the tough finish,   
  they land without a scratch.  

351
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,099
     the utility-knife parts    
     are ready for assembly,    

352
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,302
         and the worker         
uses a special fixture for that.

353
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,839
   she places the bottom half   
          of the knife          

354
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,843
   in a recess in the fixture.  

355
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,845
     handling the blunt side    
         of the blades,         

356
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:50,315
 she inserts three of them into 
 the case's storage compartment.

357
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:55,787
     she also tucks the tab     
 of an information card into it.

358
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,523
       next, she installs       
    the retractable mechanism   

359
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,459
  for the utility knife blades. 

360
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,262
    she places the other half   
   of the case on the assembly  

361
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,932
 and then actuates an auto-screw
     gun to close the knife.    

362
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,471
       they assemble over       
  40,000 utility knives per day 

363
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,474
        at this factory.        

364
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,077
    now, that's cutting edge.   

365
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,957
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,        

366
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,760
 or you'd like to suggest topics
        for future shows,       

367
