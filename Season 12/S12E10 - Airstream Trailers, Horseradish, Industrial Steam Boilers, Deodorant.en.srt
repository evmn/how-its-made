captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,720
narrator: in 1931, airstream founder wally byam  

4
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,657
sold plans to build your own travel trailer.        

5
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,725
in response to a growing demand,

6
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,062
he decided manufacturing was the better way to go.   

7
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,797
he then introduced the airstream trailer,     

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,733
with its familiar modern design

9
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,236
that has withstood the test of time.        

10
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,409
the airstream trailer is a recreation vehicle    

11
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,012
that can take you to the most remote areas,   

12
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,648
yet still enjoy        
a fully functional living space.

13
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,620
they can also be hooked up to outside services,      

14
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:31,057
so you can stay as long as   
you like in the comfort of home.

15
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,297
to start, an operator puts a  
sheet of aircraft-grade aluminum

16
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,800
into a press that punches the rivet holes. 

17
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,638
a worker then rivets the sheets together

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,107
to make the walls of the trailer.        

19
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,578
here they're assembling the end shells,        

20
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,349
the rounded end sections for the
front and back of the trailer. 

21
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,856
they apply sealant to all the seams.        

22
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,796
technicians then rivet the two ends    

23
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,666
to the components that make up the trailer shell,

24
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:16,235
including the floor, the walls, and the roof.    

25
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,508
a worker uses a router and a template    

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,278
to cut out window openings from the walls.        

27
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,884
he puts the windows in the openings        

28
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,753
and secures them in place.   

29
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,763
another worker applies a weatherproof sealant 

30
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,831
to all the interior seams,   

31
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,968
then smoothes it out to ensure good coverage.    

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,842
using a crane, they lower the shell onto the chassis.  

33
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:03,315
at this point, they thread some
of the wiring into the shell. 

34
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,054
next comes the plywood floor, 

35
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,024
which a worker attaches firmly to the chassis.        

36
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,830
another associate puts the door in place.    

37
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,801
he rivets the door to the shell.

38
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,137
he takes extra care to protect the aluminum    

39
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,841
from being damaged by the force of the rivet gun. 

40
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,544
the trailer then goes into a rain-test booth     

41
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,147
that simulates hurricane-strength rain.    

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,285
the test lasts about an hour, 

43
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:42,054
during which a technician makes
sure the shell is watertight. 

44
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:54,232
next, they apply a water-based adhesive to the interior    

45
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,137
and install insulation throughout the shell.      

46
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,776
now they bring in the interior skin.       

47
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,414
it's the same aircraft-grade aluminum used on the outside. 

48
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,519
they trim the walls for the window openings    

49
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,921
then lay down the vinyl floor covering.   

50
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,393
an installer trims the vinyl and uses the old-fashioned way 

51
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,063
to make it snug against the shell       

52
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,864
because a standard carpet stretcher  

53
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,266
would poke holes in the vinyl. 

54
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,540
a worker installs the fiberglass shower stall  

55
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,076
and hooks up the drain and plumbing.    

56
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,414
he cuts a hole in the fiberglass

57
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,017
then installs all the shower-control components 

58
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,820
and the showerhead.      

59
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,096
he finishes off this residential-style shower 

60
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,131
with a frosted-glass door.   

61
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,304
next, they put in       
the convertible couches and beds

62
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,874
and all the other amenities of home, including a gas stove.

63
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,715
finally, a technician performs quality-control checks

64
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,385
to make sure the electrical and mechanical systems     

65
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,253
work flawlessly.        

66
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,657
only then is an airstream trailer    

67
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,791
ready to hit the road     

68
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,059
and continue the time-honored tradition   

69
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,461
of discovery and adventure   

70
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,796
that makes this iconic recreation vehicle   

71
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,200
an american original.     

72
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,221
narrator: horseradish has a hot history. 

73
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,890
the ancient greeks used it as an aphrodisiac.   

74
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,127
they also rubbed it on sore body parts to alleviate pain. 

75
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,762
during the renaissance,    

76
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,999
eating horseradish made its way
from central europe to england.

77
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,300
by the late 1600s,       

78
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,635
it was customary among the british       

79
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,138
to eat horseradish with beef and oysters.     

80
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,111
at the root of this hot condiment is a root.    

81
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,049
you peel away an outer skin to access a thick white flesh. 

82
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,452
chewing or grinding the flesh releases enzymes,       

83
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,254
which produce horseradish's heat --     

84
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,325
the plant's natural defense mechanism against predators.  

85
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,462
horseradish is a leafy, flowering plant  

86
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:39,798
with a thick central root, called the mother root,    

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,268
and smaller offshoots called sets.          

88
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,470
after culling the mother root, 

89
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,471
farmers re-plant the sets,   

90
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,475
each of which will spawn a new plant.          

91
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:50,943
at harvest time,        

92
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:54,012
the first farm machine chops down the plants to ground level

93
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,815
and rakes the leaves out of the way.        

94
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,654
then a horseradish harvester digs up the roots.       

95
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,226
as the roots bounce onto a mesh conveyer belt,     

96
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,397
most of the soil breaks off and falls back onto the ground.

97
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,977
you have to keep horseradish cold to keep it hot.      

98
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,446
so the roots go directly into a cooler.         

99
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,914
the temperature is just above freezing     

100
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,385
and the humidity high so    
the roots retain their moisture.

101
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,653
to grind them fresh from the field      

102
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,390
would produce horseradish with a grassy flavor,     

103
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,060
so the roots spend about a month in the cooler.  

104
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,862
only then are they ready for processing. 

105
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,066
at the horseradish factory,  

106
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,036
a machine washes the roots in cold water.         

107
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,645
then a conveyer belt runs   
the roots through a final rinse.

108
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,157
workers carefully inspect the roots.       

109
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,560
they pick out any debris and discard any dark roots   

110
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,030
that would sully the whiteness of the final product.     

111
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,171
next, the roots travel to the automated grinding system. 

112
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,508
the conveyer belt has built-in scales      

113
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,411
that control how much goes into the grinder at a time.  

114
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,982
the grinder works like a giant food processor.  

115
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,317
while grinding,        

116
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,319
it automatically feeds in a specific amount of vinegar. 

117
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:45,524
this stops the enzyme reaction,
preventing heat from escaping. 

118
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,529
the grinder also automatically adds water and salt brine.   

119
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:54,466
the salt adds flavor and keeps the horseradish from browning. 

120
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,404
next, the horseradish moves into a blender.     

121
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,871
this is where the factory   

122
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,540
adds the extra ingredients for specialty flavors,     

123
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,844
such as fresh cream for cream-style horseradish.  

124
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,815
a pumping system        

125
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,617
transfers it from the blender to a holding tank.       

126
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,354
inside the tank, mixing blades continuously turn

127
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,157
to prevent the ingredients from separating.        

128
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,024
en route to the filling station,

129
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,494
the inside of every single glass container

130
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:26,165
gets a blast of air to blow out any debris.    

131
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,974
the filling process is entirely automated.     

132
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,111
the machine grabs each container,     

133
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,579
aligns it under a nozzle,   

134
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,881
then squirts the horseradish inside.            

135
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,391
the filled containers move on a conveyer       

136
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,827
to the capping machine.    

137
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:59,398
there a spinning head descends,

138
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,334
screwing a plastic cap to the container.       

139
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,110
next, the containers move to the labeler.      

140
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,680
it applies glue to the back of the labels,   

141
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,881
then slaps one on to every container.      

142
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,686
from there, the containers go off to cold storage     

143
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,354
until shipping time --     

144
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:26,424
shipping via refrigerated truck,
of course.           

145
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,428
prepared horseradish has a seven-month shelf life,   

146
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,363
thanks to the vinegar and salt,

147
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,632
which act as natural preservatives.   

148
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,166
those critical ingredients   

149
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,502
maintain the color, flavor, and heat        

150
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,738
until you're ready to eat.   

151
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,324
narrator: industrial steam boilers    

152
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,859
heat water to produce steam  

153
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:04,196
to do such things as sterilize surgical instruments,

154
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:07,099
cook food, and heat or humidify buildings.

155
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,467
they are even used for dry cleaning.        

156
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,137
the water inside an industrial steam boiler   

157
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,040
is heated by natural gas, oil, or electricity.      

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,146
industrial steam boilers    

159
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,615
are usually found deep inside buildings,     

160
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,285
where they inconspicuously create valuable steam and heat.

161
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,758
it starts with a plasma torch 

162
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,894
that cuts holes in a solid sheet of steel.   

163
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,296
the thickness of the steel used

164
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,832
depends on the operating pressure of the boiler.     

165
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,975
using a hydraulic bending machine,  

166
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,711
a worker shapes the metal   

167
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,515
into what will become the inner shell of the boiler. 

168
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:57,915
this inner shell will contain the water     

169
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:02,520
that gets heated inside the boiler to create steam.  

170
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,056
he stops the rolls       

171
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,859
and prepares an edge of the shell for welding.   

172
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,667
he continues shaping the metal to a preset diameter,     

173
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,904
and then he grinds the other edge to prepare it for welding.

174
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,742
the shell shape is now fully formed      

175
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,678
and ready to be welded closed. 

176
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,217
a submerged arc-welding machine

177
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,020
deposits a special granular material  

178
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,422
that protects the weld from air contamination.    

179
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,234
he removes the protective granular material,       

180
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,937
leaving behind a perfect weld. 

181
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,512
next, a worker welds what's called a boiler head  

182
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,813
to the shell.         

183
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,252
he fits steel pipes into the boiler heads     

184
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,355
located at both ends.     

185
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,562
he welds the pipe securely in place.       

186
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,139
workers then insert a combustion
chamber into the shell.    

187
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,607
later, a burner, used to heat the water,    

188
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,878
will be fitted into the combustion chamber.    

189
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,017
a worker then tests the    
fully assembled pressure vessel,

190
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,820
as it's now called.      

191
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,223
he fills the space between the 
combustion chamber and the shell

192
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,025
with water to ensure it doesn't leak.   

193
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,299
workers then wrap the pressure vessel in insulation      

194
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,035
to help the boiler retain heat.

195
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,779
they wrap an outer jacket around the pressure vessel   

196
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,016
and secure it in place using sheet-metal screws.   

197
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,523
all boilers then receive a blower,     

198
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,427
which feeds air into the burner
and the combustion chamber.  

199
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,202
next, a worker attaches    
what is known as a water column.

200
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,405
this apparatus supports various
control devices and sensors,  

201
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,140
as well as a visual indicator 

202
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:38,009
that shows the water level inside the boiler.       

203
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,683
a worker connects the electrical-control panel, 

204
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,786
so he can test the safety and operation of the boiler.  

205
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,631
he powers up the unit and fires the burner      

206
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,568
that is installed inside the combustion chamber. 

207
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,370
he opens a steam-outlet pipe on a test line         

208
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,639
and makes sure all the control devices,    

209
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,243
including the water-level indicator and the blower,   

210
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,178
are working properly.     

211
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,385
this boiler passes the test.  

212
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,922
it generates the correct amount
of heat and steam.       

213
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,866
finally, a worker applies the appropriate labeling    

214
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,001
on every boiler,        

215
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,535
whether it's a smaller unit,  

216
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,738
the type used in a dry-cleaning business,  

217
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,341
or one of the larger boilers  
used in a food-processing plant.

218
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,225
narrator: before bathing became common, 

219
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,095
people used heavy colognes to mask unwanted odor.     

220
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,763
it wasn't until the late 1800s 

221
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,767
that chemists created the first commercial deodorant.

222
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,769
today deodorants are available in a variety of forms,     

223
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,372
from natural alternatives, like body crystals,      

224
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,507
to antiperspirants       

225
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,176
that use chemicals to reduce perspiration.    

226
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,582
almost everyone applies deodorant       

227
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,317
at some point during the day. 

228
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,819
convenient packaging helps make application easy.  

229
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,023
first step to making deodorant --     

230
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,058
mixing up the batch.      

231
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,529
workers pour a blend of    
ingredients into a kettle mixer,

232
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,197
then add powdered wax --    

233
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,001
the main ingredient that holds everything together.

234
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,471
they also add silicone for a smooth texture.      

235
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:51,076
steam heats the mix to 167 degrees fahrenheit,   

236
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,877
melting the ingredients.    

237
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,281
a standard recipe for deodorants
includes wax,         

238
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,751
active ingredients that prevent perspiration,   

239
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,020
dimethicone -- a blending agent,

240
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,589
silicone, and fragrance to mask odors.  

241
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,026
deodorants,          
like all personal-care products,

242
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,963
must meet strict quality-control standards.   

243
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,233
the chemists in this plant's laboratory   

244
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,836
perform a variety of tests   

245
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,805
to ensure their product meets the highest standards.  

246
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,044
to make sure that the product has the right consistency,   

247
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,380
this chemist will perform a viscosity test. 

248
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,450
she stirs a sample at a constant speed,      

249
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,186
then verifies that the force required    

250
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,322
is within the accepted range. 

251
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,462
these containers will dispense the deodorant.  

252
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,265
they're mechanically unscrambled
on a rotating platform     

253
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,236
that sends them spinning into individual pockets.    

254
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,680
sensors overhead detect the ones
that aren't lining up properly. 

255
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,750
a blast of air sends them back onto the platform     

256
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,686
to repeat the process.     

257
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,558
now that they're all right-side-up,         

258
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,828
they move along to the filling station.    

259
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,764
there, a system of levers raises them up         

260
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,101
to align with filling nozzles that dispense the mix.     

261
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:30,508
a system of rotating wheels keeps the containers moving.  

262
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,244
one wheel conveys them to the next for filling,    

263
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,614
and then a third wheel leads them out.        

264
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:49,327
it's best to fill       
using hot mix that flows freely.

265
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,063
but the deodorant must cool in order to harden.      

266
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,866
an overhead rake evenly lines up the containers 

267
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,235
inside a refrigerating tunnel. 

268
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,941
once it's full,        

269
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,612
workers set the cooling system to 14 degrees celsius.     

270
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,082
the deodorant will remain here for several hours.       

271
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,885
next, chemists perform a hardness test    

272
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:17,955
on a cold sample of deodorant. 

273
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,290
a force meter measures     

274
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,293
the amount of pressure required
to crush the sample.      

275
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:29,100
it has to be just right.    

276
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,570
too hard, and the deodorant crumbles without spreading.  

277
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,841
it must be able to flow smoothly

278
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:41,245
out through this perforated dome
that will cover the deodorant. 

279
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,915
each container gets one over at the doming station.  

280
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:49,186
again, a system of revolving wheels works together     

281
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,424
to convey the containers through the station.      

282
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,529
at the center wheel,      

283
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,664
cappers overhead lay the perforated dome    

284
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,734
on top of each one.      

285
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,403
the containers then move to the next station,      

286
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,339
where they each receive a strip of adhesive plastic  

287
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,407
that covers the dome's surface --     

288
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,378
a safety seal that protects the deodorant.  

289
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,549
back to the doming station.  

290
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,085
the containers pass through once more     

291
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,356
as the cappers now snap a plastic cover onto each one. 

292
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:29,360
now they're ready for the final step -- labeling.

293
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,229
the containers roll past a plate

294
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,466
that lifts off adhesive labels from a continuous strip    

295
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,000
and applies them.       

296
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,307
a brush smoothes over the labels.   

297
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,309
that's the final touch.    

298
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,712
now the deodorant is ready for shipping to customers.   

299
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,850
good things do come in small packages of all kinds.
