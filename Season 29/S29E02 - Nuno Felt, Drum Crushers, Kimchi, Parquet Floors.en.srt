narrator: today on "how it's made"...       

5
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,556
nuno felt is an artisan-crafted
non-woven fabric.       

6
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,259
nuno is the japanese word for cloth.        

7
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,127
the technique bonds layers of wool      

8
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,896
and other types of loose fibers

9
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,865
into a lightweight gauzy felt 

10
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,533
with contrasting textures.   

11
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,203
each piece is a unique creation.       

12
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,974
nuno felt is often made into striking       

13
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,810
featherlight pieces of clothing.

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,247
unlike fabrics which are made by weaving thread or yarn,   

15
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,249
nuno felt is made by interlocking        

16
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,251
and compressing fibers.    

17
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,754
the greater the contrast in the texture         

18
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,023
and luster of those different types of fibers,   

19
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,025
the more interesting the design.          

20
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,394
for this project,       

21
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,895
this artisan constructs    

22
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,798
the base of the felt out of merino wool roving,   

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,534
which is wool that's been cleaned,      

24
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,702
processed and dyed.      

25
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,271
she tears off short lengths of fibers       

26
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,608
and lays them down side-by-side,
forming a layer.        

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,312
she lays another layer on top perpendicular to it.  

28
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,914
she builds up three to five layers this way,    

29
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,417
a technique called cross-hatching.     

30
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,586
this process interlaces the fibers,          

31
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,089
strengthening the base of the felt.          

32
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,959
next, she takes pattern silk chiffon fabric      

33
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,863
that color coordinates     
with all the fibers she's using,

34
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,797
cuts out squares and rectangles

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,101
and lays them onto the wool base.      

36
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,670
it's critical to create the right balance of wool   

37
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,406
and non-wool fibers      

38
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,474
so that the wool will be able to grab      

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,778
and hold the layers together to form the nuno felt.     

40
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,381
she adds some mica.      

41
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,616
mica is a shiny natural mineral    

42
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,519
which, in thin flakes like this,   

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,887
is practically weightless.   

44
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,057
sprinkling a bit of mica    

45
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:41,360
onto the surface produces a sequin-like effect.     

46
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,733
the artisan adds some wisps of angelina,    

47
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,035
a shiny, hair-like polyester fiber        

48
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,905
which wool roving easily grabs and holds.    

49
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,975
then she includes some variegated wool yarn,   

50
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,779
which is the term for yarn with a variation of color.   

51
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,616
it adheres to wool roving, silk and angelina.       

52
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,320
and for subtle texture, she lays in wool bouclé.    

53
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,458
bouclé is yarn with continuous tiny loops.  

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,292
once the layout is finished,  

55
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,096
the artisan sprays the materials
with soapy water.       

56
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,466
absorbing water makes the fibers more flexible.   

57
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,402
it also changes the ph level of the wool,       

58
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,871
making it more alkaline,    

59
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:30,709
which triggers the wool fibers to grab the adjacent fibers.  

60
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,612
next, she wraps her design in bubble wrap     

61
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,515
and begins the process of felting the fibers     

62
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,252
with a combination of pressure,
agitation and heat.      

63
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:42,654
first, she presses out trapped air        

64
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,623
with a palm washboard.     

65
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,792
the bubble wrap acts as a cushion,         

66
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,561
preventing the design from distorting.        

67
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,663
the artisan takes a foam cylinder        

68
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,631
and gently rolls up the piece, 

69
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,502
working out any wrinkles as she goes.          

70
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,871
she ties the roll with nylon laces,       

71
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:04,610
then rocks it back and forth from her elbows to her wrists. 

72
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:08,146
she does this a total of 1,000 times.    

73
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,881
at each stop, she unwinds   

74
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:13,519
the roll to smooth out the wrinkles.       

75
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,790
once this process is finished, 

76
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,892
the artisan unwinds the roll to add        

77
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,527
what's called open work or lacework.       

78
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,763
she cuts small slits in the piece       

79
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:29,000
and gently pulls them to form oval openings.     

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,804
the wool is wet, so it stretches easily.    

81
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,809
next, she amps up the agitation

82
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:41,180
by rolling on a series of textured surfaces.     

83
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:44,282
each change of texture hits the piece at different points, 

84
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,819
pushing out the air between the fibers.      

85
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,188
while the wet fibers continue to interlock     

86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,024
and compress with rolling,         

87
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,358
the wool and silk elements   

88
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,961
of the design shrink at different rates,      

89
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,698
producing contrast in the surface texture.    

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,366
by the end, the piece,     

91
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,536
which started out being almost a 1/3 inch think,    

92
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,739
is now just 1/10 inch thick.          

93
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,708
after reshaping some openings,         

94
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,579
she applies the palm washboard one last time.    

95
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,314
then, through the bubble wrap,        

96
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:19,217
the artisan agitates the fibers
with an orbital sander.    

97
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,085
this friction generates heat, 

98
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,555
which further bonds the fibers.

99
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,857
after a final touch-up of the openings,        

100
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,428
she gathers up the felt and gently rinses it in water 

101
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,096
with a bit of vinegar.     

102
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,631
this removes the soap     

103
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,334
which would damage the wool over time.      

104
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,504
the wash also returns the ph to normal,       

105
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:43,509
which closes the fibers and stabilizes the felt.    

106
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,244
after removing as much moisture        

107
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:48,313
as possible by rolling up the felt in a towel,      

108
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,983
she lays it on a counter to air-dry.     

109
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,387
now, this handcrafted nuno felt shawl is poised

narrator: parquet floors are a mosaic of geometric-shaped pieces of wood

306
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,220
that form a repetitive block pattern.  

307
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,789
they date back to the palaces         

308
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,859
and grand homes of 17th century france,

00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,861
where they were welcomed as an easier

to maintain yet still decorative alternative     

311

to the marble floors of the day.          

312
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,769
traditional parquet floor patterns range  

313
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,072
from a simple paving-stone style       

314
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,441
to parquet de versailles,   

315
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,178
the complex pattern of large diagonal squares   

316
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,981
that debuted at france's versailles palace in 1864.   

317
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,284
to produce it,         

318
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,954
manufacturers begin with long planks of oak    

319
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,022
just over an inch thick.    

320
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,459
this particular company produces
only custom orders       

321
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:12,497
and sizes the motif in proportion to the room.   

322
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,066
a worker first measures and marks the dimensions    

323
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,367
of the pattern pieces     

324
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,470
that will be cut from each plank.        

325
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,440
then, with a circular saw,   

326
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:27,078
another worker cuts the required length and width. 

327
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,848
this yields several pieces which, together,        

328
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,484
will form the pattern's crisscrossing rectangles.   

329
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,152
a worker now runs each piece  

330
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,056
through a machine called a molder.        

331
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,992
just one pass does four things.       

332
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,727
it thins the piece to just under an inch,     

333
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,829
squares all the sides,     

334
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,966
smooths all the surfaces,   

335
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,870
and it makes a groove on each side.         

336
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,671
this next machine removes   

337
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,540
an equal amount of wood from the top      

338
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,976
and bottom of one end of the piece          

339
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,577
to form a centered 1/4-inch  

340
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,479
thick projection called a tenon.        

341
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,317
when assembling the pattern,          

342
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,052
the workers will ultimately  

343
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,355
insert tenons into slots in adjoining pieces.      

344
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,125
these slots are called mortises.        

345
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,061
this machine cuts the mortises.         

346
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,031
the floor is an assembly of square panels,       

347
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,534
each one containing a set number
of crisscrossing rectangles  

348
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,503
and diagonal squares within the frame.       

349
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,508
the frame pieces also have tenons and mortises.   

350
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,376
the squares, however, are different.         

351
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:36,847
workers use a router to form a tongue on all four sides.  

352
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,052
the tongue fits into the groove
on the rectangular pieces.   

353
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,488
once the tongues are in the grooves       

354
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,556
and the mortises are in the tenons,       

355
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,625
not a single nail or drop of glue        

356
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,795
will secure those joints.   

357
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,997
they'll be held together the traditional way,      

358
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,832
with oak pegs.         

359

the 43 components fit together          

361
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:06,043
with a few taps of the hammer. 

362
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,146
a pencil mark indicates the nicer side         

363
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,413
of each piece of wood     

364
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,383
so that it can be placed face up.        

365
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:15,453
the tongues of the squares slide

366
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,355
into the grooves of the crisscrossing rectangles, 

367
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,791
which join by mortise and tenon.

368
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,028
the frame pieces attach to each other         

369
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,664
and to the perimeter of the interior assembly,   

370
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,667
also by mortise and tenon.   

371
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,970
a worker now transfers the assembled panel      

372
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,674
to a press which clamps it tightly together.      

373
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,078
next, he drills two holes through each tenon...     

374
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,283
and then hammers a wooden peg through each hole       

375
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,419
to lock the tenon in the mortise.

♪♪         

377
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,162
no one wants their antique-style parquet floor  

378
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,197
to look brand-new.       

379
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,702
so the next step is to lightly sandblast the panel's surface 

380
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,472
to make the wood look worn with time.      

381
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,176
another worker goes over the panel         

382
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,577
with an electric sander    

383
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,647
to soften the surface for the next step,       

384
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,017
which is to randomly scatter some sand and work it in    

385
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:23,620
with the wood block attachment on the sander.   

386
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,890
this process creates and antique appearance     

387
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,393
and worn-in look.       

388
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,467
after brushing off the sand,  

389
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,202
the worker scratches up the surface          

390
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:41,472
with a rotating wire brush.  

391
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,408
the panel now looks like it could be        

392
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,311
from a centuries-old french chateau.        

393
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,047
the last step is to finish the wood.     

394
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,884
first, a coat of stain for color.      

395
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,085
then a coat of oil       

396
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,320
to protect the wood from moisture.         

397
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,689
and finally, a coat of hot wax 

398
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,225
which gives the surface a rich luster.         

399
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,093
these steps also highlight   

400
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,729
the contrasting grains of the wood          

401
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,964
due to certain pieces having been cut        

402
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,567
from the tree horizontally and others vertically.     

403
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,538
this intricacy enhances the timeless beautiful     

404
