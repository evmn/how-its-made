00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,957
         narrator: today        
       on "how it's made,"      

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,494
         robotic arms...        

5
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,066
           tattoos...           

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,705
       sanitary napkins...      

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,210
       and concrete pipes.      

8
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,920
     the term "robot" comes     
  from the czech word "robota," 

9
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,790
   which means "forced labor."  

10
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,126
    most robots are designed    
       for repetitive work      

11
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,195
        that's difficult,       
           dangerous,           

12
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,930
 or would just bore human beings
            to death.           

13
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,867
    robotic arms have varying   
       degrees of freedom,      

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,603
     meaning they can pivot     
       in different ways.       

15
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,943
          a robotic arm         
     resembles a human arm.     

16
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,946
       it has a shoulder,       
 an elbow, a wrist, and a hand. 

17
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,615
    the shoulder is actually    
        a stationary base       

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,751
 to which the rest is attached. 

19
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,154
    an engineer first designs   
  all the parts on a computer.  

20
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,223
        then those plans        
        go into action.         

21
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,025
to form the base's outer casing,

22
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,360
    they bend steel sheeting    
           into shape           

23
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,697
 using a computer-guided press. 

24
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,433
   next they paint the casing   
        in powder paint,        

25
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,434
 using an electrostatic process 

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,237
         that guarantees        
     a thorough, even coat.     

27
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,107
       they run a negative      
 electrical charge to the casing

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,777
      and a positive charge     
     to the paint particles.    

29
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:56,648
   this makes the casing draw   
 the paint to it like a magnet. 

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,117
   once the paint on the base   
          casing dries,         

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,652
  they use silk-screen printing 

32
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,455
     to apply what's called     
       the "user diagram."      

33
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,025
 it illustrates which parts move
         where and how.         

34
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:14,600
now they build the robotic arm's
 hand, called the end effector. 

35
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:18,002
     robots can be outfitted    
with all sorts of end effectors.

36
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,804
 here they're making a gripper, 

37
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,275
  whose two claws come together 
   to grasp and carry objects.  

38
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,876
       to make each claw,       

39
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,346
 an automated metal drill cuts a
 groove lengthwise and widthwise

40
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,550
     in a piece of aluminum.    

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,819
          they assemble         
  the electrical circuit board  

42
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,753
         that will later        
       go inside the base.      

43
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,624
 the robotic arm's six separate 
    motors will plug into it.   

44
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,765
     next they assemble the     
  mechanical parts of the base. 

45
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,701
         first the motor        
   that makes the arm rotate,   

46
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,304
   then the gear that goes on   
       the vertical shaft       

47
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,973
holding the robotic arm upright.

48
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,642
      when the motor makes      
  the gear and the shaft turn,  

49
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,512
 the robotic arm turns with it. 

50
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,313
  at the arm's shoulder level,  

51
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,783
      they install a system     
        of four pulleys.        

52
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:08,119
  each consists of two plastic  
    wheels on a separate axle   

53
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,457
   with a rubber belt running   
between them like a clothesline.

54
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,928
    the belt has little teeth   
that grip grooves on the wheels.

55
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,164
     it rotates the wheels,     
  making the robotic arm move.  

56
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,934
  each joint in the robotic arm 

57
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,338
is capable of and programmed for
  a specific range of movement. 

58
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,606
       like the human arm,      

59
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,675
         the combination        
       of these movements       

60
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,710
  manipulates the end effector. 

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,679
  they plug an electrical wire  

62
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,348
     that links the gripper     
         to the shoulder        

63
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,618
      into a circuit board      
    located in the shoulder.    

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,821
 then they screw the entire arm 
          to the base.          

65
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,691
   they link up the wires from  
  the circuit board in the base 

66
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,959
 to the motors in the shoulder. 

67
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,030
 to do this, they have to bunch 
 the wires, 48 of them in total,

68
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,632
         and thread them        
        through the shaft       

69
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,435
          that attaches         
      the base to the arm.      

70
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,770
  once everything's connected,  

71
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,907
     they fine-tune and test    
   the gear and pulley systems  

72
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,909
  to see if they run smoothly.  

73
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,778
      now they can install      
           the gripper          

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,881
  and the shaft and gear system 
        that operates it.       

75
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,989
    turning the gear one way    
         opens the grip.        

76
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,459
    turning it the other way    
           closes it.           

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,464
  now they mount the assembled  
     gripper to the forearm,    

78
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,733
       plugging its motor       
      into a circuit board      

79
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,036
      that they've already      
        installed there.        

80
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,277
       they plug the wires      
       from all six motors      

81
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,811
   into the main circuit board  

82
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,881
    which they then install     
    at the back of the base.    

83
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,752
     the robot controller --    
 the brain that runs the arm -- 

84
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,020
       is a separate unit.      

85
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,957
     it controls everything     
    connected to the circuit.   

86
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,024
       to move the robot,       

87
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,226
          the computer          
      inside the controller     

88
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,162
           switches on          
    all the necessary motors.   

89
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,032
 it can control eight motors -- 

90
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:04,168
        six in the robot        
  and two optional accessories. 

91
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,372
       you can program it       
 to perform a variety of tasks. 

92
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,973
      from start to finish,     

93
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:13,044
 it's taken just under 30 hours 
 to assemble this robotic arm.  

94
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,113
 it can lift up to 10 pounds -- 

95
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,916
        about the weight        
     of a full-grown cat --     

96
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,384
   and it can move at a speed   

97
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,153
        of a little over        
       one mile per hour.       

98
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,592
           most robots          
      are reprogrammable --     

99
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,661
     meaning that to change     
         their behavior,        

100
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,030
 you simply write a new program.

101
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,670
from an employer's perspective, 
robots may be the ideal workers.

102
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,473
   granted, they have no ideas  
          of their own,         

103
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,875
     but their productivity     
          is constant,          

104
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,410
    they never call in sick,    

105
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,013
       and they never take      
     lunch or coffee breaks.    

106
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,025
    narrator: tattooing dates   
      at least as far back      

107
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,760
       as the bronze age.       

108
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,830
      a 5,000-year-old body     
   found in a european glacier  

109
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,965
       had several tattoos      
          on his skin.          

110
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,101
    archaeologists have even    
            uncovered           

111
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,305
 what they believe are stone age
    tattooing instruments --    

112
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,706
       sharp bone needles       

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,476
         and clay disks         
  containing mineral pigments.  

114
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,450
    walk into a tattoo parlor   

115
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,119
     and the vast selection     
      of elaborate designs      

116
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,589
        will astound you.       

117
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,025
   once you make your choice,   

118
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,695
        the tattoo artist       
        traces the image.       

119
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,813
next, he places the traced image
         on carbon paper        

120
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,081
    and re-traces the lines.    

121
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,553
this creates a carbon outline of
the tattoo on the reverse side. 

122
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,889
     the artist will use his    
   blueprint, as it's called,   

123
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,624
          as his guide.         

124
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,768
 he cleans the customer's skin, 

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,238
       then firmly presses      
        on the blueprint.       

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,774
        the carbon image        
        transfers easily        

127
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,910
    because the skin is damp.   

128
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,251
   now it's time to construct   
          the needles.          

129
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,587
      most tattoos require      
         two needles --         

130
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,389
     one to make the outline    
          of the image,         

131
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,624
       the other to shade       
        and color it in.        

132
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,861
    each needle is made up of   
 as many as 20 smaller needles. 

133
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:46,531
     the artist aligns these    
     small needles in a jig,    

134
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,268
   then solders them together   
  onto one end of a steel rod.  

135
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,304
there's an eye on the other end.

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,675
   the number of small needles  
           in a needle          

137
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,610
             depends            
     on the tattoo design --    

138
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:03,248
    how thick the lines are,    
 how big its colored areas are. 

139
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,820
  the finished needles go into  
 an autoclave to be sterilized. 

140
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,289
      that takes 20 minutes     

141
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:15,961
          at precisely          
     338 degrees fahrenheit.    

142
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:19,697
the tattoo artist uses that time
   to assemble the tattoo gun.  

143
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,501
    after cleaning the frame    
      with rubbing alcohol,     

144
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,070
     he installs the motor,     
        called the coil.        

145
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,708
    when an electric current    
     runs through the coil,     

146
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,379
    it oscillates the needle    
  at up to 50 times per second. 

147
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,519
      once the two needles      
         are sterilized,        

148
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,188
 he takes the one for outlining,
        called the liner,       

149
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,458
          and slides it         
      into the tattoo gun.      

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,394
       he hooks the eye on      
 the other end onto the spring. 

151
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,730
       as the spring moves      
         back and forth,        

152
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,932
       it moves the needle      
          up and down.          

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,270
     the tattoo artist stops    
and starts it with a foot pedal,

154
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,372
     like a sewing machine.     

155
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,942
         time to tattoo.        

156
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,410
  he turns on the power supply  
           to 10 volts          

157
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,613
       and dabs the needle      
         in the ink cap.        

158
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:09,948
    the gun sucks up the ink.   

159
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,488
      some petroleum jelly      
           on the skin          

160
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,690
        helps the needle        
       glide more easily.       

161
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,626
 he begins by tracing the lines 
        of the blueprint.       

162
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,428
  the needle punctures the skin 

163
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,097
            at a rate           
of up to 3,000 times per minute,

164
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,232
    injecting micro-particles   
             of ink,            

165
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,769
which intermingle with the cells
         of the dermis,         

166
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,637
    the skin's second layer.    

167
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,906
     the artist continually     
    wipes away the excess ink   

168
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,076
  to keep his work area clean.  

169
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,914
  after finishing the outline,  
  he reapplies petroleum jelly. 

170
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,185
this seals the pores of the skin
     and prevents bleeding.     

171
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,320
         then he changes        
       to the other needle      

172
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,723
       and begins shading       
     and coloring the image     

173
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,025
 with a back-and-forth movement.

174
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,000
 he applies one color at a time,

175
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,670
   overlapping them to ensure   
   thorough and even coverage.  

176
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,607
    the needle can penetrate    
   from .04 to .15 of an inch,  

177
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,410
    and a good tattoo artist    
    knows just how deep to go   

178
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,746
  to create the different parts 
          of the image.         

179
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,749
  for example, he has to inject 
    the outline the deepest,    

180
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,884
       but going too deep       
       can tear the skin        

181
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,219
    and cause excessive pain    
          and bleeding.         

182
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,823
    but not going deep enough   
        misses the dermis       

183
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,992
 and leaves marks after healing.

184
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,567
     the cells of the dermis    
     are remarkably stable,     

185
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,302
   so tattoos last a lifetime.  

186
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,839
      this tattoo has taken     
 approximately 45 minutes to do 

187
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,775
      from start to finish.     

188
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,980
the area will dry and scab over.

189
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,048
  then the scab will fall off,  

190
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,519
        and this body art       
  will be ready for exhibition. 

191
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,530
            narrator:           
       believe it or not,       

192
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,867
world war i led to the invention
of disposable sanitary napkins. 

193
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,669
         american nurses        
        serving in france       

194
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,471
  discovered that the bandages  
    they used for the troops    

195
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,741
 could double as very absorbent 
         menstrual pads.        

196
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,542
  this led the bandage company  

197
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,981
     to introduce disposable    
    sanitary napkins in 1921.   

198
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,289
today's disposable sanitary pads
are made of layers of cellulose,

199
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,026
  combined with super-absorbent 
         polymer powder.        

200
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,362
           polymer is           
   a fluid-absorbing chemical   

201
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,897
       derived from either      
       petroleum or wheat.      

202
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,299
     cellulose is the fiber     

203
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,235
   that makes up the cell wall  
      of trees and plants.      

204
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,570
     it also retains fluid.     

205
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,172
    pulp and paper companies    
      grind and moisten it      

206
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,708
 to form a product called pulp. 

207
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,710
   producing sanitary napkins   

208
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,714
 begins with 20-inch-wide rolls 
       of cellulose pulp.       

209
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,984
 the rolls feed one long machine
      that does everything.     

210
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,921
     first, knives spinning     
     at 3,000 thousand rpm      

211
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,523
         shred the pulp         
       into a fine fluff.       

212
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:09,094
   then the machine sprinkles   
 that fluff with polymer powder.

213
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,333
the polymered fluff then travels
through what's called the doser,

214
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,935
   a device that measures out   

215
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,537
  the required amount of fluff  
         per pad layer.         

216
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:23,942
    the machine then suctions   
 each dose into a closed chamber

217
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,478
  where an air current blows it 
     into a pad-shaped mold.    

218
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,482
    then another air current    
    blows it out of the mold    

219
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:34,285
 onto a wheel that transfers it 
       to a conveyer belt.      

220
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,689
   the machine simultaneously   
   makes a second pad layer.    

221
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,557
      this one is smaller,      
          rectangular,          

222
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,360
       and at least double      
 the density of the first layer,

223
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,364
  meaning it has more cellulose 
 compressed into a smaller size.

224
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,767
     the compression roller     
     also embosses a pattern    

225
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,901
       that will disperse       
       the menstrual flow,      

226
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,303
       helping absorption.      

227
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,974
       this demonstration       

228
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,710
 shows the critical absorption  
 role the polymer powder plays. 

229
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,781
          it can retain         
   up to 40 times its volume.   

230
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,116
     as the polymer soaks up    
           the liquid,          

231
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,487
    it transforms from powder   
             to gel.            

232
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,262
   different types of polymers  
 have different reaction speeds.

233
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,064
        this type absorbs       
        at average speed.       

234
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,067
  this will be a two-layer pad. 

235
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,936
      the number of layers      
        and their weight        

236
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,271
      depends on the degree     
        of menstrual flow       

237
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,407
  a pad is designed to absorb.  

238
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,143
        now the machine's       
      conveyor belts merge,     

239
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,112
     bringing the two layers    
            together.           

240
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,887
 now the machine sandwiches the 
 layers between plastic sheets. 

241
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,622
    the top one is perforated   

242
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,292
    to allow fluid to pass to   
the absorbent layers underneath.

243
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,095
         the bottom one         
  acts as a leak-proof barrier. 

244
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,631
         a roller stamps        
     the contour of the pad,    

245
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,968
  sealing the absorbent layers  
             inside.            

246
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,971
  now the machine applies glue  
        to a paper strip        

247
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,640
     and to a pair of small     
        paper rectangles.       

248
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,109
 it slaps the strip on the back 
           of the pad           

249
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,379
    and the rectangles on the   
  side flaps, called the wings. 

250
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,315
 to secure the pad to underwear,

251
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,384
      you remove the paper      
     to expose the adhesive.    

252
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,256
  the pads are still connected  
         to each other.         

253
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,925
          a cutting die         
        excises each one.       

254
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,127
  abrasive foam on either side  
           of the die           

255
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:27,665
    grips then pulls away the   
 material surrounding the pads. 

256
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,976
       a vacuum then sucks      
        this excess away.       

257
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,015
          now the pads          
  move onto the packaging line. 

258
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,484
 the equipment first folds over 
       the adhesive wings,      

259
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,921
  then folds each pad in three. 

260
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,770
         the folded pads        
    now go into plastic wrap.   

261
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,313
    a hot, iron-like device,    
   called an embossing press,   

262
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,316
        seals the plastic       
        around each pad.        

263
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,518
  then a knife cuts in between  
            the pads,           

264
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,987
         separating them        
    into individual pouches.    

265
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,660
    next, two belts sandwich    
           the pouches          

266
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,861
       and carry them down      
         to the stacker,        

267
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,232
   where an automated counter   
  lines them up for packaging.  

268
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,141
   as a vacuum opens the bag,   

269
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,142
        a mechanical arm        
        inserts the pads.       

270
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,413
          the equipment         
    then seals the bag shut.    

271
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:52,216
 everything you've seen happens 
     at an impressive pace.     

272
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,751
      from start to finish,     

273
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:57,956
it takes just 40 seconds to make
 and package a sanitary napkin. 

274
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,170
   narrator: most underground   
    sewer and drainage pipes    

275
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,906
     are made of reinforced     
        dry-mix concrete.       

276
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,441
 "reinforced" refers to the fact

277
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,576
          the concrete          
    has steel bars inside it    

278
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,644
 for added structural strength. 

279
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,314
  "dry-mix" refers to the type  
          of concrete.          

280
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,983
         you can mold it        
  then immediately extract it,  

281
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,819
     and it holds its shape.    

282
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,392
      concrete pipes can be     
      as small as 10 inches     

283
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,194
   or as large as 11 1/2 feet.  

284
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,597
it has a hundred-year life span.

285
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,665
        dry-mix concrete        
        is made of stone,       

286
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,667
          coarse sand,          
       portland cement --       

287
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,870
 which is a finely-ground blend 
    of clay and limestone --    

288
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,608
      water, and a chemical     
  that acts as a water reducer. 

289
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,748
trucks unload the sand and stone
   into outdoor storage bins.   

290
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,084
the materials automatically drop
      onto a conveyor belt      

291
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:04,555
which transports them to storage
 silos above the factory floor. 

292
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,824
       the cement arrives       
       by cement tanker,        

293
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,692
   which blows it into a silo.  

294
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,295
  all the silos feed the mixer. 

295
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,830
    as the ingredients blend,   

296
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,566
      the cement and water      
     combine to form a paste    

297
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,902
 that coats the sand and stone. 

298
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,971
 the water reducer enables them 
      to use minimal water.     

299
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,442
  the less water, the stronger  
 and more durable the concrete. 

300
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,512
           meanwhile,           
  workers use a special machine 

301
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,313
     to build what's called     
           the cage --          

302
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,581
     a circular steel frame     

303
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,717
    that will form the pipe's   
       internal structure,      

304
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,118
          its backbone.         

305
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,121
     they insert 8-foot-long    
           steel rods           

306
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,323
  in a circular configuration,  

307
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,327
pushing each rod partway through
 the machine to the other side. 

308
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:48,265
 there, an automated spot-welder
 fuses a steel cable to one rod.

309
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,534
then the machine begins turning,

310
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,538
    winding the cable tightly   
        around the rods.        

311
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,540
    here a worker is turning    
      the machine manually      

312
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,077
   just to show us the process  
         in slow-motion.        

313
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,614
   this is what it looks like   
 at the normal automated speed. 

314
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,685
           as the rods          
    pass through the machine,   

315
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,355
 the welder fuses the cable to  
 them in one continuous spiral. 

316
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,563
      as the spiraled cable     
  reaches the end of the rods,  

317
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,797
       the machine's claws      
         spread outward,        

318
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,967
     forming a wider section    
           on the end.          

319
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,303
         this is called         
        the bell section.       

320
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,841
       workers position it      
         on a base ring         

321
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,044
    designed to hold the cage   
            in place.           

322
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,113
    then they close a hinged    
       steel mold over it.      

323
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,582
    now they're ready to pour   
          the concrete.         

324
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,518
 a forklift transports the mold 

325
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,987
       to a machine called      
        the packer head.        

326
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,857
     they position the mold     
       directly under it.       

327
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,731
    a long, drill-like screw    
    descends into the mold.     

328
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,132
      as concrete pours in,     

329
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,402
 the screw turns at high speed, 
       moving up and down.      

330
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:02,472
 its blades propel the concrete 
 outward against the mold walls,

331
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,342
        forming the pipe.       

332
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,846
     this process is called     
 centrifugal projection forming.

333
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,623
     the process for making     
      large-diameter pipes      

334
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,025
     is slightly different.     

335
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,295
    a welder fuses spacers to   
 the cage, both inside and out. 

336
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,365
   these will center the cage   
        inside the mold.        

337
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,435
    workers position the cage   
        onto a base ring,       

338
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,504
    then lower the outer part   
         of the mold --         

339
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,573
   called the outside form --   
            over it.            

340
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,245
 after securing it to the ring, 

341
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,514
    they lower the unit over    
the smaller, inner part of mold,

342
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,718
     called the inside form.    

343
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,524
       an overhead funnel       
         pours concrete         

344
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,161
         into the cavity        
   between the two mold forms.  

345
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,468
  powerful electrical vibrators 
         shake the mold.        

346
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,073
 this forces the thick concrete 
 downward, filling the cavity.  

347
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,909
     this process is called     
       vibration forming.       

348
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,013
           with either          
     pipe-forming technique,    

349
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,215
       the molded concrete      
        is quite fragile,       

350
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,219
     so the molds go off to     
 the curing warehouse to harden.

351
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,687
   there, workers remove them,  

352
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,490
        leaving the pipes       
        standing upright.       

353
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:39,704
steam hoses transform the curing
     warehouse into a sauna.    

354
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,174
      the temperature rises     
   to 140 degrees fahrenheit,   

355
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,376
   the relative humidity 100%.  

356
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:49,513
      the concrete hardens      
       in about 12 hours.       

357
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,716
         concrete pipes         
       buried underground       

358
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,986
have to be able to withstand the
weight of the earth above them, 

359
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:58,522
 so the company subjects sample 
    pipes to extreme pressure   

360
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,124
          to test their         
       maximum resistance.      

361
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,663
  concrete pipes join together  
 with watertight rubber gaskets.

362
