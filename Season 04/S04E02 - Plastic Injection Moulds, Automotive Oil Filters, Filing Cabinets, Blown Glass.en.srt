00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,254
narrator: if you take a closer 
look at the products around you,

4
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,190
you'll notice that many are made of parts  

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,460
that have been assembled together.      

6
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,929
one way factories make product parts       

7
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,799
is by melting material such as metal, rubber, or plastic, 

8
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,702
then pouring or injecting them into molds.          

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,609
to make a plastic part for a product,         

10
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,746
the manufacturer has to first 
commission a mold-making company

11
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,349
to design and produce a plastic-injection mold.   

12
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,824
the mold begins as bars of chromium steel,   

13
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,093
a highly durable metal that can withstand       

14
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,430
repeated high-pressure injection
of plastic.          

15
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,902
workers assemble several bars 
into a block called a mold base.

16
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,772
they mount this base on a milling machine,     

17
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,574
which shaves the bars to the right dimension.    

18
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:54,046
this step is critical, enabling
them to later machine the base 

19
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,516
into a mold that's true to the technical design,    

20
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,285
right down to the hundredth of a millimeter. 

21
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,324
a mold usually consists of two halves,         

22
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,395
each of which is comprised of several components.     

23
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,998
the factory drills strategically
positioned holes in each base 

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,734
for the guide pins and bushings

25
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,536
that hold the components together    

26
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,939
when the plastic's injected.  

27
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,540
a grinder now goes to work,  

28
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,743
smoothing and leveling all surfaces.   

29
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,212
this prepares the base     

30
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,615
for the high-precision machining operations      

31
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:32,184
that will transform it into a mold component.     

32
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,822
a computer-guided tooling machine called the cnc 

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,759
slowly machines the base,   

34
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,562
wearing away the steel, particle by particle,     

35
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,431
to create the mold-component shape.   

36
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,033
this one, part of a mold    

37
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,570
for the plastic rim around a snowmobile's front headlight,

38
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:55,040
takes 20 hours to complete.  

39
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,242
from here, most mold components

40
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,578
go on to a second tooling machine,   

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,314
especially if they require fine detailing         

42
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:06,785
that this cnc machine isn't capable of carving.   

43
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,121
the second machine is outfitted

44
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,857
with a copper electrode in the shape of the plastic part, 

45
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,393
in this case, a snowmobile oil gauge.    

46
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,864
after polishing the electrode to ensure flawless casting,  

47
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,199
they use a sophisticated measuring device        

48
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,801
to verify the dimensions.   

49
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,542
the electrode goes facedown  

50
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,678
on the second tooling machine, called the edm.        

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
directly underneath is the mold half        

52
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,418
that's been partially formed on the first machine.     

53
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,887
a strong electric current runs through the electrode     

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,556
and penetrates the mold,    

55
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,426
forming a cavity in the shape of the electrode.       

56
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,098
after tooling, they drill coolant lines.   

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,367
this is for the cooling fluid they'll use 

58
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,837
to accelerate the hardening of the molten plastic.     

59
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,373
some plastic product parts,  

60
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,843
like that snowmobile oil gauge we saw earlier,        

61
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,978
have lettering on them.    

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,249
the factory engraves the letters
in reverse           

63
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,116
inside the mold cavity.    

64
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,952
after the plastic's injected, 

65
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,688
the writing is right-side out and raised.          

66
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,527
this surface of the mold cavity

67
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,796
is pretty rough from all that tooling,     

68
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:30,535
so they polish it smooth to ensure proper casting.   

69
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:34,940
here's what the two halves of a finished mold look like. 

70
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,941
the pins and bushings fit together          

71
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,210
to close the mold       

72
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,145
before injecting the hot liquid plastic.    

73
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:45,016
once the plastic cools and hardens,       

74
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,087
it's just a matter of extracting
the molded plastic part.    

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,291
here's a different molding method --        

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,094
a two-step process they're using to make buttons 

77
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,698
that go on the steering handle of a jet ski.         

78
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:12,077
first, they mold a structural 
base out of hard, white plastic.

79
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,981
then, they put the base into a second mold       

80
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,551
and inject a rubberlike gray plastic.         

81
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,121
this softer plastic      

82
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,657
covers everything but the raised lettering,   

83
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,826
giving the button a softer feel.

84
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,129
factories also make molds   

85
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,865
for aluminum injection and rubber injection,      

86
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,734
among other materials.     

87
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,603
they build those molds from different types of metal 

88
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,173
but using the same techniques. 

89
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,416
narrator: changing your car's oil filter a couple of times a year    

90
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:55,086
is an easy way to prolong the life of your engine.    

91
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,689
the oil pump forces oil through the filter       

92
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,025
to the moving parts in the engine.         

93
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,294
the filter's job is to block dirt and metal debris 

94
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,132
from getting in between those 
parts and causing engine damage.

95
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,507
they make many oil-filter parts
from steel coil --       

96
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,776
a sheet of steel on a roll.  

97
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,778
they start by unwinding the roll

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,314
and feeding the coil into a press.         

99
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,851
the press contains a series of dies,        

100
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,720
each of which progressively stamps the steel 

101
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,124
into the shape of the specific part they're making.      

102
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,460
this press is churning out tapping plates,        

103
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,796
a component on the end of the oil filter  

104
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,332
that screws onto the car's engine.       

105
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,938
hot off the press, the tapping plates       

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,943
travel on a magnetic conveyer to the welding station.    

107
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:56,047
there, a robotic arm loads them
onto the welding carrousel.  

108
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,019
but before any welding begins, 

109
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:06,290
a nozzle applies sealant around the rim of each plate. 

110
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,262
this will fill any gaps left  
between the parts after welding.

111
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,365
a robot now welds the tapping plate  

112
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,902
to another steel part called the bottom ring.    

113
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,704
this ring will hold the gasket,

114
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,507
the rubber seal that prevents oil from leaking out      

115
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,711
as it travels through the filter
into the engine.        

116
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,480
the welded parts, known as the bottom assembly, 

117
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,249
now go onto a machine     

118
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,252
that cuts a thread pattern through the center.      

119
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:39,324
this will enable the oil filter
to be screwed onto the engine. 

120
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:43,127
another press produces the oil filter's steel body,  

121
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,729
called the cannister.     

122
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,934
the dies first stamp out a rough cannister shape.    

123
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,337
then, they reduce the diameter and make the can taller.    

124
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,506
finally, they cut off the excess.    

125
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,210
elsewhere in the factory, another machine        

126
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,147
cuts and perforates pieces of tin-plated steel coil

127
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,549
and rolls them into tubes.   

128
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,486
we'll see where those tubes go shortly. 

129
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,357
yet another machine prepares the filter's key component -- 

130
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,293
a filter paper that works like a fine sieve, 

131
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:19,364
trapping dirt, carbon, and soot.

132
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,300
first, the machine pleats the paper  

133
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,370
so it will fit inside the cannister.     

134
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,244
next, the machine cuts     

135
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:36,047
the continuous ribbon of pleated paper into lengths. 

136
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,182
it folds each piece into a circle,         

137
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,253
fastening the ends with a steel clip.       

138
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,788
the next machine assembles   

139
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,057
what's called the filter cartridge.     

140
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,728
it places each filter paper over a tube.          

141
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,797
the tube's job is to reinforce the paper   

142
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,700
against the force of the oil pumping through it. 

143
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,071
this machine glues a capping disk      

144
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,274
on each end of the filter paper      

145
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,676
to hold the tube in place.   

146
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,949
a heater cures the glue.    

147
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,823
now for the final assembly.  

148
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,826
as the cannisters go by upside down,          

149
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:26,064
automated arms insert the filter cartridges.     

150
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,171
a worker then puts a thin, rubber disk      

151
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,906
on top of each cartridge.   

152
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,678
this disk will prevent the oil 
from draining out of the filter.

153
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,384
now for those bottom assemblies
we saw them making earlier.  

154
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,321
a worker positions one on each cannister.     

155
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,060
then, a machine called a seamer folds its edge down, 

156
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:01,266
forming a rim,         
just like the rim of a soup can.

157
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,269
now the conveyer turns the filters right-side up,   

158
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,272
as they file by five nozzles spraying powder paint.     

159
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,811
an infrared oven dries the paint
in about 90 seconds.      

160
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:18,549
then, a printing machine stamps
on the product information.  

161
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,819
the conveyer now turns the filters upside down again, 

162
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,289
as they travel to the gasket inserter.    

163
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,427
its automated plungers insert a gasket into each bottom ring.

164
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,865
these automotive oil filters are finally finished      

165
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,635
and ready to do the dirty work.

166
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,510
narrator: whether you work in a sprawling corporate office

167
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,912
or in a home office,      

168
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,315
filing cabinets are an essential component   

169
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,584
of an efficient workplace.   

170
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,121
they keep your paperwork tidy, organized, and out of sight,  

171
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,456
yet just a drawer away.    

172
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,191
and when you're short on space,

173
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,827
they make a handy counter for the coffee maker.     

174
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,803
filing cabinets begin as sheets of cold rolled steel,

175
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:16,340
a thin type of metal that's easy
to bend, weld, and paint.   

176
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,609
as the sheet comes off the roll,

177
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,947
it goes through a straightening
machine that removes the curve,

178
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,348
then, into a press,      

179
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,218
whose dies punch out the shape of the specific part,

180
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,089
complete with holes, slots, and embossments.        

181
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:36,293
a filing cabinet is made up of over 60 steel parts.    

182
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,829
for the top-selling models,  

183
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:43,168
the factory has dies specially 
designed to punch out each part.

184
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,969
but that's too costly a system 

185
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,438
for models that aren't mass-produced.   

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,641
to make low-volume or custom-made filing cabinets,

187
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,643
the factory uses        

188
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,179
this computer-controlled punching machine.       

189
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,787
this equipment operates at a far slower speed     

190
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,189
than the presses we just saw, 

191
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,124
but the advantage is that it can be programmed   

192
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,995
to punch out any size, shape, or design,           

193
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,164
no matter how complex.     

194
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:25,076
several filing-cabinet parts are
designed to be bent into shape. 

195
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,881
workers do that manually, using
a machine called a press brake.

196
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,019
this particular part will become
the top of the filing cabinet, 

197
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,556
so they're making downward folds
along the perimeter      

198
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,558
to create 1 1/2-inch-wide edges

199
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,962
with strong and tight corner seams.    

200
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,640
this machine is called a dedicated bender  

201
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,309
because it only bends one type of part --      

202
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,779
the filing-cabinet doors.   

203
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:05,182
the factory produces doors in such high volume      

204
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:10,121
that it pays to design     
a special machine to shape them.

205
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,931
the doors are also bent downward
along the perimeter      

206
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,502
to create edges half-an-inch wide with tight corner seams. 

207
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,940
the cabinet's base is welded  

208
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:33,010
from the same type of steel sheeting as the other parts.  

209
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,747
small steel reinforcements make it rigid enough      

210
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,618
to support the excessive weight
of file-filled drawers.    

211
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,354
to join the cabinet's side and back,         

212
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,224
robots perform what's called "resistance welding,"     

213
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,993
fusing metal using heat from an electric current.   

214
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,230
the next set of robots     

215
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,833
welds the side and back unit to the cabinet top.      

216
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,301
after this,          

217
00:13:56,303 --> 00:14:00,038
workers attach the base using what's called "mig welding" -- 

218
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,773
welding that adds extra metal along the joint        

219
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,243
to create a strong seam.    

220
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,178
once again, it doesn't pay   

221
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,981
to invest in robotic welding equipment  

222
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,650
for models that aren't mass-produced.   

223
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,052
they manually weld low-volume items        

224
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:20,057
such as those small filing cabinets that roll under desks.

225
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,459
in the paint department, rotary atomizers        

226
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,529
envelop the filing cabinets in a mist of paint       

227
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,200
that contains a synthetic resin
for durability.        

228
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,936
these atomizers lace the paint particles    

229
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,138
with a negative electric charge.

230
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,076
this draws the particles to a 
positive charge on the cabinets,

231
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,280
creating a thorough and even coat.         

232
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,349
after 20 minutes in an oven to bake the paint,       

233
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,884
assembly can begin.      

234
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,621
ball-bearing sliders on which the drawers will sit, 

235
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,025
tracks for the fold-down doors,
and doorstops,         

236
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,295
so the doors can't be pulled off their tracks.    

237
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,165
there's also a locking system 

238
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,235
that simultaneously bolts both sides of each door,    

239
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,938
making the files inside inaccessible.         

240
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,313
the last step is to install the doors and drawers     

241
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,917
using a rubber mallet, so as not to damage the finish.

242
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,921
each drawer can support up to 200 pounds of files.   

243
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,925
an interlock system lets you open only one drawer at a time.

244
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,296
this prevents the cabinet from toppling forward.     

245
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,939
narrator: a glassblower    

246
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,674
can transform a sizzling blob of molten glass        

247
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,342
into sheer sculpture      

248
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,213
or objects that are both functional and decorative.

249
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:53,150
blowing glass can be on the cutting edge of modern design, 

250
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,088
quite a feat for an art that's more than 2,000 years old.   

251
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,566
the first hollow glass objects date back to 1,500 b.c.    

252
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,036
the invention of the blowpipe around 30 b.c.         

253
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,105
revolutionized the craft.   

254
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:18,376
until then, objects were either
carved from solid glass blocks 

255
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,045
or molded from molten glass.  

256
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,249
the blowpipe enabled glassmakers
to expand and shape glass.   

257
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,586
it made fast, inexpensive production possible.      

258
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,856
this meant that everyday items,
not just luxuries,       

259
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,657
could now be made of glass,  

260
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,629
accessible not just to the rich 
but to the ordinary people, too.

261
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,476
when you see these spectacular shapes and colors,       

262
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,145
it's hard to believe that blown glass        

263
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,281
comes from this bland, clumpy stuff.   

264
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:01,219
this is silica, a natural material derived from sand,  

265
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,921
mixed with thinners and stabilizers,        

266
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,957
such as potassium and limestone.         

267
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,161
the glassblower recycles any leftover, colorless glass 

268
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,431
then loads the mix into the melting furnace.   

269
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,504
after 12 hours at fusion temperature,     

270
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,306
2,200 degrees fahrenheit,   

271
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,111
the raw material transforms into colorless liquid glass.  

272
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,714
the glassblower uses a blowpipe,

273
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,717
a long steel tube with a ring or pear-shaped end 

274
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,919
to collect what's called a gather,    

275
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:39,523
a glob of this red-hot molten material.    

276
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,991
to color the gather,      

277
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,529
she quickly rolls it in finely ground colored glass.

278
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:48,599
at this stage, the glass is honey-like in consistency, 

279
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,269
though it's cooling and thickening by the second. 

280
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,671
she fuses the color layer   

281
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,007
by reheating the glass for a few seconds       

282
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,143
in a smaller furnace called a glory hole.      

283
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,615
next, she rolls the glass against a ladle-shaped block  

284
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,485
to form a starting shape for blowing.          

285
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:14,492
a gentle blow or two bulges it into a hollow bubble.

286
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,160
by now, the cooling glass   

287
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,496
has thickened to the consistency of caramel, 

288
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,899
making it more controllable and shapable.         

289
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,169
the glassblower stretches and shapes the glass      

290
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,105
with different blocks and hand tools.        

291
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,041
now the glass is like hardened caramel,   

292
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,578
and it will hold its final shape.        

293
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,848
she scores the glass where it meets the blowpipe,  

294
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,450
then cools it down further with compressed air.      

295
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,921
on the opposite end of the glass, with a bit of hot glass,

296
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:49,393
she attached a solid-metal   
maneuvering rod called a pontil.

297
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,330
then she applies a single drop of cold water on the score line

298
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,001
to break the glass off the blowpipe.        

299
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,735
using another pontil,     

300
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,206
she plugs the resulting hole with hot glass.        

301
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,542
then, it's back to the melting furnace to attach a gather.  

302
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,279
it's critical to always rotate the glass   

303
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,616
so that it doesn't droop and become lopsided.      

304
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,951
the glassblower shapes this gather,      

305
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,020
not with a block, but by hand. 

306
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,090
she protects herself from the intense heat     

307
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,626
by using a thick stack of soggy newspapers.      

308
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:31,235
using an ordinary pair of scissors, she forms ridges. 

309
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,445
then, she twists the ridges to spiral them.        

310
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,115
she cools and hardens the finished design      

311
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,117
using compressed air.     

312
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,253
then, it's a quick blast into the glory hole      

313
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,723
to equalize the temperature throughout the piece.     

314
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,992
this blown-glass lemon reamer 

315
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,195
has taken all of eight minutes to make. 

316
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,066
now it goes into an electric  
kiln for a slow 12-hour cooldown

317
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,536
to prevent cracking.      

318
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,339
meanwhile, the glassblower starts a new piece --     

319
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,075
a large vase.         

320
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,810
more blowing, more shaping.  

321
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,279
then, while her co-worker blows air           

322
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,082
to expand the glass and thin it out,        

323
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:22,687
she cools the vase's bottom with wet newspapers.      

324
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,288
this holds the shape      

325
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,758
while she scores the cutoff point at the top.  

326
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,361
after reheating the glass to resoften it,        

327
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,031
they stretch it, lengthening the vase.     

328
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,500
once they finalize the shape, 

329
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:41,572
they use a wooden paddle to flatten the base.      

330
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,775
now for some eye-catching decoration --   

331
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:49,180
vivid colored glass coiled   
like taffy over the entire vase.

332
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,049
certain designs require    

333
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,719
cutting off a portion of the finished piece.     

334
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,920
that leaves a rough, opaque edge

335
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,724
they must extensively grind and polish.          

336
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:08,399
a lemon reamer, a vase, even a mortar and pestle --  

337
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,069
a glassblower's work is clearly remarkable.     

338
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,942
