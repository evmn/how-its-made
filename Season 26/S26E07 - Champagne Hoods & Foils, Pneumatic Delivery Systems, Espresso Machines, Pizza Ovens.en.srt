00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,321
narrator: champagne toasts are common at weddings,     

4
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,258
birthdays, and many other special occasions,        

5
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,493
but if the cork isn't secured properly,     

6
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,663
it can pop off at the wrong moment.       

7
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:07,533
so champagne manufacturers   
have developed hoods and foils  

8
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,603
to keep the bottles       
closed until the right moment.  

9
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:17,076
the foil covering        
that protects the cork is part  

10
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,745
of the iconic champagne look.  

11
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,815
unwrapping it is like opening a special present.        

12
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,351
underneath the foil is a wire hood and disk     

13
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:31,490
that keeps everything in place.             

14
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:35,161
the flat disks         
begin as thin sheets of steel.  

15
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,763
a suctioning device transfers the sheets       

16
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,167
to a printing machine.      

17
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:44,570
the machine slices the sheets into strips.           

18
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,039
then, the suctioning device moves the strips         

19
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:51,377
to the next step in the production line.     

20
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,446
it positions the strips on a machine           

21
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,782
that quickly punches out the round disk components.    

22
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,791
the wire hoods are made out of galvanized steel.     

23
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,994
a series of large bobbins feed the steel          

24
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,128
into a multiphase machine.    

25
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,398
the wire is coated with colored lacquer       

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,469
for increased protection and aesthetic appeal.      

27
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,141
on a rotating carousel,     

28
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,610
the machine twists two horizontal strands of wire.   

29
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,813
it leaves enough room for a vertical loop       

30
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,716
between each set of twists.   

31
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,290
next, the device twists the vertical loop.    

32
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,894
a blade cuts the wire in between each newly formed cross.             

33
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,166
then, a mechanism removes the crosses       

34
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:53,172
and transfers them to the next stage of production.           

35
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:57,576
a machine shapes the bottom   
of the crosses in three steps.  

36
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,978
first, it pinches the wire    

37
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,180
together at the four extremities.     

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,184
then, it forms a bend.      

39
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,187
and finally, it folds them over to create a hook.        

40
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,393
a device folds the feet up    

41
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:19,265
and hooks them onto a wire circle called a belt.      

42
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:23,602
the wire structures       
are ready for the disk insert.  

43
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,871
a press forces the disks into a die            

44
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,674
to create rounded caps.     

45
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,409
finally, the machine inserts the newly formed caps  

46
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,013
into the wire structure.     

47
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,549
the champagne wire hoods     

48
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,487
are now complete and ready for their bottles.        

49
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,690
it takes 15 steps to build a wire hood.      

50
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,224
incredibly,           

51
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,297
the machine can build each hood in under 2 seconds.       

52
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,300
the wire hood holds the cork in place,            

53
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,234
but the polylaminate foil wrapper             

54
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,370
protects it from the elements.  

55
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,374
this specially made foil is composed of polythene film  

56
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,811
sandwiched between two sheets of aluminum.           

57
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,784
a high-speed cutter trims the edges.         

58
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,054
then, the polylaminate rolls through a bath of varnish.            

59
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,626
the polythene film is made out of granules.     

60
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,132
they dye the polylaminate gold  

61
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:30,336
using              
a high-speed printing process.  

62
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:34,340
the polylaminate foil is coated with specially formulated ink  

63
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:39,311
that dries instantly under ultraviolet light.     

64
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:45,417
the foil transfers to a perforation machine.    

65
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,290
this allows customers to easily unwrap the champagne bottle.   

66
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,824
a hot stamping machine      

67
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:58,363
adds decorative elements and the brand name to the foil.              

68
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:03,569
another device adds a strip of glue to one edge.       

69
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,704
a machine cuts the foil,     

70
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,107
then a device equipped with cylindrical rods,      

71
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:12,645
called mandrels, wraps the foil into cones.    

72
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:16,649
the glue strip holds the cone together.     

73
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:21,720
a machine places a disk on top of the cones.       

74
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:25,457
they crimp the ends to increase the cone's rigidity.            

75
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,927
then, a vacuum sucks the completed cones    

76
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,462
off the mandrels.        

77
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:35,133
no bottle of bubbly is complete without a hood and foil.     

78
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,003
this factory quickly pr                

79
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,474
or color the winery requests.  

80
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,878
the factory's speed and versatility allows them   

81
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,015
to produce wire hoods and foils             
for 50% of the sparkling wines  

82
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,284
made in france.         

83
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,434
narrator: pneumatic tubes    

84
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,238
were originally used to transfer            
money and sensitive documents.  

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,975
today, these systems have a different purpose.    

86
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,045
hospitals use them to quickly transport blood samples     

87
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,513
to their labs.          

88
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,782
for patients who need a quick diagnosis,   

89
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,652
these pipelines are a lifeline.            

90
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,591
many hospitals have a series   

91
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:36,795
of pneumatic pipes running behind their walls.   

92
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,999
health care workers seal medical samples in capsules            

93
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,134
and put them in the system.   

94
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,537
these pipelines can be several miles long.    

95
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,208
a computer allows users to monitor the capsule's movement.            

96
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,345
compressed air instantly pushes the capsules through the tubing.             

97
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:57,750
they arrive at the lab in seconds.           

98
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:02,754
the building process starts with the send-and-receive unit.              

99
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,223
a worker glues tubes to a plate.             

100
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,627
both are made of plastic to reduce static.        

101
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,964
he slides the tubes through holes in the top     

102
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:15,033
of the unit's metal housing.   

103
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,703
he places more tubing inside the housing,       

104
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:23,041
then installs the track.     

105
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,578
the tubing slides back and forth on the track to shift      

106
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,983
between send and receive mode.  

107
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,118
he screws a bracket to the box.              

108
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,723
it contains a motor for the sliding mechanism.    

109
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,659
then, he places the unit in an upright position.     

110
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,996
he connects the motor to a power source to test it.  

111
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,798
he confirms that the motor moves the plastic chutes     

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,070
back and forth smoothly.     

113
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,807
the worker connects an air source to the system       

114
00:07:54,809 --> 00:08:00,012
to verify that the seals and vents work properly.     

115
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:01,747
at the next station,       

116
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,484
a technician removes the temporary door.   

117
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:09,054
then, he wires the motor to the electrical power source.             

118
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,194
he bundles the wires and trims the plastic ties.   

119
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:24,036
he screws the computerized control panel to the door.    

120
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,040
then, he reattaches the door.  

121
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,109
the technician wires the control panel        

122
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,344
and verifies that it works.   

123
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,784
then, he connects the computer  

124
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,821
in the send-and-receive unit to one in a diverter unit.    

125
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:49,361
he confirms that the two computers communicate.      

126
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,934
each pneumatic delivery system has several diverters.      

127
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,804
they allow the medical capsules to turn a corner         

128
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:03,942
or change direction to reach their final destination.     

129
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,211
he installs a gear and motor.  

130
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,279
then, he tests the movement of the pipe           

131
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,949
from one outlet to the next.   

132
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:15,621
if everything works properly, he screws the back panel on.   

133
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,624
then, they connect the diverter and other transfer units     

134
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,693
to tubing in the walls of the hospital.         

135
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,363
next, they make the delivery capsules.            

136
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:28,100
a worker places the plastic body in a machine.          

137
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,301
he activates it,         

138
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,237
and the machine spins a cap onto the body.          

139
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:38,042
the spinning also generates heat, which fuses the two parts.             

140
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,181
he slides the capsule onto a post to keep it in place.             

141
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:45,984
then, he hooks one end of a spring to the lid framework            

142
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,053
and the other end to the sliding lid.       

143
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:57,863
he screws the sliding lid to the framework.        

144
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:02,267
now, the lid easily snaps open and shut.   

145
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:10,074
he places a rubber casing onto the end           

146
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:14,078
and stretches a rubber gasket around the rim.         

147
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,948
he wraps fabric bands around both ends.        

148
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,351
this helps buffer the capsule during the journey        

149
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,154
through the pipeline.      

150
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:26,892
he tucks the bands into the rims using a screwdriver.       

151
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,030
he installs plastic bumpers inside.             

152
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,233
they help cushion any blows to the capsule          

153
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:39,438
and its contents during the ride through the pipeline.      

154
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,909
this capsule is now ready for a test run.         

155
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:48,714
the technician inserts it in the shoot and programs the path.              

156
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:52,317
he opens the door to monitor its progress.     

157
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,587
the tubes slide over to collect the capsule   

158
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,124
and then slide back to drop it into the main pipeline.     

159
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,461
compressed air blows it through the system.       

160
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,929
it zips through the pipes    

161
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,799
and arrives safely at its final destination.    

162
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,817
narrator: in the 1880s,     

163
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,021
italians developed special machines to make espresso.    

164
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,522
as the name implies,       

165
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,560
this coffee drink can be produced in seconds.   

166
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:38,363
soon, the appeal of this quick brew expanded beyond italy,   

167
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,367
and today, espresso       
is enjoyed all over the world.  

168
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:50,242
making good espresso is as much a science as it is an art.    

169
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,712
professional machines balance  
temperature and steam pressure  

170
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,383
to produce espresso with kick and crema.       

171
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,985
professional espresso machines  

172
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,588
are made of high-carbon steel sheets.   

173
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,256
computer programmed tools carve different shapes      

174
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,592
out of the steel.        

175
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,192
these parts will be the framework      

176
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,798
for the espresso machine.    

177
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
the tools also cut holes for screws, bolts,        

178
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:21,740
and components like the steam tap.          

179
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,943
an employee places a freshly cut control panel          

180
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,780
into a hydraulic press machine.            

181
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,350
the press bends the panel to the correct shape       

182
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:34,052
and creates tabs for assembly.  

183
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,693
this is the panel before and after bending.    

184
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:46,965
after bending the other panels, they assemble the framework.   

185
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,802
the worker attaches a receptacle to capture excess water.     

186
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,509
he installs meters to control the flow of water.  

187
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:01,146
they release different amounts for long or short espressos.   

188
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:06,318
he turns the base right side   

189
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,856
up and screws the side framework to it.              

190
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:15,327
he attaches the front panel to the sides.          

191
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:21,666
the espresso machine's framework is now in place.         

192
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,935
next, they make the group heads.             

193
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,872
these parts will shoot hot, pressurized water        

194
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,674
through the packed ground coffee.             

195
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,476
the worker installs valves    

196
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,945
that will regulate the water flow.         

197
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,348
the valves allows release built-up pressure            

198
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,686
so that the filter holders can be removed after brewing.  

199
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,691
the group heads fit into slots 
in the front of the framework.  

200
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:51,196
he secures them with nuts at the back.           

201
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,770
he places a large copper-and-brass boiler     

202
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:04,109
in the espresso machine chassis and connects the water lines.  

203
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:08,246
the tank will generate steam  
to froth milk for cappuccinos.  

204
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,382
it will also supply hot water for tea.             

205
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,984
heat exchangers         

206
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,721
run through the boiler to supply the hot water for brewing.    

207
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,923
he connects copper pipes     

208
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,459
to the heat exchanger outlets on the boiler.          

209
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,528
then, he links them to the group heads.       

210
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,330
the pipes have been pre-bent   

211
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:30,736
in order to easily fit into the group heads.      

212
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:35,740
he tightens the fitting for the hot water tap.      

213
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:40,812
next, he installs the pump that pressurizes the water.   

214
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:46,685
he screws it to one side of the framework.        

215
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,686
a worker then wires the electronics         

216
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,689
to the front of the machine.   

217
00:14:56,697 --> 00:15:00,599
the employee fits the control panel to the front framework.  

218
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,239
he slips rubber molding around the protruding seam.   

219
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,776
then, he screws knobs onto the levers.         

220
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:19,184
he tucks a heating coil into  
the upper part of the machine.  

221
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:22,587
the top of the machine works as a cup warmer.      

222
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,792
the espresso stays hot longer when served in heated cups.   

223
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,862
a worker then encases the steel espresso machine         

224
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:35,266
in polycarbonate molded panels.             

225
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,936
the plastic parts are slightly rounded to make   

226
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,072
the espresso machine look less boxy.         

227
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,682
he seats a steel drip tray under the group heads.      

228
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:55,754
and he places the cup tray over the heating element.    

229
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:59,691
the espresso machine is ready  
for the filter basket holders.  

230
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,928
they're equipped with winglets that hook into the group heads.             

231
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,634
the worker tests the espresso machine to confirm        

232
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,838
that there are no leaks in the hydraulic circuitry.   

233
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,476
the machine appears to be in good, working order.     

234
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,582
now, it's time for a coffee break.       

235
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,934
narrator: the best-tasting pizzas     

236
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,937
are made in traditional wood-fired pizza ovens.     

237
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,207
they're constructed primarily of natural clay bricks      

238
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,277
that can withstand high temperatures and retain heat.  

239
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,213
if a chef prefers to not use a wood-burning oven,       

240
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,683
a more convenient gas version is available, as well.      

241
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,423
this italian company has been handcrafting classic pizza ovens              

242
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,559
since 1892.           

243
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:12,096
while the tile or paint options change over time,        

244
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,631
the construction of the oven   

245
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:18,036
itself has remained the same for four generations.      

246
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,774
it begins with the oven's rounded top.           

247
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,241
they lay clay bricks       

248
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,580
on a dome form, working inward from a steel edge.        

249
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,515
these bricks are made in house.             

250
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:34,786
they can withstand temperatures of over 900 degrees fahrenheit.           

251
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,255
that's fast enough to bake   
a traditional neapolitan pizza  

252
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,257
in just 60 seconds.       

253
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,592
they combine sand,        

254
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,596
soil, concrete, clay and water in a mixer.      

255
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,931
they pour this mixture      

256
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,535
into a steel mold for the base of the oven.    

257
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,937
once they fill the mold to the top,           

258
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:57,609
they place a circular template in the exact center of the mold.              

259
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,146
then, they begin constructing  
the oven's combustion chamber.  

260
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,948
this is where the pizza is baked.            

261
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,683
the carefully place clay bricks             

262
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,821
along the template's inner perimeter.         

263
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:13,091
then, they remove the template and add more bricks.       

264
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,628
they work from the outside in, towards the center.       

265
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,436
the oven floor         
serves as the cooking surface.  

266
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,638
it's comprised of four pie-shape pieces     

267
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,375
made of the same heat-resistant clay as the bricks.       

268
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,312
each piece is 2 inches thick.  

269
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,648
they slide the floor in temporarily          

270
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,885
so they can correctly      
position the bricks around it.  

271
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,259
they remove the floor pieces and begin mortaring the bricks.             

272
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:52,631
once complete, this oven will weigh over 5,000 pounds.  

273
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,401
the company makes even larger models     

274
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,570
that can weigh more than 3 tons.              

275
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,812
they lay a second row of bricks on top of the first.       

276
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,749
then, they fill the middle with clay.            

277
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:15,687
the team covers the clay with soil.            

278
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,022
they pack down the soil     

279
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:21,559
as they go to create a hard, stable surface.         

280
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,065
now, they can permanently install the oven floor.     

281
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,307
next, they position the oven's cast iron mouth.   

282
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,576
they lay bricks in a circle around the mouth         

283
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,579
to form the wall of the combustion chamber.    

284
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,981
they lay most of the bricks   

285
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:47,252
vertically to fit in as many as possible.       

286
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:53,057
more bricks will provide better insulation in the chamber.    

287
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,861
the team pours water on the top edge of the wall.   

288
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,132
they remove the oven mouth and apply the mortar.      

289
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,201
then, they lower the dome onto the wall          

290
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,270
to enclose the combustion chamber.     

291
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:12,010
a worker repositions the mouth and mortars it in place.     

292
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,345
he installs the over mouth,   

293
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:19,083
a cast iron plate bearing the manufacturer's name.              

294
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,954
he levels it, then fills the gap between the mouth and oven floor              

295
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,891
with plaster.          

296
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,694
they also use plaster to create a smooth surface    

297
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,496
on top of the mouth.       

298
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,764
now, the smoke will rise through the hood         

299
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:37,435
toward the chimney instead of being trapped in the oven.    

300
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:43,108
they position steel side plates and weld them to the over mouth.             

301
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,011
then, they wield        
on a curved steel front plate.  

302
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,714
next, they construct       

303
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,652
a funnel-shaped stainless steel hood.      

304
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,387
they fill the hood with the same mixture      

305
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,923
they used for the oven's base.  

306
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:04,329
they cover the dome with wire mesh to compact the mix.     

307
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:07,465
then, they apply a final coat of the mixture.         

308
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:15,473
a worker lays a cast iron plate on the base,           

309
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:20,011
directly in front of the mouth.             

310
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,746
he spreads a smooth finishing layer of concrete        

311
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,617
on both the dome and the base.  

312
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,952
then, they paint the steel    

313
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,222
and cast iron parts with anti-corrosion paint.    

314
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,558
they install marble on the base              

315
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,561
and apply paint or tile to the dome.           

316
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,697
they mount the oven steel door last.              

317
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,300
they fire up the oven for 9 days to dry all the natural      

318
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,768
construction materials.     

319
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,805
then, this oven is complete.
