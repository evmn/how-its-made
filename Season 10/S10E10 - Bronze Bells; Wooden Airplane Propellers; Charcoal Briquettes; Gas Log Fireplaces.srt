00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,823
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,325
         bronze bells...        

3
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,032
...wooden airplane propellers...

4
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,171
    ...charcoal briquettes...   

5
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,145
   ...and gas-log fireplaces.   

6
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,653
       throughout history,      

7
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,323
bells have played both practical
      and ceremonial roles.     

8
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,526
    village bells would ring    
          to mark time          

9
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,193
     and to warn of danger.     

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,063
     church bells would toll    
      to summon worshipers.     

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,733
  bells are traditionally cast  
           of bronze,           

12
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,836
    a metal that's as durable   
        as it is melodic.       

13
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,408
        [ bells tolling ]       

14
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,143
  when it comes to bell making, 

15
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,146
    there'd be neither swing    
    nor ring without a mold.    

16
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:25,617
     and only a quality mold    
      makes a quality bell.     

17
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,686
        the mold is made        
        using a pattern.        

18
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,490
 this particular bell will have 
decorative lines on the surface,

19
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,492
       which will require       
         a separate mold        

20
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,295
         made from this         
       five-piece pattern.      

21
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:39,164
  after greasing the pattern's  
  surface with a release agent, 

22
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,300
  workers lower a wooden casing 
           around it.           

23
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,235
           this casing          
      will hold the mixture     

24
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:47,038
  of fine silica sand and epoxy 
  they'll use to make the mold. 

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,374
    workers pack the material   
             tightly            

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,644
 between the pattern and casing.

27
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,780
  the epoxy sets in 10 minutes, 

28
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,915
  and now they have a sand mold 

29
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,384
        in which to cast        
     the bell's decorations.    

30
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,721
     they still need a mold     
    to cast the bell itself.    

31
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,190
          they make it          
   with this aluminum pattern.  

32
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,460
after spraying it inside and out
      with a release agent,     

33
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,998
 they lower the decoration mold 
 they just made right over it...

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,236
  then on top of that, a steel  
 casing to contain the sand mix.

35
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,081
    workers pack the sand mix   
     and wait for it to set.    

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,621
    then they flip the casing   
     and add another section    

37
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,424
   to hold even more sand mix.  

38
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,359
    but before the next load    
            of sand,            

39
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,428
    they insert what's called   
            the gate.           

40
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,430
       this aluminum rod        
       shapes the channel       

41
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,832
   through which they'll pour   
        the molten bronze       

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,169
      into the mold cavity.     

43
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,674
      they fill up the mold     
         with more sand.        

44
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,112
     then they form a funnel    
   around the central channel   

45
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,247
             because            
    it's virtually impossible   

46
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,717
 to pour molten bronze directly 
     into such a small hole.    

47
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,921
     they poke the sand mix     
     to make sure it's set,     

48
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,458
     then pull out the gate.    

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,594
 they separate the two casings, 

50
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,463
     each of which contains     
     a section of the mold.     

51
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:23,534
   then the patterns come out,  
 leaving behind the mold cavity.

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,271
 workers tidy up the mold walls 

53
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,107
          and paint on          
  a powdered graphite solution  

54
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,608
  which will act as a barrier,  

55
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,345
    preventing the hot metal    
     from eroding the epoxy     

56
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,813
    that holds the sand mold    
            together.           

57
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,351
       next, they spray on      
     a second coat of wash.     

58
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,886
       the sand is so fine      
     that without this step,    

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,423
    the mold would reproduce    
        the brush strokes       

60
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,890
       onto the cast bell.      

61
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,693
    now they measure the size   
        of the pour hole        

62
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,896
and custom-make a ceramic filter
         to glue inside.        

63
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,499
   this filter will screen out  
            the slag,           

64
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,970
  oxidized particles that form  
  when molten metal meets air.  

65
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,040
   workers stack the two mold   
     sections back together     

66
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,110
 and clamp them tightly so that 
    the bronze won't leak out   

67
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,145
         during casting.

    for an average-size bell    

69
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,185
     takes about two hours.     

70
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,722
     to get a smooth enough     
          consistency,          

71
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:21,260
   the furnace has to heat the  
  metal to about 2,100 degrees. 

72
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,596
     for a quality casting,     

73
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,000
    they must pour the bronze   
    in one continuous flow --   

74
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,002
      no stops and starts.      

75
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,540
the funneling basin they made in
 the sand prevents overflowing. 

76
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,543
     the bronze takes about     
     a half-hour to solidify    

77
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,813
   and up to 24 hours to cool.  

78
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,748
  workers remove the sand mold  
       with a jackhammer,       

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,219
  being very careful not to hit 
        the bell inside.        

80
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:51,556
  the extracted bell is covered 
  in a residue of burnt epoxy,  

81
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,559
       which they remove        
       with a wire brush.       

82
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,163
then, with one well-aimed strike
       of a sledgehammer,       

83
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,066
    they disengage the gate.    

84
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,371
     now they mark the exact    
    center point of the bell.   

85
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,907
  that's where they'll install  
          the hardware          

86
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,842
 from which the bell will hang. 

87
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,511
    they drill a small hole,    

88
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,313
 then gradually drill it larger 
           and larger.          

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,983
    a big hole can't be bored   
           in one shot          

90
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,119
  because the friction-induced  
   heat would crack the bell.   

91
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,255
workers tip the bell on its side
     to hang the clapper --     

92
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,926
        the official name       
  for the bronze hammer inside. 

93
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,262
every bell this factory produces

94
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,732
     goes through six stages    
          of polishing,         

95
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,400
          starting with         
     a coarse grinding belt     

96
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,737
       and finishing with       
   a fine-cloth buffing wheel.  

97
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,939
  two hours of polishing later, 

98
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,541
   the bell looks as beautiful  
          as it sounds.

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,754
     coming up...a new spin     
 on a centuries-old invention --

101
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,556
      the wooden propeller.     

102
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,093
     narrator: the propeller    
       dates back to 1493,      

103
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,829
     when leonardo da vinci     
          sketched out          

104
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,564
 the concept for a helical screw

105
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,499
   that could propel a machine  
    vertically into the sky.    

106
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,902
     the propeller is still     
    occasionally referred to    

107
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,437
        as an airscrew --       

108
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,907
 a term that accurately reflects
 its basic design and function. 

109
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,010
    the key to making one --    
       plenty of sanding.       

110
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,921
 wooden propellers start out as 
a laminated block of maple wood.

111
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,528
     lamination is a process    

112
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,364
      where several layers      
      are glued together.       

113
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,402
            the block           
  has between 36 and 48 layers  

114
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,439
less than 1/16 of an inch thick.

115
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:55,413
     depending on the model,    
 workers select a master pattern

116
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,150
       that is between one      
       and two yards long.      

117
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,488
      they lay this pattern     
      over the maple block      

118
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,524
and mark a one-inch center hole.

119
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,569
     they drill the hole...     

120
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,573
   and lay in a centering pin   
  to hold the pattern in place. 

121
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,746
   a worker traces the pattern  
    on the top of the block.    

122
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,188
    he then cuts the outline    
        with a band saw.        

123
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,758
this is the propeller's profile.

124
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,732
    next, he traces a pattern   
    on the side of the block.   

125
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,667
this is the propeller's pitch --

126
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,670
       the amount of twist      
         in the blades,         

127
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,340
    which dictates the amount   
      of propeller thrust.      

128
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,408
     using a pattern guide,     

129
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,278
    he marks where the pitch    
   blends into the center hub,  

130
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,448
      then removes the bulk     
  of the pitch with a band saw. 

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,229
 now he clamps the block onto a 
 computer-guided milling machine

132
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,399
      that carves the pitch     
   to very precise dimensions.  

133
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,111
          the machine's         
     carbide-tipped cutters     

134
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:37,115
   shave infinitesimal amounts  
     of wood with each pass.    

135
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,392
        precision milling       
  just one end of the propeller 

136
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,828
    can take up to 60 passes.   

137
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,044
      next, a worker shapes     
  the airfoil with a band saw.  

138
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,082
     the airfoil is the side    
        of the propeller        

139
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,951
         that is shaped         
      like an airplane wing     

140
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,120
  and produces forward thrust.  

141
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,028
        the pitch side...       

142
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,030
      and the airfoil side.     

143
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,700
       workers use a tool       
       called a spokeshave      

144
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,236
     to smooth the propeller    
           even more.           

145
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,440
 then they verify the airfoil's 
       thickness and curve      

146
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,409
       with a hand gauge.       

147
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,716
a spray of dark paint helps them
     know where they've been    

148
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,252
    as they begin smoothing     
    the propeller's surface.    

149
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,187
    they remove any remaining   
          carving marks         

150
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,357
      using a belt sander.      

151
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,366
  then they check the propeller 
          for balance.          

152
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,606
 using a pneumatic sanding drum,

153
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,809
 they perform an overall sanding

154
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,012
     and punch in propeller     
        specifications --       

155
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,082
        diameter, pitch,        
    flight direction symbols,   

156
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,950
      and manufacturer i.d.     

157
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,286
      workers hand-inspect      
         the propeller,         

158
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,823
  then perform a final sanding  
          and balance.          

159
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,132
     a coat of clear enamel     
         seals the wood.        

160
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,372
       and a safety color       
       sprayed on the tips      

161
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:45,443
   makes the propeller visible  
      while it's spinning.      

162
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,246
   two final protective coats   
        of clear enamel,        

163
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,381
    24 hours of drying time,    

164
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,652
      and these propellers      
     are ready for takeoff.     

165
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,192
         when we return,        
       fire up the grill.       

166
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,495
        it's time to make       
    some charcoal briquettes.   

167
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,067
narrator: the charcoal briquette
      was invented in 1897,     

168
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,870
     but interest in it was     
   slow-burning, so to speak,   

169
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,738
        until the 1920s.        

170
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,606
that's when automaker henry ford

171
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,342
 decided to recycle wood scraps 
         from car making        

172
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,211
    into barbecue briquettes,   

173
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,848
    and these little nuggets    
   became a smoking sensation.  

174
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,221
    barbecuing with charcoal    

175
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,890
  has become immensely popular  
       since ford's time,       

176
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,160
     and every year, several    
   million tons of wood scraps  

177
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,430
 are converted into high-quality
      charcoal briquettes.      

178
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,132
   today, briquette production  

179
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,637
     starts with sawdust and    
  wood chips from lumber mills. 

180
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,606
     a truck unloads it all     
           into a pit.          

181
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,845
  bulldozers blend the material 
           called fuel          

182
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,414
to obtain a uniform end product.

183
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,193
      as the mix travels up     
           a conveyer,          

184
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:13,765
    an electromagnet removes    
    any metal contaminates.     

185
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,072
       the mix falls onto       
      a vibratory screener,     

186
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,008
         which sifts out        
   the larger pieces of wood.   

187
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,615
         at this point,         
  the fuel is still very moist. 

188
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,084
           to dry it,           
   a worm screw draws the mix   

189
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,487
 up into a long, rotating dryer.

190
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:43,694
  the dryer heats the wood mix  
  to a searing 1,400 degrees.   

191
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,332
 the dryer is sealed to prevent 
     oxygen from leaking in.    

192
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,169
      this allows the wood      
  to dry without catching fire. 

193
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,508
after four minutes in the dryer,

194
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,545
the moisture has been cooked out
           of the mix.          

195
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,382
   workers add anthracite coal  
         to the hopper,         

196
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,719
 and it mixes in with the fuel. 

197
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,722
    anthracite coal is known    
for burning at high temperature.

198
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,264
     then they mix in lime.     

199
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,333
 lime makes the briquettes turn 
 white after they're ignited -- 

200
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,535
       a visual indication      
        that the barbecue       

201
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,136
   is ready to rock 'n' roll.   

202
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:31,609
 the mix, now blackened, passes 
  under a second electromagnet  

203
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,012
 to remove any metal that could 
damage the equipment downstream.

204
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,415
    finally, workers blend in   
           cornstarch,          

205
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,386
           which binds          
    the ingredients together.   

206
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,762
      a worm screw supplies     
  the mixture to a press roll,  

207
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:55,300
where a constant spray of water 
keeps the mixture from sticking.

208
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,714
     the press rolls compact    
  the mixture into briquettes.  

209
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,817
        the process takes       
  just a fraction of a second.  

210
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,728
  at this point, the briquettes 
      contain 35% moisture      

211
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,631
       and are very soft.       

212
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,473
   a screener shakes out fine   
  material from the briquettes, 

213
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,343
        which is recycled       
     back into the process.     

214
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,150
     a sweep belt transports    
 and distributes the briquettes 

215
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,587
  in a 250-foot drying tunnel.  

216
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,357
 they are heated to 280 degrees 
        for 2 1/2 hours.        

217
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,296
 this will reduce their moisture
   level from 35% to just 5%.   

218
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,733
  the lower the moisture level, 
      the better it burns.      

219
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,904
    a conveyer transports the   
 briquettes to automated scales 

220
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,440
 that weigh them for packaging. 

221
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:14,245
   every portion is the same,   
  plus or minus one briquette.  

222
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,381
          as the scales         
     release the briquettes,    

223
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:21,052
     robots below move bags     
 into position to capture them. 

224
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,332
        a sealing machine       
      glue-seals the bags,      

225
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,969
  then prints a production date 
  and shipped code on each one. 

226
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,812
          open the bag,         
     and a backyard barbecue    

227
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,682
 is just one match stroke away. 

228
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:55,386
  and who can resist the smokey 
flavor of charcoal-grilled food?

229
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,698
   when we return...turning up  
    a different kind of flame   

230
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,467
    with gas-log fireplaces.    

231
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,904
  narrator: gas-log fireplaces  
       are clean-burning,       

232
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,641
      fully contained units     
 that are growing in popularity.

233
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,445
   they provide instant warmth  
    at the flick of a switch.   

234
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,848
  and you'll never have to head 
   out on a cold winter night   

235
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,285
        to get more logs        
     or clean up the ashes.     

236
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,264
  to make a gas-log fireplace,  

237
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:46,003
  workers first screw fittings  
     to a gas-control valve.    

238
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,141
   then they attach the valve   
   and gas pilot to the frame.  

239
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,211
 the gas pilot is a small flame 
    that burns continuously,    

240
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,381
 enabling you to ignite the gas 
           instantly.           

241
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,952
   they cap the control valve   
      with knob extensions      

242
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,021
 that allow the user to control 
      the flame's intensity     

243
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,625
   from outside the fireplace.  

244
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,828
   next, they install burners   
          and orifices.         

245
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,698
  the orifice controls the gas  
  flow in each of the burners.  

246
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,570
    they attach an electrical   
  connection from the gas pilot 

247
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:23,107
     to the control valve...    

248
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:28,112
      adjust the length of      
  the gas-pilot supply line...  

249
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,282
       and screw the line       
      to the control valve.     

250
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,988
  finally, the line is attached 
        to the gas pilot.       

251
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,191
 the fireplace's ignition system
        is now complete.        

252
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:44,195
  next, workers attach a safety 
  device called a thermocouple  

253
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,663
      to the control valve.     

254
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,532
   if the flame ever goes out,  

255
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,601
        the thermocouple        
      cuts the gas supply.      

256
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,670
 the unit now undergoes testing 

257
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,672
    to ensure that there are    
            no leaks.           

258
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,679
what's a fireplace without logs,

259
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,316
    even if they're replicas    
       of the real thing?       

260
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,351
          this factory          
      makes artificial logs     

261
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,087
         from a mixture         
of fire-resistant ceramic fibers

262
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,091
       and a liquid resin       
 that binds the fibers together.

263
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:27,972
  workers attach a log-forming  
    mold to a pumping arm...    

264
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,174
      then immerse the arm      
         in the mixture.        

265
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,348
           the mixture          
     fills the mold cavity.     

266
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,654
       the mixture is soft      
  when it comes out of the mold 

267
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,988
      and is held together      

268
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,992
 by the dense, interwoven layers
           of fibers.           

269
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,227
the excess fiber is trimmed off,

270
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,264
      and the log is placed     
        on a baking rack.       

271
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:01,839
     then it's into an oven     
   at 450 degrees for 5 hours.  

272
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,682
       when it comes out,       
     it's as hard as a log.     

273
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,619
 workers remove the sharp edges 
          with a rasp,          

274
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,857
then dip the log in a mixture of
binder and heat-resistant paint.

275
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,834
           over that,           
     they hand-paint details    

276
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,370
      replicating the look      
        of charred wood.        

277
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,982
  the paint is baked on, making 
   this decoration permanent.   

278
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,652
    and it'll have no problem   
        taking the heat.        

279
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,854
            the paint           
   can withstand temperatures   

280
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,590
      up to 2,300 degrees.      

281
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,006
 back in the testing department,
 workers calibrate the mechanism

282
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,309
          that adjusts          
      the fireplace flame.      

283
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:20,150
 they use a flowmeter to verify 
the rate at which the gas flows.

284
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,086
    the back burner produces    
         a yellow flame,        

285
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,957
     while the front burner     
    gives off a reddish glow.   

286
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,494
            combined,           
    they look more realistic.   

287
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,963
         workers package        
    the individual components   

288
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,832
   and include some lava rock   

289
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,301
   to simulate a bed of ashes   
      underneath the logs.      

290
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,582
 it all adds up to a beautiful, 
          cozy fire...          

291
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,251
    at the flick of a switch.
