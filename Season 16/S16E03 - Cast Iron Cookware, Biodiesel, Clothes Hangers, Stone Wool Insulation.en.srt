00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,586
            narrator:           
 cast-iron cookware is renowned 

4
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,054
    for its superior ability    

5
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,256
         to retain heat         
     and diffuse it evenly.     

6
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,858
    bare cast iron, however,    

7
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,594
     requires regular oiling    
       to ward off rust --      

8
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,596
 not so with enameled cast iron.

9
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:06,332
     a glass-enamel coating     
        encases the iron,       

10
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:10,069
  making the cookware entirely  
   maintenance-free, forever.   

11
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,339
 since 1925, this french company

12
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,009
       has been producing       
  enameled cast-iron cookware.  

13
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,078
    its high-end products are   
 renowned for their thin walls, 

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,816
     which makes it the most    
     lightweight cast-iron      
     cookware available.        

15
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:28,154
the secret -- the mineral levels
       in the iron recipe.      

16
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,689
         at the foundry,        
    they begin with pig iron,   

17
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,491
 which has high carbon content. 

18
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,494
         then they melt         
 in a calculated amount of steel

19
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,397
        to further boost        
        the carbon level.       

20
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:48,107
   the melting oven heats the   
metals to 1,520 degrees celsius,

21
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,176
         liquefying them        
       in just 45 minutes.      

22
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,179
 workers add a powdered chemical

23
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,715
   to agglomerate the natural   
     impurities in the iron,    

24
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,717
           then scoop           
  those bonded impurities out.  

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,254
    meanwhile, workers mount    
    a two-part mold template    

26
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,057
  onto a machine which produces 
         the sand molds         

27
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,026
     with which they'll cast    
          the cookware.         

28
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:10,596
the machine injects the sand mix
       into the templates.      

29
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,200
  the mix contains clay, water, 
   and proprietary ingredients  

30
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,469
           which makes          
     the sand compact well.     

31
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,471
     compaction is critical     

32
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,341
  because just one single grain 
of sand displacing from the mold

33
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,877
      would produce a flaw      
        on the cookware.        

34
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,882
         it's essential         
  that the pouring temperature  

35
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,351
   be precise and consistent,   

36
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,620
    so they transfer the iron   
      from the melting oven     

37
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,022
  to a temperature-maintenance  
              oven.             

38
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,492
           from there,          
   they pour the molten metal   

39
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:43,863
through a mere 1/10th-of-an-inch
  gap between the mold halves.  

40
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,701
           the process          
      is entirely automated     

41
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:52,505
    because the pouring angle   
     and speed are critical.    

42
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:56,575
      the molten iron cools     
  and solidifies in 20 minutes. 

43
00:02:56,577 --> 00:03:00,312
       then the molds drop      
 onto a vibrating mesh conveyor.

44
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,182
      the shaking releases      
the cast cookware from the mold,

45
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,184
    along with the metal that   
 solidified in the flow channels

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,320
   leading to the mold cavity.  

47
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,392
       the cookware moves       
      into a closed chamber     

48
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,729
where a high-pressure gun blasts
  the surface with steel balls  

49
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:19,931
 to remove all remaining grains 
            of sand.            

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,669
   at this stage, the cookware  
     has rough excess metal     

51
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,004
       where the two parts      
        of the mold met.        

52
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,206
         so now workers         
     smooth away these burrs    

53
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,409
     using a grinding wheel     
        on the outside...       

54
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,648
      ...and a grinding pin     
       in the tight spots.      

55
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:42,354
    the cookware is now ready   
  to be prepped for enameling.  

56
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:45,424
 a machine now blasts the entire
     piece with steel grits,    

57
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,692
   making the surface texture   
             uniform            

58
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,529
          so the enamel         
       will adhere evenly.      

59
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,504
    the first coat of enamel    

60
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,505
     is strictly to protect     
          the cast iron         

61
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,708
  and prevent it from rusting.  

62
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,643
   enamel is a form of glass.   

63
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:08,114
     however, this enamel is    
    engineered to be flexible   

64
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:12,251
     because metal cookware     
  naturally expands as it heats 

65
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,386
   and contracts as it cools.   

66
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,921
  after a trip through a dryer, 

67
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,923
  the enamel goes into an oven  

68
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,192
             at more            
  than 1,500 degrees fahrenheit 

69
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,861
      for about 45 minutes.     

70
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,529
       during this firing,      

71
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,665
  the hair-thin enamel coating  
      becomes translucent.      

72
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,467
    the second coat of enamel   

73
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,602
        completely seals        
       the porous surface.      

74
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,005
it's made of some 20 components,

75
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:37,276
     including enamel chips,    
     pieces of clear glass,     

76
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,645
 and pigment powders for color. 

77
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,818
    an automated spray system   
     coats the inside first.    

78
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,756
      workers wipe the edge     

79
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,425
      to prevent the piece      
 from sticking to the conveyor, 

80
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,626
         then the handle        

81
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,563
   because they'll paint that   
       a different color.       

82
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,031
 they spray the handle manually,

83
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,567
 then the automated system coats
            the rest.           

84
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,705
 the iron recipe contains a high
 level of the mineral silicate, 

85
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,707
     which helps the enamel     
          adhere well.          

86
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,547
    once again, the cookware    
    goes through the dryer,     

87
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,184
   then into the oven at more   
  than 1,500 degrees fahrenheit 

88
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,521
      for about 45 minutes      
     to vitrify the enamel.     

89
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,122
    once the cookware cools,    

90
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,925
          it undergoes          
   a final visual inspection,   

91
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,528
         the last of 30         
     quality-control checks     

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,131
           throughout           
     the production process.    

93
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,967
   enameled cast-iron cookware  
      lasts for generations     

94
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,003
     because it doesn't warp    
            over time           

95
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,040
 and remains food-safe for life.

96
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,689
     narrator: biodiesel is     
 a more eco-friendly diesel fuel

97
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,559
 that's made from vegetable oil 
         or animal fat.         

98
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,028
      unlike regular diesel     
          and gasoline,         

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,298
       producing biodiesel      
   doesn't require petroleum.   

100
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,635
   instead, the raw materials   
      are locally available     

101
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,937
 and can be recycled from waste.

102
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:19,311
if your car has a diesel engine,
  it can run on biodiesel fuel, 

103
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,180
    usually without requiring   
       any modifications.       

104
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,449
         while biodiesel        
      and petroleum diesel      

105
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,519
are similar in energy efficiency
        and fuel economy,       

106
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,122
 biodiesel is more eco-friendly.

107
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,524
  for starters, it can be made  

108
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,326
    from what would otherwise   
       have been waste --       

109
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,661
 for example, from vegetable oil

110
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:41,000
        from the kitchen        
 of your local fast-food joint. 

111
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:44,003
 the restaurant simply discards 
       its used fryer oil       

112
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,338
    in a receptacle out back.   

113
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,412
 every few days, a vacuum truck 
     comes by to collect it.    

114
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,613
      in its current state,     

115
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,082
     the oil contains water     
       and food particles,      

116
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,818
       making it unusable       
    for biodiesel production,   

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,756
   so the truck transports it   
      to a filtering plant.     

118
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:07,493
    there, they pump the oil    
      into a holding tank,      

119
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:10,462
         then heat it up        
     to draw out the water.     

120
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,900
   once they drain the water,   

121
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:18,304
    the oil is ready to enter   
a multi-stage filtering process.

122
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,243
       first, the oil goes      
    through a vibrating sieve   

123
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:27,980
        which strains out       
  the larger pieces of debris.  

124
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,582
   after this first filtering,  

125
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,918
           the oil is           
    already visibly cleaner.    

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,922
     next, it passes through    
    a second vibrating sieve.   

127
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,857
   this one has a finer mesh.   

128
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,860
      therefore, it catches     
  smaller particles of debris.  

129
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,063
    after this second stage,    

130
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:48,867
  the oil looks clean but still 
  contains microscopic debris,  

131
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:53,071
     so it enters the third     
  and final filtering stage --  

132
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,941
         passing through        
   20 ultra-fine filter cloths  

133
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:59,478
     which trap any particle    
 larger than one micron in size.

134
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,747
           a micron is          
     about 80 times smaller     

135
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,882
         than the width         
        of a human hair.        

136
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:09,288
   the captured debris leaves   
 a muddy residue on the filters.

137
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,558
       that vegetable oil,      
 which once deep-fried potatoes,

138
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,894
     is now ready to cook up    
        some diesel fuel.       

139
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,432
      another source of oil     
      for making biodiesel      

140
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,701
        is beef tallow --       
    oil derived from cow fat.   

141
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,438
      biodiesel producers       
      typically buy tallow      

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,575
 from facilities like this one, 
        which specialize        

143
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,511
     in cleaning cow hides      
     for leather tanneries.     

144
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,980
     sharp, revolving blades    

145
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,518
        shear off the fat       
   from the back of the hide.   

146
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,986
 the fat drops onto a conveyor, 

147
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,057
       which moves it into      
  a steam-injection cook tank.  

148
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,126
     the tank heats the fat     
        to a gentle boil,       

149
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,661
       extracting the oil.      

150
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,463
 everything else leaves the tank

151
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,800
            and drops           
     into a waste container.    

152
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,536
      the oil moves onward,     

153
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,739
         passing through        
 a two-stage filtration process.

154
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:12,484
   whether the raw material is  
  vegetable oil or beef tallow, 

155
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,352
     the biodiesel producers    

156
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,022
  refer to this main ingredient 
          as feedstock.         

157
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,092
   when the feedstock arrives   
     at the biodiesel plant,    

158
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:24,296
   it goes into a holding tank  
     until production time.     

159
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:29,301
 this demonstration illustrates 
     the production recipe.     

160
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,170
     they take the feedstock    

161
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:35,174
  and combine it with methanol, 
     a type of wood alcohol,    

162
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,841
   as well as with a catalyst,  

163
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,244
         which triggers         
      a chemical reaction.      

164
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,847
        a processing unit       
   mixes everything thoroughly  

165
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,048
         while applying         
       heat and pressure.       

166
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,452
 the resulting chemical reaction
 produces a harmless byproduct, 

167
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,790
  glycerin, a common ingredient 
     in soaps and cosmetics.    

168
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,993
       processing consumes      
      much of the methanol.     

169
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,128
   then they remove even more,  

170
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,197
          leaving just          
     a tiny percentage of it    

171
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,865
   in the finished biodiesel.   

172
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,468
   to ensure their fuel meets   

173
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,870
          international         
      regulatory standards,     

174
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,539
           the plant's          
   quality-control lab samples  

175
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,842
    from each production run.   

176
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,545
   in this flammability test,   

177
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,948
       they heat the fuel       
   to 275 degrees fahrenheit,   

178
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,018
    then apply a flame to see   
    whether the gases ignite.   

179
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,021
      if they do, they have     
     to remove more methanol    

180
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,690
     to make the fuel safe.     

181
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,091
      if they don't ignite,     

182
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,627
         the fuel meets         
 international safety standards.

183
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,498
      biodiesel costs more      
          at the pump,          

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,636
  but emits significantly less  
  carbon dioxide and monoxide   

185
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,905
          and 85% fewer         
      cancer-causing agents     

186
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,142
    into the air we breathe.    

187
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,257
            narrator:           
      until the mid-1800s,      

188
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,859
          people folded         
   or laid their clothes flat   

189
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,729
 or hung them on hooks or pegs. 

190
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,065
   once it became more common   
 to store clothes in a wardrobe,

191
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,202
      someone -- historians     
    don't know exactly who --   

192
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,870
  invented the clothes hanger,  

193
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,140
        a hanging device        
  shaped like human shoulders.  

194
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,077
   since the mid 19th century,  

195
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,680
   hundreds of inventors have   
patented various shaped hangers,

196
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,284
        many of which are       
   still being produced today.  

197
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,754
 this czech company makes wooden
   hangers in several styles.   

198
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,758
         it uses beech,         
a hard and durable type of wood.

199
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,229
 the damp logs air-dry outdoors 
        for seven months,       

200
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,897
       then go into a kiln      
    for three to four weeks.    

201
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,500
  drying the wood is critical.  

202
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:42,967
     otherwise, the hangers     

203
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,104
    would expand and contract   
    with temperature changes    

204
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,773
      and eventually crack.     

205
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,307
  workers first use a band saw  

206
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,510
        to slice the logs       
  into 2 1/2-inch-thick planks. 

207
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,781
    then they put each plank    
  through a broaching machine.  

208
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,984
     inside, a toothed blade    
        planes the wood,        

209
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:02,921
  rendering the top and bottom  
   surfaces level and smooth.   

210
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:09,127
 next stop is a grinding machine
 which contains abrasive belts. 

211
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:22,040
     workers feed the planks    
 into the machine one at a time.

212
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,145
  as each plank passes through, 

213
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,616
       the belts above it       
   sand the tops silky smooth.  

214
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,884
         when the plank         
       exits the machine,       

215
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:37,289
   workers flip and refeed it   
   to smooth the other side.    

216
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,093
      an automated saw cuts     
      each plank in half...     

217
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,966
    ...and trims the halves     
    to a specific dimension.    

218
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,171
    the now-smaller planks go   
  into another grinding machine 

219
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,807
  which sands the sides smooth. 

220
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,447
 now the hanger shaping begins. 

221
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,649
     workers stack 10 planks    

222
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:08,120
   and, using a circular saw,   
  cut them to the same length,  

223
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,222
 the ends at a 60-degree angle. 

224
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,862
they mount four planks at a time
      on a milling machine      

225
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,798
   and cut a tongue-and-groove  
      profile on the edges.     

226
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,135
      they'll later connect     
        the hanger parts        

227
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,671
     by fitting the tongues     
        into the grooves.       

228
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,341
    stacking six planks now,    

229
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,145
   they trace a hanger-shaped   
  template on the top surface,  

230
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,981
      then carefully follow     
  the trace line with a jigsaw. 

231
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,421
each plank is now roughly shaped
      into a half a hanger,     

232
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,823
   which they call a lamella.   

233
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,562
     this particular hanger     
    is designed for dresses,    

234
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,565
      so they mill a groove     
 in the shoulder of each lamella

235
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,167
       for garment straps.      

236
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,636
        then an automated       
         milling machine        

237
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,239
      refines and finalizes     
       the hanger's shape,      

238
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,943
 smoothing the roughly cut wood 
         in the process.        

239
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,448
        next, with strong       
      cabinetmaker's glue,      

240
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,650
      they coat the tongues     
  and grooves of two lamellas,  

241
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,519
     then fit them together     
           on a press.          

242
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,788
      they let the glue dry     
           for a day,           

243
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,190
 then saw the point off the top.

244
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,193
    this creates a flat area    

245
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,662
      into which to insert      
       the hanger's hook.       

246
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,530
     there's already a hole     
          for it there,         

247
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,066
      made when they milled     
 the tongue-and-groove profile. 

248
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,872
    next, they sand the joint   
      to remove excess glue     

249
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,276
    and smooth out any nicks    
      or tears in the wood.     

250
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,345
         then they round        
       the angular joint.       

251
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,284
  to seal and protect the wood, 

252
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,886
         they now spray         
the entire surface with varnish.

253
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,756
         when it dries,         
    they do a rough sanding,    

254
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,894
    then apply a second coat    
        and let that dry.       

255
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,762
 many customers want their logo 

256
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,965
     printed on the hangers     
           they order.          

257
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,299
      the printing machine      

258
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,635
coats a logo-embossed rubber pad
            with ink.           

259
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,238
     a sponge dabs the pad,     

260
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,573
      then stamps the logo      
        onto the hanger.        

261
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,181
            finally,            
    the hanger's iron hook --   

262
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,650
    it's either nickel-plated   
        for a silver tone       

263
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,119
        or brass-plated         
        for a gold tone.        

264
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,720
   workers position the hook.   

265
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,923
      then a press rams it      
          into the wood         

266
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,591
      4/10 of an inch deep.     

267
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,394
 the hook has screwlike threads 
           at the base          

268
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:34,166
       which grab and lock      
   into the surrounding wood.   

269
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,067
       for certain models,      

270
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,470
  the factory stains or paints  
the wood prior to varnishing it.

271
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,274
     after all, many people     
   like their clothes hangers   

272
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,843
             to make            
    a fashion statement, too.   

273
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,892
            narrator:           
       an erupting volcano      

274
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,495
      led to the invention      
    of stone wool insulation    

275
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,297
    a century and a half ago.   

276
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,699
         it was observed        
       that volcanic lava       

277
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,236
  could be whipped into woolly  
   tufts by prevailing winds.   

278
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,372
 soon, this was being replicated
          in factories          

279
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,975
      to produce stone wool     
         for insulation.        

280
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,713
       shaped into batts,       

281
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,316
      stone wool insulation     
      can be tucked snugly      

282
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,585
        between the studs       
        of a framed wall.       

283
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:32,390
    it acts as both a thermal   
     and acoustic insulator.    

284
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,860
           and here's           
    the soundproofing proof.    

285
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,394
     in this demonstration,     

286
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:40,598
  an activated alarm goes into  
  a box lined with stone wool.  

287
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,935
     when the lid is closed,    
     the sound is contained.    

288
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:47,606
   and when it's lifted again,  
   the annoying sound is back.  

289
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,747
      they make stone wool      
    from basalt rock and slag   

290
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,082
            recycled            
    from the steel industry.    

291
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,686
 the process is fueled by coke, 
    which is a form of coal.    

292
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,291
           basalt rock          
    is solidified lava formed   

293
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,761
   when rock melts underground  
     and then quickly cools.    

294
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,698
     after the rock has been    
partially crushed at the quarry,

295
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
a loader scoops it onto a screen

296
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,170
  to separate the bigger pieces 
    from the fine particles.    

297
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,773
 the particles will be processed
        into briquettes,        

298
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,909
        which can be used       
in the production of stone wool,

299
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,512
  along with the bigger pieces  
            of rock.            

300
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,648
    the rock and briquettes,    
   along with the steel slag,   

301
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,118
  melt into lava in a furnace.  

302
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,054
       temperatures reach       
   2,700 degrees fahrenheit --  

303
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,789
      as hot as a volcano.      

304
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,058
       a spinning machine       
         whips the lava         

305
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,726
 into thin stands of stone wool 

306
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,195
          in a process          
that's like making cotton candy.

307
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,131
     the strands form tufts,    

308
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,267
  and a little binding solution 
      holds them together.      

309
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,703
         a spray of oil         
     adds water repellence.     

310
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,140
        now a fleecy web,       

311
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,542
 the stone wool rides a conveyor
  to the factory's upper level, 

312
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:03,548
         where it spills        
  into a huge pendulum device.  

313
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,950
 the pendulum swings to and fro 

314
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:10,088
     to layer the stone wool    
      in a zigzag pattern.      

315
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,690
  the number of layers varies,  

316
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,958
      depending on the kind     
    of insulation being made.   

317
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,095
   the now-layered stone wool   

318
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,698
     travels between rollers    
 that compress it substantially,

319
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,367
   adding density to the wool.  

320
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,504
        automated pushers       
  tuck in the pack on each side 

321
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,840
 as the wool enters a long oven.

322
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,509
    the heat cures the binder   
        applied earlier,        

323
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,646
 allowing the compressed fibers 
      to hold their shape.      

324
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,852
      the now-tighter pack      
  exits through a cooling zone  

325
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,254
   and travels under a roller   

326
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,790
    which squeezes it to make   
    the fibers more flexible.   

327
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,792
   circular blades then slice   

328
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,262
  the moving mass of stone wool 
           lengthwise.          

329
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:57,134
      a branding tool burns     
  the r-value and company name  

330
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,238
     onto the surface of the    
 insulation as it moves forward.

331
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:06,344
          robotic arms          
      swing back and forth      

332
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,548
    to slice the insulation     
    to its final dimensions.    

333
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,950
 instead of sharp, steel blades,

334
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:18,355
 these robots use high-pressure 
 water jets to make their cuts. 

335
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,158
    the jets do a precise job   

336
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,626
     without generating dust    
            or waste,           

337
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,897
   and the stone wool doesn't   
 absorb the water from the jets.

338
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,034
  the sheer density of the wool 
  makes it moisture-resistant,  

339
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,971
    along with the oil added    
 to the fibers during spinning. 

340
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,113
   to demonstrate stone wool's  
   water-repellent qualities,   

341
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,049
         they pour water        
   directly onto the surface.   

342
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:49,087
     there's no absorption.     
    the water just runs off.    

343
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,524
      in this routine test,     

344
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,927
   a worker torches the wool,   
   and it doesn't catch fire.   

345
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,798
           stone wool           
   can withstand temperatures   

346
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,067
     of almost 2,200 degrees    
           fahrenheit           

347
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,802
 due to its natural properties. 

348
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,273
   it's even cool to the touch  
       on the other side.       

349
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,876
        once it's passed        
 several quality-control tests, 

350
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,212
      the insulation heads      
     for the packaging line.    

351
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,684
     grippers pull on a roll    
   of plastic tube packaging,   

352
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,221
    and hot jaws cut and seal   
  one end to form an open bag.  

353
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,290
     mechanical fingers hold    
       the other end open       

354
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,226
     as machinery slides it     
       over a metal spout.      

355
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,896
a compressed stack of insulation
    is pushed into the spout.   

356
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,098
       the spout expands,       

357
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
 and the insulation is released 
          into the bag.         

358
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,238
    the spout then retracts,    
  and the process is repeated.  

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,174
      machinery heat-seals      
          the open end.         

360
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:47,645
   from a pile of basalt rock   
     and recycled steel slag    

361
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,781
  to a bag full of insulation,  

362
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:52,684
            it's been           
     a wild and woolly ride.    

363
