it draws in the knotted threads,

302
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,198
which pull in the unknotted ones.      

303
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,801
then the machine begins braiding a continuous     

304
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:23,104
round shoelace cord.      

305
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:27,141
these wheels apply tension   
to pull any loose braids tighter

306
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:29,611
so that the corrected diameter is uniform.      

307
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:34,314
the finished cord, which is about a mile long,  

308
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:37,552
collects in a barrel.     

309
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,520
some shoelaces are made of knitted,          

310
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:41,789
rather than braided, cord.   

311
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,326
the cones of thread feed the knitting machine directly. 

312
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:48,196
the machine's four latch needles can perform two types 

313
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,698
of knitting stitches to produce round cord.     

314
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,269
once the knitted, or braided, cord is ready,         

315
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:59,740
a worker adjusts four metal pegs
of a winding device      

316
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:02,976
to the shoelace length they're making.        

317
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:07,748
then she winds the cord    
around the pegs up to 250 times,

318
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,617
depending on the cord diameter.

319
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:16,758
she cuts the end and ties the cords together       

320
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,825
so that she can easily transfer them         

321
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,028
to what's called a tipping machine.       

322
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,065
♪♪         

323
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:33,274
she runs the center of each cord

324
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:36,410
over an acetone-saturated felt pad,           

325
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:38,880
then inserts it in the machine's die.     

326
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:43,151
the die wraps a piece of acetate
film tightly around the cord, 

327
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,885
then cuts it in the middle,  

328
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,121
producing a shoelace with a stiff tip,       

329
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,691
called an aglet, on each end. 

330
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:55,028
this press applies a nickel-plated steel tip,   

331
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,799
a kind used on bag drawstrings.

332
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:02,837
the worker manually positions two tips directly on the cord 

333
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,806
with a slight gap in between them.        

334
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:10,444
she activates the press to force them on,       

335
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:12,380
then cuts the cord in the gap. 

336
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:16,317
this factory also makes rickrack,           

337
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,288
a flat zigzag trim that's sewn onto clothing.   

338
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,393
these rickrack-braiding machines are 120 years old.  

339
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:29,096
each one holds from 13 to 73 bobbins of thread.    

340
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:34,235
the more bobbins used, the wider the rickrack.    

341
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,970
there are two ways to make multicolored rickrack     

342
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,206
or braided shoelace cord.   

343
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,575
mount different shades of solid color bobbins     

344
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:42,142
on the braiding machine    

345
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:45,579
or wind multicolored thread on each bobbin.     

346
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:48,282
and for multicolored knitted shoelace cord,     

347
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:52,653
mount different shades of solid-color thread cones  

348
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:55,389
or multicolored thread on each cone.      

349
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,724
to produce different shapes and sizes,       

350
00:20:56,726 --> 00:21:00,494
this manufacturer uses different types of braiding  

351
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:01,862
and knitting machines,     

352
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:04,065
varying the number of bobbins or cones      

353
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:06,934
from eight to as many as 73.  

354
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,436
an even number produces a round shoelace.       

355
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,806
an odd number produces a flat one.          

356
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:13,741
with so many possibilities,  

357
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:17,044
shoelaces can be fashionable as well as functional.
