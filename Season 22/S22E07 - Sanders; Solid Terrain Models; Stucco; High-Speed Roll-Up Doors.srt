   discovery communications     

3
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,655
     narrator: most experts     
  will tell you that the key    

4
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,324
    to the perfect paint job    
    or wood-refinishing job     

5
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,058
is to prep the surface properly 

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,995
   before applying the paint    
        or wood stain.          

7
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,131
     that requires sanding      
    to remove old finishes      

8
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,066
  and to level uneven areas.    

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,038
   the easiest way to do that   
  is with a motorized sander.   

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,543
  professional-caliber sanders  
   are typically pneumatic,     

11
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,612
     meaning you plug them      
    into an air compressor.     

12
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,482
   air-driven tools are more    
      powerful than tools       

13
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,084
   than run on electricity.     

14
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:28,086
 this type of sander is called  
       a straight line,         

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,756
        because the pad         
 to which you attach sandpaper  

16
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,291
    moves in a straight line    
        back and forth.         

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,762
 many of the tool's components  
  are made of powdered metal,   

18
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,165
         then machined          
      to exact dimensions       

19
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,167
  on a computer-guided lathe.   

20
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,968
 powdered metal is iron powder  

21
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,237
        that's compacted        
      with high pressure        

22
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,241
and heated in a furnace to bond 
   the particles into a solid   
             part.              

23
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,444
     sometimes they further     
 strengthen the powdered metal  

24
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,448
   by infusing it with copper   
        in the furnace.         

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,250
  using an induction welder,    

26
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,720
     which heats the metal      
   with an electric current,    

27
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:04,056
they fuse a powdered-metal gear 
 to each end of a steel shaft   

28
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:07,393
     by melting on silver.      

29
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,062
  this constructs the sander's  
      timing driveshaft,        

30
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,797
   the regulating component     

31
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,600
     that makes each stroke     
      of the sanding pad        

32
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,536
   just under an inch long.     

33
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,005
 heating the metal softens it,  

34
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,875
  so they now cool the timing   
      driveshaft in oil.        

35
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,679
     this quenching hardens     
        the component.          

36
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:30,349
      meanwhile, they coat      
a sheet of aluminum rectangles  

37
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,952
    with industrial-strength    
       contact adhesive.        

38
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:37,022
    each rectangle is a base    
   for a rubber sanding pad.    

39
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:41,694
the rectangular pad, which they 
 coat with the same adhesive,   

40
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:46,365
  is 6 1/2 millimeters thick,   
the same dimensions as the base 

41
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,700
      with identical holes      
   for the mounting screws.     

42
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:54,172
    once the adhesive becomes   
             tacky,             
they mate the base to the pad.  

43
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,241
using a small pneumatic press,  

44
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,745
   they force out trapped air   
  to ensure a thorough bond.    

45
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,650
   elsewhere in the factory,    

46
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,453
           they paint           
    the recessed lettering      

47
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,856
    of the polished aluminum    
             plates,            
        two per sander,         

48
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,925
           which bear           
   the manufacturer's name.     

49
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,931
     once all the remaining     
   components are prepared,     

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,734
technicians begin the assembly. 

51
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,138
  first, the motor's piston.    

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,740
   they place the piston rack   
       in an arbor press        

53
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,810
    and push a plastic piece    
        onto each end.          

54
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,680
    then, on each end piece,    
   they mount a piston ring     

55
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:40,086
     made of a proprietary      
   wear-resistant material.     

56
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,555
          they insert           
   the now-assembled piston     

57
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,291
       into the sander's        
     aluminum motor block.      

58
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,894
 the ring creates a tight seal  
    to prevent air leakage.     

59
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:53,232
  next, a technician installs   
     the timing driveshaft      

60
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,834
   and the idler gear shaft,    

61
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:58,504
   pressing the gears of both   
 into the piston rack's teeth.  

62
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:02,174
       the powdered-metal       
          counterweight         
       goes on each side        

63
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,176
  to balance the piston rack,   

64
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,513
    then guides made of that    
     proprietary material       

65
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,483
     to align and lubricate     
      the counterweights.       

66
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,654
    a second set of anti-wear   
             guides             

67
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,257
     goes in the lower part     
      of the motor block.       

68
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,293
       these help balance       
       the sanding pad.         

69
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,730
         then the start         
     of the valve system,       

70
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,335
  which controls the entry of   
compressed air into the sander. 

71
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,537
    at the front of the motor   
             block,             

72
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,807
  they install a paper gasket   
    to prevent air leakage,     

73
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,543
          then seal it          
  with an aluminum end plate.   

74
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,078
        continuing with         
       the valve system,        

75
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,747
 they install the components,   

76
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:45,484
which control the timing of the 
pistons' back-and-forth motion. 

77
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,753
     after sealing the top      
          with a cap,           

78
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,090
   they install the air-valve   
    block, then the handle,     

79
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,691
   which contains the inlet     

80
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,160
  to which the air compressor   
           connects.            

81
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,561
  the handle squeeze trigger    

82
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,664
     is mounted to the cap      
       above the handle.        

83
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,069
 they install the counterweight 
         for the pad.           

84
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:11,510
    here, you can see the two   
             shafts             
   the piston rack rotates.     

85
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:15,247
      workers connect them      
  to an aluminum drive shoe,    

86
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,449
which will move back and forth. 

87
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,186
   a pair of side rails holds   
   the drive shoe in place.     

88
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,856
 where the air exits the tool,  

89
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,292
  they install a muffler made   
      of porous plastic.        

90
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,796
 finally, when the technician   

91
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,932
        screws the base         
      to the drive shoe,        

92
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,599
    the chain is complete.      

93
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,871
    compressed air moves the    
             piston,            
   which rotates the shafts,    

94
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,872
  which moves the drive shoe    

95
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,742
     holding the rubber pad     
        with sandpaper.         

96
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,745
     this pneumatic sander      
       is ready to level        

97
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,548
      and smooth a surface      
       in seconds flat.         

98
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,832
    narrator: a solid terrain   
             model,             
       "stm" for short,         

99
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,502
is an exact, three-dimensional, 
       miniature replica        

100
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,103
     of a geographic area.      

101
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,575
  stms are indispensable tools  
 for museums, visitor centers,  

102
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,312
  and for planning everything   
   from industrial projects     

103
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,881
    to military operations.     

104
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,319
    to create a solid terrain   
             model,             

105
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,457
   the first step is to gather  
              data              
 via satellites and aircraft.   

106
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:35,260
      two types of data --      
    color photographs of the    
            surface             

107
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:39,398
  showing the precise location  
of vegetation, rock, buildings, 

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,134
           and so on,           
  and elevation measurements,   

109
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,936
       taken with lasers        
     and other equipment.       

110
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,272
a cartographer digitally merges 

111
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,143
 the black and white elevation  
diagrams with the color photos  

112
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:54,613
   and adds artwork for roads   
       and place names.         

113
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:58,217
   he produces a 3-d computer   
              model             
         of the area.           

114
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,485
     this model will guide      
         the machines           

115
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,288
        that manufacture        
      the physical model        

116
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,824
         out of a block         
     of polyurethane foam.      

117
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,627
   foam is a durable material   
       and lightweight,         

118
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,029
     making the model easy      
         to transport.          

119
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,433
   a computer-guided cutting    
 machine first shapes a ledge   

120
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,568
 around the block's perimeter.  

121
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,638
      this is for mounting      
     the model on a frame.      

122
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,575
   then the machine reads the   
   computer model's elevation   
             files              

123
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,246
 and carves a miniature replica 
of those elevations into foam.  

124
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:31,784
     the machine first does     
         a rough cut.           

125
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:35,788
            then --             
 and this takes much longer --  

126
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,590
  it carves the fine details.   

127
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,992
  depending on the complexity   
        of the terrain,         

128
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,128
     cutting the elevations     
         into the foam          

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,131
   can take just a few hours    
       or several days.         

130
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,133
 when the cutting's finished,   

131
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,069
   the technician cleans off    
         the foam dust          

132
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,172
    with compressed air and a   
             brush.             

133
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,311
   the foam goes into a spray   
             booth              

134
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,147
    where it first receives     
       a coat of primer         

135
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,882
  to seal the porous surface,   

136
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,819
      then multiple layers      
      of special coatings       

137
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,389
   to make images printed on    
the surface sharp and vibrant.  

138
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,629
   once the coating's dry --    
   that takes about a day --    

139
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:22,167
 technicians put the model into 
                a               
custom-designed inkjet printer, 

140
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,638
    which reads the computer    
             model's            
       photograph file.         

141
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,774
just like an ordinary printer,  

142
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,910
     this printer produces      
     a multitude of shades      

143
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,112
from just four basic colors --  

144
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,649
    black, yellow, magenta,     
           and cyan.            

145
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,919
    the jets pass just a few    
 millimeters above the model,   

146
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,922
 emitting one microscopic drop  
       of ink at a time         

147
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,324
          at precisely          
     the correct location.      

148
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,794
         the end result         
    is a miniature replica      

149
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:52,664
 of what the surface looks like 
         in real life.          

150
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,266
   other workers, meanwhile,    

151
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,735
    construct a sturdy frame    
         for the model          

152
00:08:56,737 --> 00:09:00,072
      by gluing, clamping,      
     and nailing together       

153
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:01,940
     four lengths of oak.       

154
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:05,610
    this frame will protect     
     the model from damage      

155
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,813
       and make it easier       
       to lift and move.        

156
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:13,685
    once the glue dries, they   
             remove             
  the clamps, and with a saw,   

157
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,922
        trim each corner        
     to a 45-degree angle.      

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,761
   then they round the edges    
        with a sander.          

159
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,309
    they complete the frame     
    by protecting the wood      

160
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,344
          with a coat           
    of clear polyurethane.      

161
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,714
       when that dries,         

162
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,751
        they spread glue        
 onto the frame's inside edge.  

163
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,855
 then they position the model   

164
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,124
       so that the ledge        
      along its perimeter       

165
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,259
   sits on top of the frame.    

166
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,062
        after printing,         
     they spray the model       

167
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,264
    with clear polyurethane     
          or lacquer.           

168
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,600
     the protective finish      
         allows people          

169
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,203
     to now touch the model     
     without damaging it.       

170
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,805
       sometimes, an area       
they're modeling has buildings, 

171
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,808
 bridges, or other structures.  

172
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,343
     when that's the case,      

173
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,013
 an engineer designs a computer 
     model of the object.       

174
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,015
  then, guided by this model,   

175
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,619
     a 3-d printer produces     
     a physical model out of    
            plastic,            

176
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,887
building the miniature replica  

177
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,357
       from the bottom up       
   one thin layer at a time.    

178
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,294
   these mountaintop castles    
          in portugal           

179
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,563
    are the finishing touch     
         on this model          

180
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:36,701
  that's set to go on display   
 at the local tourist center.   

181
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:41,039
    solid terrain models are    
 a creative and valuable tool   

182
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,108
      for educating people      
        young and old.          

183
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,912
   by translating complicated   
        technical data          

184
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:50,248
       into a unique and        
   scientifically sound visual  
              aid,              

185
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,116
a solid terrain model delivers  

186
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,287
 a fascinating bird's-eye view  
       from the ground.         

187
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,608
    narrator: stucco is one     

188
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,210
   of the oldest construction   
   materials on the planet.     

189
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,012
   the earliest formulations    

190
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,615
  date back to ancient greece   
       and mayan mexico.        

191
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,350
   stucco has stuck around,     

192
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,887
   and as an exterior siding,   
     it's come a long way.      

193
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,925
      modern stucco is more     
           attractive           
 and offers better protection.  

194
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,829
        whether cement-         
       or acrylic-based,        

195
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,099
    stucco always starts out    
      as a sticky paste,        

196
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,102
   and that's the great thing   
         about stucco.          

197
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,705
  in this wet and gooey form,   
       it can be worked         

198
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,374
as it's applied to the exterior 
         of a building          

199
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,312
      to achieve a variety      
         of textures.           

200
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,580
     it hardens to provide      
       a tough exterior         

201
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,050
   that shields the building    
     against the elements.      

202
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,523
to mass-produce cement stucco,  

203
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,393
      they start with tons      
        of silica sand.         

204
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,796
 they unload it into a conveyor 
     and elevator system,       

205
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,467
   which delivers the sand to   
              silos             
   for storage until needed.    

206
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,206
 they select sand with various  
     grades of coarseness       

207
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,674
for different stucco finishes.  

208
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:27,278
 they mix it with cement, lime, 
     and other ingredients      

209
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,481
  to create the stucco base.    

210
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,954
 a technician demonstrates how  
 the ingredients come together  

211
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,090
using this research lab mixer.  

212
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,625
           she blends           
   all the ingredients dry,     

213
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:45,430
 achieving a consistency that's 
similar to cake mix from a box. 

214
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,233
         cement stucco          
     is sold in dry form.       

215
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:52,971
 water will be added to liquefy 
   the ingredients on the job   
             site.              

216
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:58,110
     in this demonstration,     
    she also adds pigment.      

217
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,845
 with the stucco pre-colored,   

218
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,047
    there's no need to paint    
         the building.          

219
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:12,857
 to mass-produce cement stucco, 
   they use this mega-mixer.    

220
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,661
the operator adds three or four 
      different pigments        

221
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,531
    to create a custom color    
   in the dry stucco batch.     

222
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,334
      large paddle blades       
      spiral vigorously.        

223
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,871
            usually,            
  this is a closed operation,   

224
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:30,075
    but they've opened it up    
        for our camera.         

225
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,477
after three minutes of mixing,  

226
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,814
  the dry stucco mix is ready   
         for scrutiny.          

227
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,084
  an employee takes a sample    

228
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,387
  and sends it to the quality   
  control lab for evaluation.   

229
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,561
   at the lab, the technician   
   weighs the stucco mixture    

230
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,562
        and adds water.         

231
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,700
 he keeps an eye on the scale   

232
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,270
   to ensure that the amounts   
      are proportionate.        

233
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,643
         he mixes them          
and visually checks to confirm  

234
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:08,513
    that the pigment and raw    
 materials are well dispersed.  

235
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,116
        acrylic stucco,         
      on the other hand,        

236
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:14,386
           calls for            
 an entirely different recipe.  

237
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,655
   they use calcium carbonate   
    instead of silica send      

238
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,525
    and acrylic as a binder     
      instead of cement.        

239
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,260
    they mix it with water      

240
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,730
  and sell it wet in a bucket   
        instead of dry.         

241
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,734
     to color it, they use      
 a computerized tint machine,   

242
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:31,536
    similar to what you find    
       in a paint store.        

243
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,072
     they load the machine      
     with liquid pigments       

244
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,075
   and enter a color formula    
      into the computer.        

245
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,045
     it mixes the pigments      
  to produce the exact color.   

246
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,817
        and it releases         
  the precise amount needed.    

247
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,754
      they blend the color      
   into the acrylic stucco,     

248
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:52,623
     and the batch ends up      
    looking like blue mud.      

249
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,293
    it's now ready to apply     
          to a home.            

250
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,728
       no prep required.        

251
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,501
 they also sell acrylic stucco  
     with no color at all.      

252
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,101
    it's called tint base.      

253
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,838
   the pigments will be added   
       on the job site,         

254
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,241
   where they can be adjusted   
          if needed.            

255
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:13,978
     an airtight seal keeps     
    the stucco in its viscous   
             state.             

256
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,148
 acrylic stucco dries quickly,  
          like paint,           

257
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,918
      while cement stucco       
 takes 28 days to totally cure  

258
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,122
  into a more durable finish.   

259
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,057
over on the cement stucco line, 

260
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,860
       a rotating machine       
  handles all the packaging.    

261
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,197
   a suctioning device pulls    
   a paper bag into position    

262
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,201
         under a spout,         
    which then fills it up.     

263
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:40,005
    it takes just 8 seconds     
    to fill a 90-pound bag.     

264
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,608
         that works out         
 to over 1,300 bags per hour,   

265
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,412
enough material for 30 houses.  

266
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:54,051
 the machine transfers the bag  
     to the conveyor belt.      

267
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,222
    this stucco is now ready    
  to provide a strong finish    

268
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,690
     to building projects.      

269
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,825
           applied to           
    a building's exterior,      

270
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,763
 stucco can be textured to suit 
    the homeowner's taste,      

271
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:08,233
 and it will harden to provide  
the building with a tough skin. 

272
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:12,437
 that's why stucco continues to 
be part of the urban landscape. 

273
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,187
    narrator: an industrial     
 roll-up door opens and closes  

274
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,455
 at least three times as fast   

275
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,124
        as your average         
   residential garage door.     

276
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:37,929
     that means machines and    
            products            
     can be moved in and out    
            quickly.            

277
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,731
 these heavy-duty rubber doors  

278
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,268
 are also engineered for a good 
seal, so they're weathertight.  

279
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:52,076
   in many workplaces, doors    
are always opening and closing. 

280
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,546
   a high-speed roll-up door    
is designed for heavy traffic.  

281
00:16:55,548 --> 00:17:00,018
  coal mines, parking garages,  
 and large food freezer rooms   

282
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,054
  are just a few of the places  
 you will find them in action.  

283
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,759
they start with rubber panels.  

284
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,296
 their number and size depends  
   on the width of the door     

285
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:12,763
      being manufactured.       

286
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,701
  workers brush high-strength   
     epoxy onto the edges       

287
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,036
 to bind the panels together.   

288
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,706
      the epoxy will take       
  a couple of hours to cure,    

289
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,309
 so there's time to smooth out  
        the air bubbles         

290
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:28,446
    by applying pressure to     
the seams with a heavy roller.  

291
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,650
after the epoxy cures, they map 
  out areas with masking tape   

292
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,985
        to contain glue         

293
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:37,455
      for the application       
  of extruded rubber strips.    

294
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,857
       the horizontal one       
        is a stiffener,         

295
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,394
    and the vertical strips     
 at the sides are wind blocks.  

296
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,264
   they'll secure the curtain   
        to the building         

297
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,732
     even in bad weather.       

298
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,736
   the employee also applies    
synthetic fabric to both sides  

299
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,171
       to prevent wear.         

300
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,677
    he adds reflective yellow   
             strips             
     to the front and back      

301
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,681
 to make the black rubber door  
       visible at night.        

302
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:07,752
   a machine now drills holes   
       in a steel tube.         

303
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,153
    this tube is the header     

304
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,890
    that the rubber curtain     
   will be rolled up on to.     

305
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:16,394
     the holes will be used     
 to attach the curtain to it.   

306
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,703
      he tack-welds axles       
  onto both ends of the tube.   

307
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,839
   the axles will be attached   
      to mounting plates,       

308
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,641
 so these are critical welds.   

309
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,909
    he measures the axles to    
            confirm             

310
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,779
   that the assembly is level   
       and won't wobble.        

311
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,350
    satisfied, he welds them    
permanently to the steel tube.  

312
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,723
       next, he assembles       
   and welds the side frame     

313
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,391
    for the rubber curtain.     

314
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,666
   he assembles a hinge cover   
  to the front of the frame,    

315
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,935
     creating a compartment     
        for the curtain         

316
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,538
that can be opened when needed. 

317
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,675
    then it's on to the paint   
             booth.             

318
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,544
    here, an employee primes    
     the frame components       

319
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,914
 to protect them from rust and  
    then gives them a coat of   
             paint.             

320
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,421
       a worker assembles       
     the bottom beam now.       

321
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,490
   he bolts an aluminum track   
     for the rubber edging      

322
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,859
    to a heavy steel frame.     

323
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,769
       he screws the box        
 for the wireless transmitter   

324
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,438
 that opens and closes the door 
         to the beam.           

325
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,244
      two workers now pull      
       the rubber edging        

326
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,712
  through the aluminum track.   

327
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,848
     the edging is equipped     
 with an electric safety wire   

328
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,251
       to detect movement       
   and abort a door closing.    

329
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,987
    this will keep the door     
      from hitting anyone       

330
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,589
      who walks under it.       

331
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:56,661
     it's now time to pull      
     everything together.       

332
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,064
   the team screws the rubber   
  curtain to the steel tube,    

333
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,467
           making use           
  of those pre-drilled holes.   

334
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,976
  they move down and position   
the bottom beam on the curtain. 

335
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,919
 they attach it to the curtain  
 with numerous nuts and bolts.  

336
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,628
they roll up the rubber curtain 

337
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,264
    to prepare for assembly     
   to the mounting brackets.    

338
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,509
     with the attachments,      

339
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,845
     the curtain now weighs     
      over 1,100 pounds.        

340
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,315
      a crane transfers it      
  to the end mounting plates    

341
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,784
      and holds it steady       

342
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:56,053
      while workers slide       
    the end brackets onto the   
             axles.             

343
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,724
   they build a steel support   
 structure around the brackets  

344
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,059
  and the rolled-up curtain.    

345
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,599
     they attach the motor      
     to one of the axles.       

346
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,737
 this roll-up door is now ready 
         for delivery.          

347
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,406
    two days in the making,     

348
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,143
           it's ready           
  for whatever comes its way.   

349
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:33,391
    if you have any comments    
        about the show,
