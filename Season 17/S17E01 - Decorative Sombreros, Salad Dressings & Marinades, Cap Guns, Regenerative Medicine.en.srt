    discovery communications

00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:55,788
     narrator: the sombrero     
  is a traditional mexican hat  

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,924
    with a large brim that's    
 designed to cast a wide shadow 

5
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,526
  over the face and shoulders.  

6
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,062
       everyday sombreros       
       are made of straw,       

7
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,998
       but mariachi bands       
 and other folkloric performers 

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,201
        wear fancier ones       
 made of velvet, wool, or felt, 

9
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,837
   with elaborate decorations.  

10
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,344
     these fancy sombreros      
     are produced primarily     

11
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,479
          as decorative         
       tourist souvenirs.       

12
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:26,419
 artisans construct and decorate
   each one entirely by hand.   

13
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,555
    they start by positioning   
    a sun-shaped cutting die    

14
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,224
 at the center of a large sheet 
         of thick paper.        

15
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:37,196
  as the press closes, the die  
 slices through, making a hole. 

16
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,303
  next, they sandwich the sheet 

17
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:48,174
     between two fiery hot      
     sombrero-shaped forms.     

18
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:51,277
      these mold the paper      
 to the shape of the hat's brim.

19
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,985
  then they trim off the excess 

20
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:04,690
    and stitch the perimeter    
     to reinforce the edge.     

21
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,262
     now they soak the brim     
     in a gelatin solution      

22
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,499
and lay it out in the sun to dry
      to stiffen the paper.     

23
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:21,007
next, they fold a sheet of paper
   and die-cut another shape.   

24
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,343
 they sew the far ends together 
        to form a circle.       

25
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,748
     this will form the top     
of the sombrero, called the cup.

26
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:34,920
they spread glue along the base,
 where it attaches to the brim. 

27
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,291
      they also apply glue      
       to a paper circle.       

28
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,895
     then they place the cup    

29
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,198
      on the same hot form      
   they use to mold the brim.   

30
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:56,976
     after shaping the cup,     

31
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,079
     they reinforce the top     
     with the paper circle.     

32
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,593
          the sombrero          
    is now fully constructed.   

33
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,762
  the next step is to cover it  
           in fabric.           

34
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,532
they coat the surface with glue,

35
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:24,470
    then, section by section,   
adhere pieces of velvet or felt.

36
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,739
    they start with the cup.    

37
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:30,876
   the fabric has been pre-cut  
 and sewn to the correct shape. 

38
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,420
        the next section        
    is the brim's underside.    

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,635
 they trim off the excess fabric
      with a razor blade...     

40
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,275
         ...and cut away        
    the fabric over the cup.    

41
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,785
     next, a piece to cover     
      the top of the brim.      

42
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,987
         throughout the         
   fabric-application process,  

43
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,256
      he's careful to pull      
        the material taut       

44
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,259
       and smooth it down.      

45
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:27,099
      a final trimming, and     
 the sombrero is fully covered. 

46
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,739
    elsewhere in the factory,   
       automated machines       

47
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,142
          weave spools          
     of polypropylene string    

48
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:39,145
   and metallic plastic string  
       into colorful trim.      

49
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,485
            artisans            
  in the decoration department  

50
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:50,089
      cut out paper motifs      
     and cover them in trim.    

51
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:53,025
         then, they make        
       colorful appliqués       

52
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,294
by sewing the motifs and sequins

53
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,530
       onto velvet-covered      
          paper shapes.         

54
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,803
    they glue these appliqués   
       onto the sombrero.       

55
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,979
     finally, they glue trim    

56
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,382
    where the appliqué edges    
      and hat surface meet.     

57
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:21,187
    this holds the edges down   
  and finishes them off nicely. 

58
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,928
  on pricier sombreros, all the 
 decorations are sewn by hand --

59
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,963
     no glued-on appliqués.     

60
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,870
      the artisans complete     
         every sombrero         

61
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,271
     with the fabric lining     
           in the cup,          

62
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,074
     then an under-the-chin     
           drawstring,          

63
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:46,378
  handy for wearing or hanging  
      this mexican memento.     

64
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,564
            narrator:           
       supermarket shelves      

65
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,166
           are stocked          
      with a vast selection     

66
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:10,769
      of tasty, ready-made      
 salad dressings and marinades. 

67
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,972
  dressing adds instant pizzazz 
          to the salad,         

68
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,776
    whereas marinade flavors    
    and tenderizes raw food     

69
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,647
    by slow penetration over    
  a few hours prior to cooking. 

70
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,053
     salad dressings can be     
   cream- or mayonnaise-based   

71
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,589
    or oil-and-vinegar-based.   

72
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,058
      this particular line      
   of dressings and marinades   

73
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,128
       is made entirely of      
 certified organic ingredients. 

74
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,864
      it's also gluten-free     
         and sugar-free         

75
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:42,201
  for those with celiac disease 
          or diabetes.          

76
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:45,671
 while the salad dressing's base
      stays much the same,      

77
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:49,141
 the seasoning ingredients vary 
  to create different flavors,  

78
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,610
   such as the one we're about  
      to see being made --      

79
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,946
        sun-dried tomato        
     and garlic vinaigrette.    

80
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,350
    on the production floor,    
  they start by heating water,  

81
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,185
    then adding tomato paste.   

82
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,159
   next, they add dried basil.  

83
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,428
    they pour all ingredients   
    directly into the vortex    

84
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,432
  created by the mixing blade   
  to ensure thorough blending.  

85
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,336
         next, they add         
      sun-dried tomatoes...     

86
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,773
       ...minced garlic...      

87
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,109
          ...and salt.          

88
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,244
after 15 more minutes of mixing,

89
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,381
      they add soybean oil      
   and extra virgin olive oil,  

90
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,050
     both expeller-pressed,     

91
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,385
        meaning extracted       
    from the source naturally   

92
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,053
    using a mechanical press    

93
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,589
    and not the conventional    
        chemical process.       

94
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,859
       the last ingredient      
is gluten-free red wine vinegar.

95
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,063
        whereas the oils        
 provide both taste and texture,

96
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,799
      this vinegar produces     
      a full-bodied flavor.     

97
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,602
cooking another 20 minutes or so
          on high heat          

98
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,203
     stabilizes the product,    

99
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,808
    giving unopened dressing    
  a shelf life of up to a year. 

100
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,347
      on the bottling line,     
  a machine called the inverter 

101
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,384
  flips the empty glass bottles 
          upside down.          

102
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,621
     then, from underneath,     
          an air nozzle         

103
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,623
        shoots in a blast       
        of filtered air.        

104
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,294
  this loosens any dust or dirt 
  particles inside the bottle,  

105
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,697
        enabling a vacuum       
    to then suction them out.   

106
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,034
     another inverter flips     
 the bottles right side up again

107
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,769
          as they enter         
      the filling machine.      

108
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,380
 exiting the filler, the bottles
     pass through a machine     

109
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,382
  which dispenses plastic caps, 

110
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:41,253
  then, with a row of spinning  
     disks, twists them on.     

111
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,089
  finally, a tamper-proof seal  
           and labels.          

112
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,329
 the marinade-production process
        is much the same,       

113
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,731
 but with different ingredients,
           of course.           

114
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,467
           this batch           
   is sesame teriyaki flavor,   

115
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,537
    of which a key component    
     is gluten-free tamari,     

116
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,006
      a japanese soy sauce      
      made without wheat.       

117
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,811
  again, the process begins by  
 heating water in a cook kettle.

118
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,813
     they pump in tamari...     

119
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,484
         pour in salt...        

120
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,119
      then powdered ginger.     

121
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:19,357
       next, minced garlic      
        and sesame seeds.       

122
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:25,030
 then, agave nectar, a natural  
 sweetener that's low-glycemic. 

123
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,899
    they add pureed ginger...   

124
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,636
then, expeller-press soybean oil

125
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,106
     mixed with xanthan gum,    
      a natural thickener.      

126
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,509
    about 20 minutes' cooking   
          on high heat,         

127
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:41,446
    and this sesame teriyaki    
 marinade is ready for bottling.

128
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,448
 like before, the glass bottles 

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,384
    undergo a vacuum cleaning   
     en route to the filler.    

130
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,855
     there, pistons suck up     
  the marinade like a syringe,  

131
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,057
then inject it into the bottles.

132
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,805
       the filled bottles       
     go through the capper,     

133
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,741
 then travel on a conveyor belt 
      to the next machine,      

134
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,745
 which slips a plastic neckband 
         over each cap.         

135
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,088
a shot of hot steam shrinks the 
neckband tightly around the cap,

136
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,957
     creating a tamper seal.    

137
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,161
  finally, the labeling machine 

138
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,763
          applies glue          
  to the back of a paper label, 

139
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,366
          then wraps it         
   around the passing bottle.   

140
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,043
        besides flavoring       
    and tenderizing raw food    

141
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,645
         before cooking,        

142
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,846
   you can also pour marinade   

143
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:52,184
 over meat, fish, or vegetables 
         while cooking,         

144
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:56,355
      a surefire way to let     
 the gourmet out of the bottle. 

145
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,209
            narrator:           
   a cap gun is a toy revolver  

146
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,810
      which, when you pull      
          its trigger,          

147
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,213
    makes an explosive sound    
         like a gunshot         

148
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,481
and emits a small puff of smoke.

149
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,150
           the caps --          
     tiny dots of gunpowder     

150
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,552
    on either a plastic ring    

151
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,754
       or a strip of paper      
     inserted in the gun --     

152
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,124
produce these realistic effects.

153
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,298
   cowboy-style cap guns were   
 the rage in the 1950s and '60s 

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,168
      during the golden age     
          of westerns.          

155
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,036
   this small american factory  

156
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,439
  uses the molds the major toy  
 companies of the day discarded 

157
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,843
    when they stopped making    
       cap guns long ago.       

158
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,979
      caps are little dots      
          of gunpowder          

159
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,381
      about 1/16 of an inch     
          in diameter,          

160
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,984
  sandwiched between two strips 
            of paper.           

161
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,386
       pulling the trigger      
       releases a hammer,       

162
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,755
     which strikes the cap,     
          exploding it.         

163
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,797
 this injection-molding machine 
        makes the grips,        

164
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,000
  the faces of the gun handle.  

165
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,801
  it shoots hot liquid plastic  

166
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,204
       into 10 grip molds       
         simultaneously.        

167
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:23,075
the plastic cools and solidifies
        in just seconds.        

168
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,413
  the color and design of grips 
         vary by model.         

169
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,384
 the ones on this rancher-style 
 cap gun feature a steer's head.

170
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,290
       the rest of the gun      
      is made of cast zinc.     

171
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,093
     workers load a zinc bar    
       into a smelting pot      

172
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,228
         heated to about        
     750 degrees fahrenheit.    

173
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,699
          the bar melts         
   within a couple of minutes.  

174
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,302
 the molten zinc travels through
   heated pipes to a plunger,   

175
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,840
     which injects the zinc     
     into a gun-parts mold.     

176
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:59,778
 the zinc takes just 10 seconds 
       to cool and harden.      

177
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,048
    then it's just a matter     
    of separating the parts.    

178
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,449
      the gun's main body,      

179
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,785
  which contains the right side 
        of the barrel...        

180
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,321
        the loading gate,       
   which covers the cap box...  

181
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,789
         the cylinder...        

182
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,924
 the left side of the barrel... 

183
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,593
         and toy bullets        
  which load into the cartridge 

184
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,595
 but don't shoot out of the gun.

185
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,733
     the trigger and hammer     
  are cast in a separate mold.  

186
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,735
    every piece has flashing,   

187
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,603
          excess metal          
      that forms in the gap     

188
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,806
     between the two halves     
          of the mold.          

189
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,875
     after removing as much     
    as they can with pliers,    

190
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,145
   workers file down the rest.  

191
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:40,085
some flashing is quite thick, so
they use a sander to remove it. 

192
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,755
 workers rinse the smooth parts 
 in acid to clean the surface,  

193
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,224
     then electroplate them     
           with zinc.           

194
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,760
       they dip the parts       
    in a clear liquid coating   

195
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:52,097
 to make the mat surface shiny. 

196
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,732
     now assembly can begin.    

197
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,905
 first, they install the spring 
 which opens the loading gate.  

198
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,177
     they take the left side    
         of the barrel,         

199
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,846
    add the latch that holds    
    the loading gate closed     

200
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,051
    and the spring which puts   
     tension on that latch.     

201
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:17,255
       then the cylinder,       
 and, finally, the guiding disk 

202
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,726
    which turns the cylinder    
  when you squeeze the trigger. 

203
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,194
       they screw all that      
        to the main body,       

204
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,731
  which contains the right side 
         of the barrel.         

205
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,870
        next, they insert       
  an orange plastic safety tip  

206
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,872
   into the end of the barrel.  

207
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,340
        laws require this       
       to prevent cap guns      

208
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,946
       from being mistaken      
       for real firearms.       

209
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,015
   they hook the loading-gate   
   spring to the gate's latch   

210
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,885
       to hold it closed.       

211
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,654
       then, they install       
      the hammer spring...      

212
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,492
         ...and hammer.         

213
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,429
    two brass grommets secure   
    the cylinder-turning arm    

214
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,165
   and the pusher which feeds   
       the caps one by one      

215
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,034
       out of the cap box       
     into striking position.    

216
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,770
the trigger spring keeps tension

217
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,840
     on both the cap pusher     
        and the trigger.        

218
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,911
       next, they install       
       the loading gate.        

219
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,319
        after hooking up        
       additional springs,      

220
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,454
   workers attach the top part  
      of the hammer spring      

221
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,058
       to the holding pin       
        on the hammer...        

222
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,193
      then, the bottom part     
      of the hammer spring      

223
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,063
to the holding pin on the frame.

224
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:37,436
  finally, the plastic grips -- 
one for each side of the handle.

225
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,347
 being cast from vintage molds, 

226
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,416
         these cap guns         
  feature intricate scrollwork, 

227
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,354
    a degree of craftsmanship   
 rarely seen in toys nowadays --

228
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,890
    something perhaps better    
   appreciated by the parents   

229
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,559
    of the wild west cowboys    

230
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,395
     than by the pint-sized     
     gunslingers themselves.    

231
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,651
            narrator:           
  when parts of the human body  

232
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,787
   break down or are damaged,   
      options are limited.      

233
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,657
    scientists are working on   
   providing replacement parts  

234
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,927
    on demand, like fingers,    
       ears, and bladders.      

235
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,795
 laboratory-engineered bladders 

236
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,464
 have already been successfully 
      implanted in humans.      

237
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,536
  the stuff of science fiction  
     may soon be a reality.     

238
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,474
     they begin with a mold,    

239
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,810
   a finger mold on the right   
     and an ear on the left.    

240
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:55,680
    these molds could be made   
      of synthetic polymers     

241
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,482
      or natural materials      
        such as collagen.       

242
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,153
 scientists will grow real cells
          on the molds.         

243
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,755
     to obtain those cells,     

244
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,958
   a scientists first extracts  
   a small piece of cartilage,  

245
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,827
  which is a type of connective 
       tissue in the body.      

246
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,030
 she chops it into little bits. 

247
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,233
    she transfers the minced    
    cartilage to a test tube    

248
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,569
        partially filled        
     with a special enzyme.     

249
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,437
  this enzyme dissolves tissue, 

250
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,773
          leaving only          
      the cartilage cells.      

251
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,242
  she then places the test tube 
         in a centrifuge        

252
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,378
     for a high-speed spin.     

253
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,512
 this causes the cartilage cells

254
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,582
           to separate          
    from the enzyme solution    

255
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,384
    and settle on the bottom.   

256
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,386
   she siphons off the liquid,  

257
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,522
       and the tiny cells       
    remain in the test tube.    

258
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:41,393
  next, she adds a red liquid.  

259
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,660
     it's a culture medium.     

260
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,797
   it will act as a fertilizer  
    to stimulate cell growth.   

261
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,599
  transferred to a petri dish,  

262
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,669
       she swishes the mix      
     to dispense the cells.     

263
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,870
   then it's into an incubator  

264
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,341
     warmed to 98.6 degrees     
  fahrenheit, body temperature. 

265
00:17:56,343 --> 00:18:00,478
  it's the perfect environment  
    to spur more cell growth.   

266
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,148
           meanwhile,           
  a computer-controlled machine 

267
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,350
   builds the mold of the ear.  

268
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,218
   it layers synthetic polymer  

269
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,688
           to produce           
   an authentic-looking shape.  

270
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,427
       this process takes       
       about five hours.        

271
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,765
in the meantime, the microscopic
cells have multiplied 20 times. 

272
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,502
    the scientist drips them    
    onto the completed mold,    

273
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,571
  where they continue to grow.  

274
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,107
         in the future,         
     cell-covered ear molds     

275
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,309
       could be implanted       
     under a patient's skin.    

276
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,110
      cartilage would form,     

277
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,947
    and the body would accept   
      the part as its own.      

278
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,251
        other scientists        

279
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,455
     are working on growing     
 blood vessels and heart valves.

280
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,658
 they start by extracting a type
 of stem cell from human blood. 

281
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,061
         the researcher         
     first fills a test tube    

282
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,797
         with the clear,        
     high-density solution.     

283
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,700
     he adds diluted blood      
     to the clear solution.     

284
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,871
 almost instantly, the different
     components of the blood    

285
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,875
       begin to separate.       

286
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,343
   the heavier red blood cells  
             plummet            

287
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,981
 and the lighter stem cells rise
  to the top of the test tube.  

288
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,287
    a spin in the centrifuge    

289
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,622
      leaves the components     
       visibly separated,       

290
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,493
 allowing scientists to retrieve
       the desired cells.       

291
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,230
      they'll convert them      
      to endothelial cells,     

292
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,566
    which line the inside of    
 blood vessels and heart valves.

293
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,903
 in the meantime, they construct
     the blood-vessel mold.     

294
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:35,240
   the scientist adds solvent   
       to liquid collagen,      

295
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,442
           causing it           
     to instantly dissolve.     

296
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,646
   he adds little white beads.  

297
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,214
   they're synthetic polymers.  

298
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,988
 and they liquefy over a period 
        of about an hour.       

299
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,726
     they spray the collagen    
concoction onto a rod that spins

300
00:19:54,728 --> 00:20:00,198
     as a carriage moves it     
  to and fro for even coverage. 

301
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,867
the collagen-and-polymer mixture

302
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,437
       quickly solidifies       
         around the rod.        

303
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,876
    the scientist slides off    
  the now-hardened biomaterial. 

304
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,214
  he now has a mold for shaping 
      a human blood vessel.     

305
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,420
   he coats the mold with the   
 microscopic endothelial cells, 

306
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,090
    which, by now, have grown   
         and multiplied.        

307
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,692
 he then pumps fluid through it 
     to simulate blood flow.    

308
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,629
    this conditions the cells   
       to go with the flow      

309
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,700
    and collectively operate    
    as a real blood vessel.     

310
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,970
   to grow a heart valve, they  
 don't actually build a mold -- 

311
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,772
      they use a real valve     
           from a pig.          

312
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,975
          the scientist         
      plunges the pig valve     

313
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,644
        into a container        
  filled with a mild detergent. 

314
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,247
     it goes into a machine     
       that shakes it up.       

315
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,316
  the agitation helps scrub off 
           the cells,           

316
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,720
leaving only the valve skeleton.

317
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,857
 he saturates the valve skeleton
        with human cells,       

318
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,159
   where they grow and thrive.  

319
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,065
     the research team then     
 pumps fluid through the valve, 

320
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,268
       just like they did       
     with the blood vessel.     

321
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,469
      this trains the cells     
         to do the work         

322
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,973
      they would need to do     
       in the human body.       

323
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,044
      even dr. frankenstein     
       would be impressed.
