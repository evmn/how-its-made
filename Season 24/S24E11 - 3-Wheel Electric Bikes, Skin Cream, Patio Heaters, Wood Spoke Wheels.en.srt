00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,854
narrator: in 1895, ogden bolton jr.   

4
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,989
registered one of the first patents      

5
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,191
for an electric bicycle in the u.s.          

6
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,726
a century later,        

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,995
they've become one of the most popular electric vehicles   

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,264
in the world.         

9
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,732
using electricity to enhance performance,    

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,569
the e-bike is definitely in the current. 

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,542
these electric three-wheel trikes combine ergonomic design

12
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,079
with cutting-edge mechanical engineering.    

13
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,083
a rechargeable battery powers the electric engine.      

14
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,354
the rider sits comfortably in the ergonomic seat,     

15
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,290
places his feet on the pedals, 

16
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,259
releases the parking brake,  

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,961
and takes off.         

18
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,832
the process begins with a water jet cutter.

19
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,102
it uses ultra-high-pressure water and sand         

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,705
to cut parts out of a thin aluminum sheet. 

21
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,442
the cutter significantly enhances productivity     

22
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,777
without sacrificing precision. 

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,115
it can make several parts out of a single sheet of aluminum. 

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,922
parts that are ready for assembly          

25
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,825
go to the cnc brake press for folding.          

26
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,998
a stopper positions the piece on the v die,         

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,235
where a punch comes down to fold it.     

28
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,273
a worker inspects the folded part    

29
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,610
to make sure it's ready for assembly.    

30
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:32,584
a cnc bender curves aluminum extrusion tubes for the frame. 

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,220
this machine has        

32
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,623
multidirectional bending capabilities          

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,326
and can make multiple bends to a single extrusion tube.  

34
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:49,234
the trike frame assembly process
starts on a jig.        

35
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,169
once all the tubes are in place,         

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,640
a welder spot-welds the aluminum brackets.     

37
00:02:54,642 --> 00:03:01,380
he welds about 20 spots, bonding
the brackets to the tubes.   

38
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,248
the tubes bear most of the load

39
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,518
while the brackets keep the frame aligned.    

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,255
the worker uses an electric tig-welding torch 

41
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,391
to complete the welding.    

42
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,393
he welds at a low temperature to avoid heat deformation   

43
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,996
in the metal.         

44
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:22,267
a mechanic installs thermoformed
recyclable abs plastic     

45
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,470
over the back frame tubes.   

46
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,005
he assembles the rear wheels, 

47
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,541
which have a seven-degree negative camber angle     

48
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,478
for better grip and handling. 

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
the mechanic mounts brake levers,         

50
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,351
gear shifters, and handle grips
onto the steering bar     

51
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,486
and tightens the six-point socket nuts   

52
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,121
with an allen wrench.     

53
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,830
he applies a structural adhesive
on the drop-out poles     

54
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,633
and in slots located on the front frame tubes.   

55
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,636
the adhesive provides the flexibility and strength  

56
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,573
needed to keep the drop-out poles in position.

57
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,716
now, the mechanic assembles the
front and back frames together.

58
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,851
the two frames connect under the seat     

59
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,188
through an integrated direction
pivot and suspension system.  

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,859
the mechanic slips the front wheel into the drop-out poles 

61
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,660
on the frame.         

62
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:28,066
he uses a calibrated torque wrench to tight the wheel nut. 

63
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,870
he assembles the three-cog front
cassette to the bottom bracket, 

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,805
then bolts on the pedal crank arm     

65
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,942
using a threaded taper pin system.  

66
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,683
next he installs the derailleur
for the nine-gear cassette   

67
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,286
and bolts it on with a lock-tight bolt. 

68
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,893
the compact drivetrain makes the trike 15%      

69
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,064
more energy-efficient than regular bicycles or tricycles. 

70
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,905
a mechanic installs the disc brake system     

71
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,574
on the front wheel electric hub

72
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,779
and verifies          
that it is functioning properly.

73
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,382
the seats are made of woven synthetic fabric   

74
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,650
wrapped around the frame    

75
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,119
and tightened with bungee elastics.     

76
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:28,993
he locks the removable battery pack in place with a key.   

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,996
a console indicates levels of electrical assistance    

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,533
and battery regeneration.   

79
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:38,670
this trike's wheel base    
allows it to ride on bike paths.

80
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,208
when on the road, its width takes up more space. 

81
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,876
the design of this electric trike     

82
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:49,848
combines stability and safety for a secure and pleasant ride.

83
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,758
narrator: the easiest way   

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,363
to treat dry skin       
is to spread on some skin cream.

85
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,030
it rejuvenates the skin cells 

86
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,166
and acts as a protective barrier.    

87
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,568
this is particularly important in the winter,         

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,637
when cold outdoor air and indoor heating       

89
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,140
suck the moisture out of your skin.       

90
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,778
if you have dry skin,     

91
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,416
it's wise to keep a good supply
of skin cream on hand.     

92
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,790
it's not just dry air     
that makes skin flaky and itchy.

93
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,527
cancer treatments can also dry out the skin,       

94
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,997
along with other medical conditions, like diabetes.   

95
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,868
the first ingredient is stearic acid.        

96
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,605
it's a wax derived from palm tree oil.  

97
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:51,276
the next ingredient is refined lanolin.      

98
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,945
it's blended with isopropyl myristate,   

99
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,816
a natural oil that helps soften
the stearic acid.       

100
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,486
these ingredients make up what's
called the oil-soluble phase  

101
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,488
of the recipe.         

102
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,025
workers heat the stearic acid until it liquefies,      

103
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,695
then add the blend of lanolin and isopropyl myristate    

104
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,764
and keep heating.       

105
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,033
while the oil phase is heating,

106
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:19,037
they prepare the water-soluble phase of the recipe.      

107
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,774
the first ingredient is glycerin
derived from a vegetable source,

108
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,043
such as corn.         

109
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:29,647
they heat and mix it, then add purified water.    

110
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,715
they continue heating     

111
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,318
the mixture          
to just below the boiling point,

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,386
add a floral fragrance,    

113
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,790
then pump the oil phase into the bottom of the tank.  

114
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,191
it blends in with the water phase      

115
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,529
while naturally rising to the top.          

116
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,597
they gradually lower the temperature.        

117
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,868
this makes the mixture creamy and bright white.    

118
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,740
after an hour of mixing, the skin cream is ready.    

119
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,275
they pump it out of the mixing tank     

120
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,145
to supply tanks that feed the filling line.       

121
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,020
this company packages its skin cream in jars         

122
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,190
for body cream and tubes for hand cream.        

123
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,964
workers unpack boxes      
of plastic jars and line them up

124
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,368
on a conveyer belt       
that feeds the labeling machine.

125
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,971
each jar passes a photo-eye sensor.      

126
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,841
this sensor triggers the machines to spin the jar  

127
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,109
at the same speed       

128
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,712
as the adhesive label coming off the roll.      

129
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,120
workers place the labeled jars 

130
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,123
onto a turntable that feeds the filling machine.

131
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,097
two single-file lanes each lead to three nozzles.  

132
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,738
the machine fills up to 125 jars per minute,    

133
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,709
depositing 12 ounces of skin cream into each jar.  

134
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,282
the two lanes of filled jars  

135
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,019
merge as they approach the capping machine.      

136
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:21,292
the caps come down a chute to the machine's carousel.   

137
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,829
a device called a timing screw correctly positions each jar  

138
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,298
to receive a lid.       

139
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,302
the lower part of the machine 

140
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:35,473
holds the jar steady as an arm secures the lid in place.   

141
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,515
the next station on the line applies an adhesive label   

142
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,317
onto the cap.         

143
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,388
the jars of body cream are ready for sale.      

144
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,591
this factory also packages hand cream in a tube 

145
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,627
that you can keep in your purse or pocket.    

146
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,798
a mechanical arm        

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,735
places the tubes on a turntable, cap side down. 

148
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,139
the bottom of each tube is open and ready for filling. 

149
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:19,451
a nozzle squirts two ounces of skin cream into the tube.  

150
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,158
then the machine heats the open
end to soften the plastic,   

151
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,226
clamps it shut,        

152
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,962
then cools the plastic to a solid state.       

153
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,902
when you rub the cream on your skin,         

154
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,103
the key ingredients,      

155
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,907
glycerin and lanolin, pack a one-two punch.     

156
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:44,643
glycerin is hydroscopic,    

157
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:48,380
meaning it draws water from the air to the skin.   

158
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,114
lanolin smoothes the skin,   

159
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,485
forming a protective film to lock in the moisture.    

160
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,329
narrator: patio heaters make it possible 

161
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,332
to dine outside even when it's cold.      

162
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,934
when this outdoor space heater is turned on,         

163
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,136
it creates a circle of warmth. 

164
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,939
the heater can take the chill out of a cold summer evening  

165
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,143
and extend patio season well into the fall.      

166
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,752
it's a chill day, but not on this patio.     

167
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,754
it has its own microclimate,  

168
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,223
one that's warm and toasty.  

169
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,527
it's all thanks        
to the infrared heater overhead.

170
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,898
to make a patio heater,    

171
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,368
an engineer first maps out the design on a computer. 

172
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,770
he transfers the design to cutting equipment,     

173
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,307
like this laser.        

174
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,042
it cuts screw holes and vents 

175
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,446
into steel that's covered by a protective plastic film. 

176
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,981
the laser also cuts a part   

177
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,151
that will be shaped      
into the patio heater's housing.

178
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,459
after removing the plastic film,

179
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,861
a worker places the steel between the jaws        

180
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,466
of a press brake.       

181
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:18,136
it bends the part to form a rim around the edges.

182
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:22,807
additional bends give the part a rounded profile.       

183
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,476
a laser probe checks that the worker's fingers   

184
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,846
are not getting too close to the jaws.          

185
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,685
once all the parts have been cut and shaped,   

186
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:38,690
the patio heater is ready to be assembled.   

187
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,292
a worker creates a reflector that will direct heat     

188
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,561
down and out of the unit.   

189
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,634
then he attaches an insulator to the reflector.       

190
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,901
it will protect the roof    

191
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:56,774
and walls that the heater will be mounted to.      

192
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,445
he inserts the insulator and reflector assembly.     

193
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,381
the legs of the reflector assembly fit 

194
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,950
into the laser-cut holes in the housing.        

195
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,255
he temporarily places the control box cover     

196
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,923
at the end of the housing.   

197
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,161
then he aligns and welds a side panel to the housing.  

198
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,469
he welds a second panel to the other side.       

199
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,143
after covering the assembly with protective plastic again, 

200
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,678
he grinds down the welded seam.

201
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,016
this gives the patio heater unit cleaner edges.      

202
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,689
he buffs the seams to a low sheen using a cloth wheel   

203
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,491
and polishing paste.      

204
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,696
this makes the seams blend in with the steel.       

205
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,164
the burner is next.      

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,498
it's made of steel       

207
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,437
but has a ceramic grill with hundreds of tiny holes.  

208
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,638
this contoured pattern     

209
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,576
allows heat to radiate in all directions. 

210
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,045
he tucks insulation      

211
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:11,783
into the heater body to protect
it from the hot burner.    

212
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,186
then he installs the burner on top of the insulation.   

213
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:19,524
it fits snugly to the reflector
and insulator framework.    

214
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,527
he places a separator at one end of the burner,   

215
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,797
leaving a space for a control box and gas line.

216
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,133
he inserts the control box   

217
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:33,337
and connects the gas line to the burner.         

218
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,006
he attaches the spark igniter 

219
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,642
and temperature sensor to the separator.       

220
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:51,956
he secures the burner to the main assembly with screws. 

221
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,293
he tucks the electronic controls
into the control box      

222
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,528
and connects all of the wiring.

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,208
he seals the control box with 
a metal plate and rubber gasket.

224
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,045
this makes the electronics watertight.          

225
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,782
finally, he adds a vented panel
to the top of the controls   

226
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,587
and a metal grill to the rest of the heater.   

227
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,056
over at a test station, a technician          

228
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,559
powers up the heater using a remote-control system. 

229
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,833
he checks for gas leaks or blockages          

230
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,136
and confirms that the temperature      

231
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,773
rises in response to the remote control's commands. 

232
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,280
this patio heater has passed all of the tests  

233
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,417
and is now ready for the outside world,     

234
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,554
where people are sure to be attracted to its warm glow.  

235
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,634
narrator: in the early days of the automobile,       

236
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,770
wheels had wood spokes and rims.

237
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,438
but by the 1920s,       

238
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,041
manufacturers began using more durable materials,    

239
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,176
like iron and steel.      

240
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,114
today, wood-spoke wheels are  
used in classic-car restoration.

241
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,859
in the early 1900s, cars had wood-spoke wheels.  

242
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,328
when those antique vehicles need new wheels,        

243
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,396
collectors turn to wheelwrights.

244
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,265
they can build wood-spoke wheels

245
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,068
just as it was done a century ago.         

246
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,070
production starts with the steel rim       

247
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,005
that wraps around the wood wheel.     

248
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,143
the steel spins in a lathe as stationary tools 

249
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,944
cut it to the correct profile 

250
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,781
and create a lip for gripping the rubber tire. 

251
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,485
a worker measures the rim   

252
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,021
to confirm it's the same as the original. 

253
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,758
you can see the difference the machining has made.    

254
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,829
another member of the team measures the moisture content 

255
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,631
of hickory wood and selects boards       

256
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,768
that are sufficiently dried.  

257
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,237
he traces a rough pattern of a wheel spoke        

258
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,540
and cuts along the penciled lines.   

259
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:28,112
this gives him a basic shape to work with.         

260
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:32,183
next              
he selects a more exact pattern.

261
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,119
he clamps this pattern in a wood carving duplicator  

262
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:39,390
alongside four of the rough spokes.      

263
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,458
he follows the contours of the pattern         

264
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,061
with a tracing wheel.     

265
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:50,201
the tracing wheel moves cutting
tools that carve the hickory. 

266
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:55,006
this duplicates the profile of the wheel spoke pattern.  

267
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,742
he sands off marks left by the cutting tools      

268
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,478
and smoothes the surface of the newly formed spokes.  

269
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,482
then he secures the spokes one at a time in a jig.    

270
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,152
this steadies the spokes as he cuts the wider ends   

271
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,720
into a wedge shape.      

272
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,159
together, two wheelwrights   

273
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:18,162
arrange the spokes in a wheel formation.     

274
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,999
the wedges fit together at   
the center like pieces of a pie.

275
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,304
they tighten clamps to bring the spokes      

276
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,039
into perfect alignment.    

277
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:34,245
one of the wheelwrights inserts
a steel hub in the center hole.

278
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:37,181
he drills holes into the wood and inserts bolts

279
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,016
to secure the steel hub.    

280
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,456
using a tool that's like a big pencil sharpener,  

281
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,926
he carves the ends of the spokes, creating dowels.

282
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,998
dowels are peg-like fasteners. 

283
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,402
he sands the dowels on an angle

284
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,338
to create a gentle slope in each one.          

285
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,941
these slopes make it easier to slide the spokes   

286
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:10,548
into the two-part wood rim.  

287
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,951
using a special tool, the team stretches the rim   

288
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,155
and pulls the spokes into position.         

289
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,556
then they insert the doweled ends of the spokes 

290
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,225
into the holes.        

291
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,293
this process is difficult.   

292
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,362
one wrong move,        

293
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,365
and they could damage the spokes
or rim.            

294
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,034
but thanks to their skill,   

295
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,502
the wood-spoke wheel comes together.        

296
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,171
all of the parts are intact,  

297
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,843
and the spokes are firmly secured in the rim. 

298
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,979
a wheelwright measures the circumference of the wood rim 

299
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,216
and calculates how much will need to be trimmed off.  

300
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,188
he shaves down the wheel, adjusting the circumference  

301
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,058
to the desired dimension.   

302
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,329
the wheel must be slightly   
larger than the outer steel rim.

303
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,532
you'll see why next.      

304
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,202
they place the steel rim over an intense gas flame      

305
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,371
and cover it with a piece of metal.     

306
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:13,544
the heat causes the steel rim to expand.           

307
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,145
after about 15 minutes,    

308
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,681
the wheelwright removes the cover.       

309
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,883
he grips the hot rim with tongs

310
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,486
and transfers it to the wood wheel.       

311
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:23,954
the enlarged steel rim     

312
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,626
fits loosely around the outside
of the wooden wheel.      

313
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,429
they now spray the steel with cold water.        

314
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,565
as the rim cools, it shrinks to the hickory wood,

315
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,302
creating a permanent bond.   

316
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,638
the wheelwright shaves the spokes down     

317
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
to make them look more streamlined.       

318
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,279
he sands the wood to enhance the grain.     

319
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:56,987
it took 16 hours to make this wood-spoke wheel. 

320
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,491
it's brand-new, but looks like a thing of the past.   

321
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,273
