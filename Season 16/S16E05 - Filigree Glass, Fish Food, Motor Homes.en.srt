49
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,266
then marver until the colored

they encase the color in clear  

50
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,401
glass symmetrically encases it. 
they encase the color in clear  
crystal and reheat some more,   

51
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,470
they encase the color in clear  
crystal and reheat some more,   
then prepare a new bit of clear 

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,205
crystal and reheat some more,   
then prepare a new bit of clear 
crystal on another punty.       

53
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,407
then prepare a new bit of clear 
crystal on another punty.       
they use it to grab the free end

54
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,543
crystal on another punty.       
they use it to grab the free end

the glassmakers pull, stretching

56
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,714

the glassmakers pull, stretching

00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,561
it takes tremendous expertise to
stretch the rapidly cooling     
glass to a consistent diameter  

64
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,363
stretch the rapidly cooling     
glass to a consistent diameter  
without twisting or breaking it 

65
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,432

00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,434
without twisting or breaking it 
in the process.                 
they snip the long cane into    

67
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:53,773
in the process.                 
they snip the long cane into    
manageable lengths.             

68
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,507
they snip the long cane into    
manageable lengths.             
next, they cut the colored rods 

69
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,577
manageable lengths.             
next, they cut the colored rods 
into the size required...

00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,312
next, they cut the colored rods 
into the size required...       
lay out the rods in a precise

00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,448
into the size required...       
lay out the rods in a precise   
configuration, heat, then roll  

72
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,483
lay out the rods in a precise   
configuration, heat, then roll  
them onto a precisely sized     

73
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,052

them onto a precisely sized     
piece of molten clear crystal.  

74
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,854
them onto a precisely sized     
piece of molten clear crystal.  
now they repeat the pulling     

75
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,756
piece of molten clear crystal.  
now they repeat the pulling     
process, but this time, to

00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,324
now they repeat the pulling     
process, but this time, to      
create the internal pattern they

77
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,061
process, but this time, to      
create the internal pattern they
want, they twist both punties.  

78
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,230
create the internal pattern they
want, they twist both punties.  
they use an electric drill to   

79
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:19,799
want, they twist both punties.  
they use an electric drill to

00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,415
filigree glass piece.           
the colors and pattern inside a

the colors and pattern inside a 
complex cane are determined by  
the choice and layout of the

00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,322
before installing the frame,    
they attach three pairs of      
sliding hydraulic cylinders     

308
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,790
they attach three pairs of      
sliding hydraulic cylinders     
called rams.                    

309
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,392
sliding hydraulic cylinders     
called rams.                    
each pair operates a slideout   

310
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,996
called rams.                    
each pair operates a slideout   
room at the push of a button.   

311
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,864
each pair operates a slideout   
room at the push of a button.   
after bolting the frame to the  

312
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,733

after bolting the frame to the  
chassis, they spray each welded 

313
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,835
after bolting the frame to the  
chassis, they spray each welded 
joint with an anti-rust coating.

314
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:26,578
then, they test the rams to make
sure they slide in and out      
properly.                       

315
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,256
they lower the preassembled

workers connect the headlights  

321
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,234
and headlights built in.        
workers connect the headlights  
to the electrical system, then  

322
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,837
workers connect the headlights  
to the electrical system, then  
attach the front end to the cab

324
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,775
attach the front end to the cab 
structure.                      
then, they install the hood and

then, they install the hood and 
make any necessary adjustments. 

326
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,812
then, they install the hood and 
make any necessary adjustments. 
next, they load up the

00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,380
make any necessary adjustments. 
next, they load up the          
compartments in the basement    

328
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,849
next, they load up the

gray to differentiate it from   
the water tank.                 
now they run a line of          

341
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,743
the water tank.                 
now they run a line of          
heavy-duty adhesive along the

absorb road vibration.          
after securing the glued floor  
with screws, they staple carpet 

353
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,036
after securing the glued floor  
with screws, they staple carpet 
underpadding onto the plywood...

00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,197
all angles, including

rooms both extended and         

506
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,297
underneath -- with the slideout 
rooms both extended and         
retracted.                      

507
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,666
rooms both extended and         
retracted.                      
inspectors check everywhere,    

508
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,135
retracted.                      
inspectors check everywhere,    
even inside cabinets.           

509
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,003
inspectors check everywhere,    
even inside cabinets.           
if they find any leaks, they    

510
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,072
even inside cabinets.           
if they find any leaks, they    
seal them and run the water test

511
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:13,911
if they find any leaks, they    
seal them and run the water test
again.                          

512
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,013
seal them and run the water test
again.                          
and finally, one last mechanical

513
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,915
again.                          
and finally, one last mechanical
verification of the slideout    

514
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,484
and finally, one last mechanical
verification of the slideout    
rooms, now that they bear the   

515
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,885
verification of the slideout    
rooms, now that they bear the   
additional weight of the        

516
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,787
rooms, now that they bear the   
additional weight of the        
furnishings.                    

517
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,822
this expansion feature is the   

518
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,424
secret to the motor home's      

519
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,293
spacious feel, as it increases  

520
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,028
the floor-space width by nearly 

521
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:36,701
five feet.                      

522
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:39,270
the slideouts operate only while

523
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,272
the motor home is parked.       

524
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,307
with smart design and ingenious 

525
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,276
use of limited space, a motor   

526
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,977
home lets you hit the road      

527
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,246
without leaving the comforts of 

528
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,648
home behind.                    

529
