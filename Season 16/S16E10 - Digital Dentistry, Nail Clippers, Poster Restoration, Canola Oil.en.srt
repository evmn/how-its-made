for the patient, it means one   
appointment instead of two and

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,016
the oil is now fully refined and
ready for bottling.             
the equipment first turns the   

501
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,252
ready for bottling.             
the equipment first turns the   
plastic bottles upside down and 

502
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,654
the equipment first turns the   
plastic bottles upside down and 
injects filtered pressurized air

503
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,556
plastic bottles upside down and 
injects filtered pressurized air
to blow out any dust or dirt    

504
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,357
injects filtered pressurized air
to blow out any dust or dirt    
inside.                         

505
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,660
to blow out any dust or dirt    
inside.                         
then it turns the bottles right 

506
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,862
inside.                         
then it turns the bottles right 
side up again to position for   

507
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,663
then it turns the bottles right 
side up again to position for   
filling.                        

508
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,665
side up again to position for   
filling.                        
just before a nozzle starts     

509
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,967
filling.                        
just before a nozzle starts     
filling, it applies a vacuum.   

510
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,135
just before a nozzle starts     
filling, it applies a vacuum.   
if there's no suction,          

511
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,803
filling, it applies a vacuum.   
if there's no suction,          
indicating a leak in the bottle,

512
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,472
if there's no suction,          
indicating a leak in the bottle,
the machine automatically ejects

513
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:12,810
indicating a leak in the bottle,
the machine automatically ejects
that bottle from the line.      

514
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,812
the machine automatically ejects
that bottle from the line.      
each bottling machine in the

each bottling machine in the    
factory fills 22,000 bottles per

516
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:17,615
each bottling machine in the    
factory fills 22,000 bottles per
hour.                           

517
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,083
factory fills 22,000 bottles per
hour.                           
the labeling machines work

00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,585
hour.                           
the labeling machines work      
at the same speed.              

519
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,720
they spread glue on the back of 

520
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,289
each label, then apply the      

521
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,023
label's edge to the bottle.     

522
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,825
the bottle spins, wrapping the  

523
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,762
rest of the label around itself.

524
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,498
as the bottles come off the     

525
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,666
labeler, a robot separates them 

526
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:36,967
into groups of 12.              

527
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,903
then it picks up and deposits   

528
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,774
each dozen in a shipping box -- 

529
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,042
from field to factory to your   

530
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,178
pantry, where, once opened,     

531
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,413
canola oil has a shelf life of  

532
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,249
about a year.
