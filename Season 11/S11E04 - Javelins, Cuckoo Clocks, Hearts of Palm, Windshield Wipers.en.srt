00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,919
narrator: the sport of javelin throw   

4
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,388
dates back to the olympics in ancient greece.       

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,457
the athlete sprints down a runway         

6
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,260
and just before reaching a line on the ground,     

7
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:02,861
hurls the javelin forward.   

8
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,329
for the throw to count,    

9
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,732
the athlete can't step over the line    

10
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,202
and the javelin has to land point-first in the ground.   

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:19,077
this modern javelin consists of 
a long, hollow tube and a point.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,880
the tube portion is called the shaft.      

13
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,950
this company uses strong, lightweight aluminum,     

14
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:29,154
but javelin shafts can also be made of steel or carbon fiber. 

15
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,824
the tube is 1.2 inches in diameter.   

16
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,892
it first goes into a taper machine,        

17
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,962
where forming dies narrow the back end      

18
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,898
to very specific dimensions.  

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,300
the taper profile varies by model        

20
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,237
but has to conform to international rules.    

21
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,973
after making the exact end of the taper,         

22
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,442
they slice off the excess tubing.       

23
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,310
the shaft is now its final length --      

24
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,780
7.2 feet for a woman's model  

25
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,382
and 8.5 feet for a men's.   

26
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,586
a straightening machine sandwiches the shaft      

27
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,189
between two hydraulic cylinders.

28
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,060
they apply extreme pressure, straightening any large bends. 

29
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,662
this is just a preliminary straightening.  

30
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,065
the final one comes later.   

31
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,400
next, working strictly by eye, 

32
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:19,137
a specially trained technician sands the shaft,        

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,675
fine-tuning it to a very precise
diameter and weight.      

34
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,012
the javelin's point section is made of steel tubing    

35
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,414
that's a hair wider than the shaft.        

36
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,283
after tapering the front, they saw off the excess,    

37
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,488
making the point around 12 inches long.     

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,024
now for the point's steel tip that jabs into the ground.   

39
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,029
they position it in a holder, place the point body behind it,

40
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,498
then weld the two parts together.           

41
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,973
to make the point more aerodynamic,       

42
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,575
they sand down the weld line  

43
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,978
until it's flush with the surrounding steel.  

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,981
using progressively finer grits
of sandpaper,         

45
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,317
they polish away any imperfections       

46
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,453
until the point is perfectly smooth.      

47
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,789
now for the final assembly.  

48
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,325
the shaft is sporting two coats of paint,      

49
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,361
and the point is nickel-plated to rustproof the steel.    

50
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,733
they mark how far up the shaft the point will go       

51
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,803
and slip it on temporarily.  

52
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,138
as the javelin pivots     

53
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,807
precisely where international rules dictate,  

54
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,544
they add pieces of lead until the javelin balances.  

55
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,347
then all the components go on a scale         

56
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,550
to ensure their combined weight 
abides by international rules --

57
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,486
1.3 pounds for a women's javelin,     

58
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,422
1.8 pounds for a men's.    

59
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,891
next they squirt a little glue inside the point        

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,527
and drop the chunk of lead inside.            

61
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:55,700
they drop in some knotted cord and ram it in with a metal rod.

62
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,171
this packs in the lead so it won't rattle around.   

63
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,447
they use glue to adhere the point to the shaft.    

64
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,051
they drive home the point, so to speak,          

65
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,987
by throwing the javelin against a lead slab.      

66
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,758
the force of impact pushes the point into its final position. 

67
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,595
now they recheck the javelin's overall weight.        

68
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,996
if it's underweight,      

69
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,533
they simply tape some sheet lead
to the center of gravity,   

70
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,003
where the handgrip will hide it.

71
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,415
using a gauge to measure the grip's permissible length, 

72
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,817
they mark the grip position at the center of gravity,   

73
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,019
then mount the javelin on a lathe           

74
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,355
and coat the marked area in glue.            

75
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,265
they wind cotton cord around the shaft over the glue.

76
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,770
before cutting the end,    

77
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,240
they verify the length of the grip with the gauge.  

78
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,175
they apply two decals --    

79
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,780
one bearing the company name, the other a safety warning.  

80
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,716
but no seal of approval just yet.           

81
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,652
the javelin still has to undergo
a final straightening.     

82
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,054
this takes an expert eye    

83
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:27,192
and a small hand-operated press
to straighten out any bends.  

84
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,264
it's all a question of aerodynamics.        

85
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,732
the straighter the javelin,  

86
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,802
the more likely it is to go the distance.      

87
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,283
narrator: the black forest region of southwest germany  

88
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,086
is world-famous for its cuckoo clocks,     

89
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:57,155
which have either one-day or eight-day movements,    

90
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,624
meaning that's how long they run
on one winding.        

91
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,692
the standard feature is a little bird        

92
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,162
that emerges and cuckoos when the clock strikes.     

93
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,666
some clocks also play music and have moving figures.    

94
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,036
[ clock cuckoos ]       

95
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,842
the intricate carvings that decorate many cuckoo clocks  

96
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,576
start out as a block of linden,

97
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,645
a soft wood that's easy to carve.     

98
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,581
an artisan first outlines the basic shape        

99
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,317
using a stencil and paint,   

100
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,985
then cuts it out with a jigsaw.

101
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,722
here he's cutting three blocks at once.            

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,659
to steady the piece,      

103
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,329
he mallets it to nails     
protruding from a block of wood.

104
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,931
then he begins carving,    

105
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,666
using up to 50 different knives

106
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,136
to sculpt exceptionally fine detail.   

107
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,140
the clock cases these carvings decorate    

108
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,145
are made of pine or plywood, depending on the model.    

109
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,817
often a case has no carving at all.     

110
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,287
instead, an artist paints an elaborate design.      

111
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,527
some cases feature a combination
of painting and carving.    

112
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,031
the technical artistry is on the inside.       

113
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,233
the clock's brain, called the movement,      

114
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,303
is a system of brass and steel gears.   

115
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,239
it keeps time and triggers the cuckoo function.      

116
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,508
the components and configuration vary     

117
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,878
according to whether it's   
a one-day or eight-day movement.

118
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,651
workers sandwich the movement between two brass plates,   

119
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,921
connecting them at the corners with long screws.       

120
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,390
then on the outside,      

121
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,626
the install the mechanism that times the chime.     

122
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,468
next the steel wire on which the cuckoo bird will perch.   

123
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,470
then last but not least,    

124
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,739
the reels that will move the clock hands.        

125
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,141
the factory runs every finished movement    

126
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,645
for two days straight to ensure
it functions perfectly.    

127
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:06,084
the first part that goes on the clock case is the dial. 

128
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,286
they tack it with tiny nails. 

129
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,955
next, the wooden cuckoo bird. 

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,692
they insert the movement's perch
wire through a hole in its foot,

131
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,829
then secure it with a screw so he doesn't fly off.     

132
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,365
after trimming his tail so he'll fit,         

133
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:24,435
they screw the movement, bird and all, inside the case. 

134
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,306
next, the steel wires that operate the components  

135
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,509
that produce the cuckoo sound. 

136
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,378
we'll see them shortly.    

137
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,381
and, finally, the dial's wooden hands.    

138
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,119
every cuckoo clock has two chains         

139
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,523
that regulate the speed at which
the movement gears turn.    

140
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,325
as we see here in slow motion, 

141
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,795
an automated machine makes these
chains one link at a time   

142
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,899
by first cutting, then bending pieces of brass wire.     

143
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,072
each chain goes into the case through a hole in the bottom, 

144
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,741
then onto a wheel in the movement,        

145
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,278
then back out through another hole in the bottom of the case.

146
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,284
"s" hooks go onto the ends.  

147
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,821
these will hold cast-iron weights that pull the chain.  

148
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,823
workers rig up a small wire  

149
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,625
connecting the bird and the door.         

150
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,762

as this demonstration shows,  

153
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,974
the bird's cuckoo is actually the sound     

154
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:40,312
of air pumping in and out of two miniature bellows.   

155
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,047
before each cuckoo,      

156
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:46,184
the hammer on the end of this steel wire hits a tiny gong.  

157
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:50,255
the number of gong cuckoos indicates the hour.

after connecting the bellows to the movement,        

159

there's just one step left -- 

160
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,729
running a wire from the movement
through the bottom       

161
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,197
for the pendulum.       

162
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,000
the technical choreography can now begin.         

163
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,669
winding up the clock raises the chain,       

164
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,337
pulling up the weight on the end.          

165
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,673
as the weight falls back down gradually,           

166
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,276
it pulls the chain, which turns the movement,   

167
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,478
which drives the hands of the clock.

only after a two-day test run 

171
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,954
during which it must perform impeccably.          

172
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,559
it's this attention to detail, both artistic and technical,  

173
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,761
that makes these traditional german cuckoo clocks

narrator: heart of palm is a vegetable         

177
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,115
that comes from certain species
of palms.           

178
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,516
it doesn't grow on the plant  

179
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,519
the way fruits and vegetables usually do.          

180
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,255
rather, it's the soft, edible inner core of the stems.    

181
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,422
harvesting palm stems     

182
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,992
and then processing them to extract the heart      

183
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,427
is very labor-intensive,    

184
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,630
which is why this delicious vegetable is a delicacy.    

185
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,471
life for this tropical vegetable
begins in the farm's nursery, 

186
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,474
where they plant a palm seed in a pot of soil.       

187
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,476
after a couple of weeks,    

188
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,946
they transplant the seedling into a bag,          

189
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,182
and the seedling grows.    

190
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,626
life in the nursery is one of routine --      

191
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,962
scheduled feedings of fertilizer,         

192
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,331
regular weeding, and a daily shower.      

193
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,970
after about three months,   

194
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,907
that little seedling has matured into a plant    

195
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,442
that's strong enough to go into the field.     

196
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,112
workers remove it from the bag gently,      

197
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,980
careful not to harm the roots. 

198
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,283
then they plant it in loose soil.         

199
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,391
after about a year and a half of field growth,        

200
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,126
it's time for the first harvest.

201
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,460
using a machete,        

202
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,597
the harvester grabs and chops off the main stem.       

203
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,331
one of the remaining smaller stems         

204
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,066
will become the new main stem 

205
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,470
and be ready for harvesting in about six months' time.   

206
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,072
this cycle continues for about a decade.       

207
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,010
after cutting off the stem, the harvester strips the bark. 

208
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,812
this exposes a shell underneath

209
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:31,015
that protects the palm heart at the core of the stem    

210
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,817
from damage and dehydration.  

211
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:36,287
later the factory will slice off
this shell like so       

212
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,356
to extract the heart.     

213
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,966
once the stems arrive at the factory,        

214
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,568
they go into a basin of water immediately.          

215
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,037
this prevents dehydration.   

216
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,040
next workers load them on a conveyor belt,      

217
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,176
lining the bases right up against the edge.   

218
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,711
someone else, meanwhile,    

219
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,516
clicks a counter to tally the number of stems passing by.

220
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,851
the conveyor belt transports the stems      

221
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:11,055
to a circular saw that slices off a portion of the base.   

222
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,628
next workers slide each stem across a razor-sharp blade,   

223
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,732
slicing open the shell that encases the heart.    

224
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,805
with a quick twist, the shell comes off,      

225
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,741
and they place the heart on a conveyor above.      

226
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,277
further down the line,     

227
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,879
the hearts run against another circular saw,      

228
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,217
which slices off what's left of the base.    

229
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:43,020
next a row of saws spaced six inches apart    

230
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,022
cuts each stem into pieces.  

231
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,793
now the hearts of palm are just
the right size for packaging. 

232
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,366
in the field, the stems' bark and outer shell        

233
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,034
acted as a dirt barrier.    

234
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,037
still, the hearts get a rinse in cold water         

235
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,673
before going into the jar.   

236
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,111
each jar has to contain    

237
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,981
a specific weight and number of pieces,     

238
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,650
so it goes on a scale, and, if necessary,       

239
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,985
a worker adjusts the weight  

240
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,188
by swapping a piece for one of a different size.  

241
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,065
the jars now move onto a machine
that fills them with brine,  

242
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,068
a special recipe of water, salt, and citric acid

243
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,270
that acts as a preservative.  

244
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,541
the brine-filled jars then go into a hot-steam machine.  

245
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,210
it heats the liquid for about 10 minutes,     

246
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,811
almost to the boiling point.  

247
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,547
this forces all the air out of the hearts,       

248
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,950
preparing them for pasteurization.      

249
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,354
on the way to the pasteurization chamber, 

250
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,890
the jars pass through a capping machine,       

251
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,493
then under an ink-jet printer head,    

252
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,796
which applies the lot number and product expiration date.  

253
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:04,568
now it's into the pasteurization
chamber for an hour and a half. 

254
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,838
this intense heat, 207 degrees fahrenheit,    

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,909
kills off any microorganisms lurking inside the jars.    

256
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,978
after a one-week quarantine period       

257
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,047
to ensure the hearts of palm don't deteriorate in any way, 

258
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,451
the jars are ready for labeling.

259
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,720
the brine and pasteurization combined            

260
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,256
give the sealed container a four-year shelf life,    

261
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:31,262
so whether served alone, in a salad, with pasta or rice,

262
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,464
these hearts of palm are guaranteed         

263
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,267
to be as fresh as they are tasty.

narrator: the first windshield wipers  
were invented in the early 1900s

265
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,750
by a woman who got the idea from watching a trolley driver 

266
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,686
wipe the sleet off the windshield with his hands.   

267
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,957
after 1920, wipers became standard equipment on all cars.

268
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,527
today, even the space shuttle has them.           

269
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,902
these windshield wipers all have a rubber wiping blade.

270
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,304
to make it, workers load natural rubber  

271
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,374
into a mixer that breaks it down
into fine grains.       

272
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:22,113
then they add powdered carbon to
the rubber and leave it to mix. 

273
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,120
after several hours,      

274
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,989
a worker cuts the rubber away from the mixer      

275
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,526
and feeds it into a heat-treating machine.    

276
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,864
next the natural-rubber strips enter an extrusion machine,  

277
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,134
which will combine them with the strips of synthetic rubber.

278
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,736
the rubber extrudes through this steel die     

279
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,972
to form a continuous profiled band.         

280
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,420
the rubber band cools in a salt bath         

281
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,558
before it's cut into lengths, then split in half       

282
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,030
to form two wiping blades with a clean, sharp edge.   

283
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,703
the blades go through a spray of graphite to reduce friction,

284
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,205
then drop onto a grate to dry out.          

285
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,578
the rubber is so smooth, it's hard to grasp,      

286
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,848
so workers must insert each blade by hand       

287
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,518
into an assembling machine.  

288
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,454
in the center of the wiper blade
is an opening         

289
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:40,525
into which a machine will insert
a metal tension strip.     

290
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,461
it serves to press the blade on the windshield       

291
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,396
and hold its shape.      

292
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,265
the machine applies pneumatic pressure       

293
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,800
to literally blow the strips  

294
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,968
through the length of the blades.         

295
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,478
this steel coil feeds into a stamping machine 

296
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,615
that repeatedly cuts and bends it to form brackets. 

297
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,950
these brackets         

298
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,486
connect the windshield-wiper blades to the wiper arm    

299
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,221
and give them the shape they need           

300
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,290
to wipe on curved windshields. 

301
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,161
the brackets come out of the machine in rows,    

302
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,864
still attached to the edges of the coil.   

303
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,504
next, the rows of brackets dip into a vat of paint    

304
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,772
to receive a base coat,    

305
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,109
followed by two more coats of black paint         

306
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,245
that will protect them from corrosion for several years.  

307
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,988
assemble all these pieces together,           

308
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,725
and you'll have this complete windshield wiper.

309
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,895
thanks to this machine, it's a fully automated process.

310
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:58,936
first it sets a plastic joint on the smallest brackets,   

311
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:03,274
then clips them two at a time onto a larger middle bracket. 

312
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,287
next the machine sets an adaptor
onto the top-center bracket  

313
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,757
so the wiper can attach to a variety of car wiper arms.

314
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,828
finally, all the trays     

315
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,897
on which lie the assembled wiper parts come together    

316
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,167
as the machine proceeds with the final assembly.    

317
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,837
four brackets held by joints  

318
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,373
branch out from the main center bracket. 

319
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,508
they hold the wiper blade in eight different places.   

320
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,979
this design allows a full range
of movement to the wiper    

321
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,449
while applying an even pressure
all along the blade --     

322
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,085
the key to a clean wipe with no streaking.       

323
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:56,561
the completed wipers come off the assembler two at a time.  

324
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,535
workers visually inspect the wipers           

325
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,004
and then test the performance of the blade          

326
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,139
against a rotating sheet of wet glass.         

327
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,409
they monitor the amount of friction     

328
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,011
the blade applies to the glass 

329
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,547
and gauge its durability.   

330
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,490
finally, they test the wipers on an opaque black windshield 

331
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,060
that reveals just how well they work.           

332
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,832
with a life-span of more than a million wipes, 

333
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,536
they're surely the most reliable
device on any car.       

334
