00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,090
         narrator: today        
      on "how it's made"...     

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,260
       alkaline batteries.      

5
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,699
          wheelchairs.          

6
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,837
             flutes.            

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,910
        and cowboy boots.       

8
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,187
       a battery produces       
       an electric current      

9
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,456
     when its positive end,     
       called the cathode,      

10
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,991
      and its negative end,     
    called the anode, connect   

11
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,863
    via a conductive pathway    
 in the battery-operated device.

12
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,466
          this pathway          
      conducts electricity      

13
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,800
    when three components --    

14
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,870
         two electrodes         
 and an electrolyte -- interact.

15
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,542
    these alkaline batteries    
   are the rechargeable type.   

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,013
      they last for years,      
 depending on how you use them. 

17
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,881
  the factory begins production 

18
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,884
 by cutting nickel-plated steel 
        into oval pieces,       

19
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,954
     then gradually shaping     
     each piece into a tube,    

20
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,156
        called a console.       

21
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,691
       the console houses       

22
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,693
         some important         
     chemical ingredients --    

23
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,896
            graphite,           
  which conducts electricity... 

24
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:42,100
 silver catalyst, which reduces 
  chemical-pressure buildup...  

25
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,102
       manganese dioxide,       

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,971
       the main ingredient      
        in the cathode...       

27
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,506
         barium sulfate,        

28
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,109
           which binds          
    the cathode ingredients,    

29
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,978
    zinc, the main ingredient   
          in the anode,         

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,115
     a gelling agent to keep    
  the zinc particles suspended, 

31
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,918
          and finally,          
      potassium hydroxide,      

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,456
 which interacts with electrodes
     to produce electricity.    

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,526
    this 25-head press shapes   
the cathode's powdered chemicals

34
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,995
      into hollow pellets.      

35
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:14,199
      the press churns out      
     25,000 pellets an hour.    

36
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,338
a machine called a console press

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,407
   then inserts three pellets   
      into each console --      

38
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,010
   three because these pellets  
         are so fragile         

39
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,880
    that three smaller ones     
    are easier to manipulate    

40
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,581
  than one big pellet would be. 

41
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,420
      here's the insertion      
         in slow motion.        

42
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,634
 the next machine makes a ridge 
    on one end of the console   

43
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,270
        to help seal it.        

44
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,846
 plastic holders, called pucks, 
     hold the consoles still    

45
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,382
   as nozzles apply a sealant   
           to the top,          

46
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,618
    which is the negative end   
         of the console.        

47
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,526
 next, they cut a roll of paper 
       into small strips.       

48
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,928
          these strips          
     are called separators.     

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,666
   they have microscopic holes  
  that permit the flow of ions, 

50
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,934
      electrically-charged      
           molecules,           

51
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,304
       between the cathode      
         and the anode.         

52
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,809
a hot-melt glue machine deposits
     a small amount of glue     

53
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,944
 into the separator, now rolled,

54
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,248
   and seals the positive end   
       of the paper tube.       

55
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,086
   the glue cools and hardens   
over the next minute and a half,

56
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:45,157
   as the consoles move along   
           a conveyor.          

57
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,092
        the next machine        
    injects an electrolyte --   

58
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,162
 a potassium hydroxide solution.

59
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,964
  it takes nine minutes to soak 
   through the separator liner  

60
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,700
    into the cathode pellets.   

61
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,774
       nozzles then inject      
  about .15 ounces of zinc gel  

62
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,376
     into the anode cavity.     

63
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,713
only about 2/3 of the gel weight
        is actually zinc.       

64
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,783
 the other 1/3 is this company's
  closely guarded trade secret. 

65
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,320
 it's what makes these batteries
          rechargeable.         

66
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,957
     the zinc gives the gel     
     its silver-gray color.     

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,732
        a welding machine       
     fuses 1 1/2-inch nails     

68
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,867
  onto the cap of the battery.  

69
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,804
    this is where the current   
collects before it's discharged.

70
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,481
   the machine ejects the cap   
         when finished,         

71
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,815
 and another machine inserts it 

72
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,684
      into the negative end     
         of the battery.        

73
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,486
        this cap includes       
        a safety feature        

74
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,688
           crucial to           
    rechargeable batteries --   

75
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,090
  it can resist high pressure.  

76
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,826
   but if heat or power surges  
    cause excessive pressure,   

77
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,829
a tiny vent prevents the battery
         from exploding.        

78
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,232
     the machine folds over     
         the console lip        

79
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,301
    to enclose the contents.    

80
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,570
           a rotating,          
   three-head crimping machine  

81
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,905
       then makes a ridge       
     in the finished battery    

82
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,709
to reduce the chance of leakage.

83
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,384
  an electrical testing machine 

84
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,720
      contacts each battery     
      for 200 milliseconds      

85
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,724
        to ensure it has        
       at least 1.5 volts.      

86
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,927
  these batteries will be ready 
       to use right away.       

87
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,263
  no need to charge them first. 

88
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,199
      the labeling machine      
       uses light sensors       

89
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,535
      to time the labeling      
     of each battery casing.    

90
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,405
        the plastic label       
   lists technical information  

91
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,008
 and adds additional insulation.

92
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,278
  then three seconds in an oven 
    at 388 degrees fahrenheit   

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,515
       shrinks the labels       
         to a tight fit.        

94
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,158
            narrator:           
     spain's king phillip ii    

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,828
  was the first disabled person 
    to get around on wheels.    

96
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,899
  he ruled from a rolling chair 
  with foot rests in the 1500s. 

97
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,769
       today's wheelchairs      
      are widely available,     

98
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,439
 but at a price of a few hundred
  to several thousand dollars,  

99
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,941
   depending on the features.   

100
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,114
       this wood, leather,      
         and steel chair        

101
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,049
   is a world war ii antique.   

102
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,787
  a modern wheelchair literally 
     runs circles around it.    

103
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,790
       with more than 150       
    possible design options,    

104
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:36,794
today's wheelchair fits the user
    and the user's lifestyle.   

105
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,398
   the wheel rim is aluminum.   
      the spokes -- steel.      

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,001
    it's much like a bicycle,   
       except for these --      

107
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,535
       six steel brackets       

108
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,773
        that later fasten       
  to a hand rim for propulsion. 

109
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,545
   tires are either pneumatic,  
   with an inner-tube of air,   

110
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,482
           or rigid --          
 just one solid piece of rubber.

111
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:01,286
  a machine stretches the tire  
      to fit the wheel rim.     

112
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:05,623
   workers install 12 washers,  
         called spacers,        

113
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,292
       along the hand-rim.      

114
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,862
  six of these 1/2-inch spacers 
      can be removed later      

115
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:15,366
      to adjust the chair's     
  overall width, if necessary.  

116
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,701
   the spacers on the hand-rim  

117
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,770
     align with the brackets    
          on the wheel.         

118
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,105
        workers join them       
    with industrial-strength,   

119
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,374
    1 1/2-inch steel screws.    

120
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,245
        replacing a wheel       
     and hand-rim like this     

121
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,380
      costs more than $100.     

122
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,384
    you buy replacement parts   
  much like you do car parts -- 

123
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,687
through specialized dealerships.

124
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,929
    bearings make the wheels    
         roll with ease.        

125
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,665
         installing them        
    is a delicate operation.    

126
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,202
           workers use          
     special custom tooling     

127
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,572
     to insert the bearings     
     with extreme precision.    

128
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,087
       the tires are rigid      
       and have no treads       

129
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,557
    because they're designed    
   for smooth indoor surfaces.  

130
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,961
 an aluminum cross-frame is what
   enables the chair to fold.   

131
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,031
    they assemble it with six   
    or seven screws per side,   

132
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,901
  depending on the depth needed 
          for the seat,         

133
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,438
 which they'll install later on.

134
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,108
the front part of the wheelchair
   is called the front frame.   

135
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,978
   workers lubricate the parts  
so they'll be easier to install.

136
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,249
this also enables the wheelchair
       to fold with ease.       

137
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,053
   they install the rear frame  
        of the wheelchair       

138
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,023
         then make sure         
the cross-frame folds correctly.

139
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,394
          workers test          
   the height-adjustment lever  

140
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,796
        for the armrest.        

141
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,932
        then they install       
 a removable aluminum footrest, 

142
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,268
           setting it           
     to the desired length.     

143
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,537
       it has a heel loop       

144
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,339
   to prevent the user's foot   
       from slipping off.       

145
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,875
          the chair has         
     a foldable sling seat.     

146
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,543
       it's made of nylon       

147
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,648
    and attaches to the frame   
 with six screws on both sides. 

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,288
   you can adjust the armrest   
   height from 8 to 11 inches   

149
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,759
 and the tension in the backrest
      with 3 velcro straps.     

150
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,495
  the backrest is made of nylon 

151
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,964
            and comes           
   in nine different heights.   

152
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,634
         workers insert         
 the wheel axle into the frame, 

153
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,570
  adjusting it to fit with the  
 optional features of the chair,

154
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,640
   such as a particular style   
           of armrest.          

155
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,775
  the axle has a quick release  

156
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,178
   so you can remove the wheel  
           in seconds.          

157
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,382
    this plastic-and-aluminum   
 hand lever is a parking brake. 

158
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,920
  it keeps the chair still when 
transferring to a bed or toilet.

159
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,791
      this motorized chair      
  has an electrical controller. 

160
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,194
      the user commands it      
        with a joystick.        

161
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,530
         the chair runs         
    on two 12-volt batteries    

162
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,133
  that power up in eight hours  
    from a household socket.    

163
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:06,203
 workers squeeze the inner tube 
    into the rear wheel rim.    

164
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,205
   the air valve slips through  

165
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,743
  and the front and back parts  
       attach with screws.      

166
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:16,080
       now the rear wheel       
     can go onto the motor.     

167
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,283
      they attach the seat      
      and the joystick box,     

168
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,755
        which has on/off        
   and speed-control switches.  

169
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,225
        the battery-pack        
    provides 85 amps an hour.   

170
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,762
       that's enough power      
    for 16 hours or 25 miles.   

171
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,564
      the batteries connect     
  to the charger and controller 

172
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,034
   to power up the wheelchair.  

173
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,836
   a steel bumper and plastic   
   rear hood, called a shroud,  

174
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,506
       protect the back of      
the wheelchair from the elements

175
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,142
  and against minor collisions. 

176
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,847
 this motorized model can glide 
       at a leisurely pace      

177
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,285
 or zoom around at a top speed  
 of just over 7 miles per hour. 

178
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,664
            narrator:           
  the transverse flute has been 
    an orchestral instrument    

179
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,799
        since the 1700s.        

180
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,801
           you play it          
    in a horizontal position,   

181
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,004
   blowing across an oval hole  
       in the mouthpiece.       

182
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,408
    the air hits a sharp edge   
    inside, producing sound.    

183
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,343
 you turn that sound into notes 

184
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,981
 by pressing the keys that open 
  and close the flute's holes.  

185
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,819
      [ flute music plays ]     

186
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,895
      they begin production     

187
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,898
 by inserting a solid steel bar 
  into a sterling silver tube.  

188
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,701
      then, using a press,      
 they lengthen it and taper it, 

189
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,237
      reducing the diameter     
  to just under 3/4 of an inch. 

190
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,907
      this tube is part of      
   what's called a head joint,  

191
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,242
      one of three sections     
     that make up the flute.    

192
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,446
   the other sections are the   
center joint and the foot joint.

193
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,946
    next, on another machine,   

194
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,650
    they insert a second tube   
      for the center joint.     

195
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,185
 this device drills small holes 

196
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,586
      to mark the position      
       of each tone hole,       

197
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,790
      the raised rim around     
   each of the flute's holes.   

198
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,225
         now they insert        
        titanium washers,       

199
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,196
  called spiders, in the holes  
to help position the tone holes.

200
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,600
     they place a tone hole     
       around each spider,      

201
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,203
     securing it temporarily    
        with copper wire.       

202
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,773
 once they solder the tone hole,
   they'll remove the spider.   

203
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,277
    they solder little posts    
   onto three strips of metal,  

204
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,679
          called ribs.          

205
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,883
  the ribs and posts will later 
 hold the flute's keys in place.

206
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,351
   next they use what's called  
        a profile cutter        

207
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,621
     to shave the tone holes    
       by minute amounts,       

208
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,956
  to perfect the flute's sound. 

209
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,160
    now, using a wax injector   
        and rubber molds,       

210
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:46,030
   they create wax duplicates   
   of the 120 different parts   

211
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,367
          that make up          
      the flute's 20 keys.      

212
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,503
         now they build         
      what's called a tree.     

213
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,706
using tweezers and a heated pen,

214
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,342
  they fuse the wax duplicates  
         to a wax trunk         

215
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:00,978
 that's 6 1/2 to 10 inches tall,
 depending on the type of flute.

216
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,048
    then they place the tree    
   in a perforated steel flask  

217
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,917
    covered in masking tape.    

218
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,518
          they pour in          
     1/4 gallon of plaster,     

219
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
 which hardens around the tree. 

220
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,522
    then they remove the tape   
       and heat the flask.      

221
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,324
the wax melts through the holes,

222
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,327
    leaving plaster cavities    
 in the shape of the key parts. 

223
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,397
  the keys are made from tiny   
  particles of silver or gold.  

224
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,932
  these ones have a reddish hue 

225
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,134
        because of their        
      high copper content.      

226
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,404
       the craftsmen pour       
   a carefully measured amount  

227
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,606
   into the casting machine's   
         upper chamber.         

228
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,208
   the machine heats the metal  
         for 12 minutes.        

229
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,945
the plaster flask goes into the 
casting machine's lower chamber.

230
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,615
    they release molten metal   
       into the cavities.       

231
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,817
      once the metal cools,     

232
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,420
    they shatter the plaster    
        under cold water,       

233
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,889
         exposing a tree        
      of silver key parts.      

234
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,491
    using a pneumatic cutter,   

235
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,626
       craftsmen snip off       
         the key parts.         

236
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:52,096
 they have a dull finish because
 the silver isn't yet polished. 

237
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,899
         now they solder        
     the key parts together     

238
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,703
  and polish each finished key  
  with a soft rotating brush.   

239
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,772
  they also solder on a riser,  

240
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,374
         which attaches         
   the mouthpiece's lip plate   

241
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,710
     to the head joint tube.    

242
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,247
   they cut away excess metal   

243
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,517
        from the opening        
        of the lip plate.       

244
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,453
      then they use a lathe     

245
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,922
        to cut out a hole       
     in the head joint tube.    

246
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,459
a template ensures they position
       the hole correctly.      

247
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,332
           once again,          
      they use copper wire      

248
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,802
   to hold the parts together   
        until soldering.        

249
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,873
           they solder          
     the lip plate assembly     

250
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,544
     to the head joint tube,    
  using a gas-and-oxygen torch. 

251
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,280
    next, they mount the keys   

252
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,216
        using tiny wires        
    called straight springs.    

253
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,985
        the spring helps        
     open and close each key    

254
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,421
     over the corresponding     
           tone hole.           

255
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:54,158
   they test each key's seal,   
 called the pad, for air leaks. 

256
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,296
 a thin strip of plastic slides 
 out if it's improperly sealed. 

257
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:03,101
 the pad is made up of a plastic
   washer and a felt cushion,   

258
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:07,638
    surrounded by a synthetic   
wrapper as thin as tissue paper.

259
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,507
a pad lasts for about five years

260
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,244
      and is very expensive     
    to replace -- about $75.    

261
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,515
        it's just one of        
up to 100 components in a flute,

262
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,183
     depending on the model.    

263
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:23,187
   this company's flutes come   
 in silver, gold, and platinum. 

264
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:27,358
       they range in price      
     from $8,000 to $43,000.    

265
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,529
 once all the keys are in place,

266
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,732
     a quick wipe to remove     
     any pesky fingerprints.    

267
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,937
    an engraver inscribes the   
 serial number and company logo.

268
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,139
         after 120 hours        
      of painstaking work,      

269
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,609
       the flute is ready       
     for its musical debut.     

270

      [ flute music plays ]     

271
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,636
narrator: cowboy boots have been
kicking around since the 1800s. 

272
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,238
 you can wear them on the ranch 

273
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,041
   or just as a country-style   
       fashion statement.       

274
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:21,579
  most cowboy boots are made of 
cowhide and sell for about $200.

275
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,981
          for something         
      more exotic, though,      

276
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,186
    how about a pair made of    
  ostrich skin for a mere $500? 

277
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,726
production starts with a machine
       called the clicker       

278
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,261
that works like a cookie cutter,

279
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,131
         slicing leather        
   into various sizes of soles  

280
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,133
  from standard to extra wide.  

281
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,535
      the clicker also cuts     
      the other boot parts,     

282
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,138
       such as the shaft,       
  the section above the ankle.  

283
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,207
       this programmable,       
   automated stitching machine  

284
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,610
       decorates the shaft      
        with embroidery.        

285
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,480
        the machine works       
   on a dozen boots at a time,  

286
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,516
    using up to 15 different    
         thread colors.         

287
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,021
     workers steam the shaft    
    to soften up the leather.   

288
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,356
           synthetics           
   just don't mold to the foot  

289
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,892
    the way animal hides do,    

290
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,627
         so this company        
   uses only the real thing --  

291
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,963
    python skin, walrus skin,   

292
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,499
 bison skin, even ostrich skin. 

293
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,370
 cow- and pig-skin boots make up
 the bulk of production, though,

294
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,440
    because they're the most    
           affordable.          

295
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,575
  workers perforate the shaft,  

296
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,911
 then layer a different-colored 
       leather underneath       

297
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,312
       to create a design.      

298
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,782
          this company          
   produces 20 basic patterns,  

299
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,719
      but clients can also      
      order custom designs.     

300
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,788
       they line the shaft      
          with pig skin         

301
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,791
   because it breathes better   
    than a synthetic lining.    

302
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,327
     workers stitch together    
       the shaft sections,      

303
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,997
    including the underlays,    
      from the inside out.      

304
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,132
    piping covers the seams.    

305
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,537
 a roller turns the whole thing 
         right side out,        

306
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,339
      flattening the piping     
   for a more comfortable fit.  

307
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,151
        the next machine        
      glues a cotton strip      

308
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,153
     to the leather insole.     

309
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,457
they'll later attach this strip 
to the foot section of the boot.

310
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:20,364
  next, they temporarily attach 
   the sole to a plastic mold,  

311
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,366
       called a boot last.      

312
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,968
    this makes the sole rigid   

313
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,636
  while they attach other parts 
          of the boot.          

314
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,173
 they glue a hard, synthetic cup
       to the heel section      

315
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,175
  to give it the desired shape. 

316
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,978
         then they apply        
      a fibrous cotton form     

317
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,148
       between the layers       
  that will shape the toe area. 

318
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,589
         now they attach        
     the sole to the shaft.     

319
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,458
          using a laser         
      as a centering guide,     

320
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,195
  they stretch the toe section  
       over the boot last,      

321
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,232
 bringing the two largest pieces
      of the boot together.     

322
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,472
 they stitch on a leather strip 
     to attach the sections.    

323
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,207
   this strip, called a welt,   

324
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,142
      is a traditional part     
         of boot-making.        

325
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,212
    it's what makes the boot    
          very durable.         

326
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,288
    they attach a steel shank   
       for arch support...      

327
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,892
     then apply a mixture of    
  granulated cork and hot glue. 

328
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,228
           this layer           
   will make the boot conform   

329
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,030
         to the contours        
      of the wearer's foot.     

330
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,367
      they attach the sole      
          to the shaft          

331
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,301
 with industrial-strength glue. 

332
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,504
    the fact that it's glued    
       as well as stitched      

333
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,441
 means you can simply rip it out
    and replace a worn sole.    

334
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:41,779
  this feature greatly extends  
      the life of the boot.     

335
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,249
   a cutting machine trims off  
       the excess leather.      

336
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,858
    then they stitch the sole   
          to the welt.          

337
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,601
           they stitch          
   using interlacing threads.   

338
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,170
      this binds the pieces     
       even more strongly.      

339
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,677
   the final layer of the sole  
can be either leather or rubber.

340
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,147
  it all depends on who will be 
  wearing the boots and where.  

341
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,283
    a rancher in sunny texas    
       may prefer leather.      

342
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,787
    but in the cold and snow,   
 you're better off with rubber. 

343
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,759
       now for the heel...      

344
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,361
   they load a driving machine  
           with nails.          

345
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,231
       the pattern varies       
 according to the type of heel. 

346
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,835
      this company produces     
       eight heel styles.       

347
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,239
          a laser guide         
   ensures they nail the heel   

348
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,641
 to the boot perfectly centered.

349
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,647
with a brush, they coat both the
  heel and the edge of the sole 

350
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,516
    in black or mahogany dye.   

351
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,188
       finally, they brand      
     the manufacturer's name    

352
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,257
          in gold foil.         

353
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,525
   some boots have pull holes   
           at the top           

354
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,863
for getting your boots on fast, 
to make it to the rodeo on time.
