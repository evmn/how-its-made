narrator: the reclining barber chair   

4
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,123
was invented in america in 1878.

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,726
at the time, it was a grooming breakthrough.

6
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,129
with a chair that leaned back and moved forward,       

7
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,064
the barber could shave the customer    

8
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,332
with greater precision,    

9
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,667
and when wielding a straight-edged razor,    

10
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,437
precision is definitely a good thing.         

11
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,477
the barber chair is the original easy chair.  

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,813
just sit back and enjoy the recline.     

13
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,817
the client doesn't need to position himself for a shave. 

14
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,019
the chair does all the moving. 

15
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,722
it even lifts and swivels.   

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,560
production starts with the base of the chair.  

17
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:39,164
an employee places a flat, round piece of steel  

18
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,566
in a two-part die.       

19
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,968
the die comes together and applies pressure      

20
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,639
to take the steel from flat to domed.      

21
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,778
the domed chair base then spins

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,349
as an abrasive wheel etches a 
brushed finish onto the surface.

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,389
next, the worker tucks the end of a strip of steel      

24
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,657
between rollers        

25
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,327
and turns them to curl the steel into a sleeve

26
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,596
for the hydraulic chair lift. 

27
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,865
he slides a piece of plastic into grooves on the ends    

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,935
to close the steel sleeve.   

29
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:18,604
then he slides it onto the chair lift pump.   

30
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:23,608
he places a large trim ring on the end of the pump     

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,146
and sets the domed chair base on top.            

32
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:31,350
screws secure the base and chair-lift assembly.    

33
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,819
with the assembly now right-side-up,       

34
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,756
he attaches a u-shaped foot pedal to the pump.    

35
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,496
production then moves     

36
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,701
to the construction of the actual seat.      

37
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:52,704
the worker glues several sheets
of russian birch        

38
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,741
and staples them together.   

39
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,912
she continues to layer     

40
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,715
until the birch is nearly an inch thick.    

41
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,120
the last layer is thick plywood.

42
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:12,391
it's been cut to accommodate a steel frame.         

43
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,060
she glues and staples the plywood          

44
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,295
to the layered birch.     

45
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,734
then it's into a press     

46
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,804
for the chair's seat, back, and arms.        

47
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,875
it bends the parts to a gentle curvature     

48
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,945
that will make the chair more comfortable to sit in.  

49
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,414
with a hot stamp,       

50
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,350
the worker brands the company name and logo   

51
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,052
into vinyl upholstery.     

52
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:46,024
he places the wood chair back into a bed of cushy foam.   

53
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,461
he pulls the edges of the foam tightly to the wood      

54
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,629
and staples it.        

55
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:55,234
he trims the excess.      

56
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:59,305
he covers the chair back with the pre-sewn vinyl upholstery, 

57
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,307
and it's a snug fit.      

58
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,315
next, he gets a hand from a pneumatic device.    

59
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,383
it holds the chair part in place

60
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,854
as he staples the upholstery to it.     

61
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:19,592
he trims the vinyl for a clean edge.        

62
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,926
he checks the fit,       

63
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,529
and, once satisfied, he moves on to the chair arms. 

64
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,999
he locks an arm in a clamp   

65
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,468
and installs the chrome end piece.     

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,871
the chrome resists wear better than vinyl does --   

67
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,674
important on this gripping part.

68
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,878
the crew attaches the steel chair frame     

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,883
to the underside of the upholstered seat.    

70
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,786
they screw the arms onto the frame.        

71
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,223
they install the pneumatic mechanism    

72
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,626
that makes the chair recline. 

73
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,962
they screw the upholstered chair back to the steel frame 

74
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,966
and link the recliner mechanism to it. 

75
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:08,707
they test the recline and incline functions.     

76
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,576
the footrest is next.     

77
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,447
they then pump up the lift shaft

78
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,317
and transfer the upholstered chair to it.  

79
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,592
they close the back of the chair
with an upholstered panel,   

80
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:27,860
and finally,          

81
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,462
they give the customer a place to rest his head.   

82
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,931
with the headrest installed,  

83
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,035
this barber chair is ready for customers.    

84
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,006
time spent reclining in it   

85
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,543
will no doubt leave the client looking and feeling refreshed. 

86
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,366
narrator: a sewage pump is part
of an underground operation  

87
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,434
to dispose of human waste.   

88
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,969
it is essential equipment   

89
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,506
when sewage must be pumped   
to a septic system or sewer line

90
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,976
at a higher underground location.     

91
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,577
working below the surface,   

92
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,647
sewage pumps take care of unpleasant business.    

93
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,053
when it comes to sewage,    

94
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,457
people understandably prefer to flush and forget.      

95
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,727
the sewage pump helps make that possible.   

96
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,729
it is the number-one way to move waste.         

97
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,733
when the sewage reaches a certain level upon discharge,

98
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,201
the pump's floating sensor   

99
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,271
activates a switch to start pumping.        

100
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:51,610
then it's on its way to a septic system or sewer line, 

101
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:55,581
ensuring that sewage receives the necessary treatment.    

102
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,553
they make the sewage-pump housing    

103
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,221
from a rugged cast iron.    

104
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,558
a chain conveyor takes the housing parts for a rinse 

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,227
and an application of a chemical

106
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,631
that slightly etches the surface
in preparation for finishing. 

107
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,165
the journey continues     

108
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,769
through a big dryer that removes residual moisture.

109
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,173
the parts now head into the spray booth      

110
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,509
for a finish that will protect the surface. 

111
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,179
the conveyor delivers a negative charge to the parts,

112
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,382
causing the positively charged powder finish         

113
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,850
to gravitate to them.     

114
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,320
it completely coats the parts, 

115
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:39,458
and they travel through an oven
to bake on the powder finish. 

116
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,927
next, workers move the pump-housing units     

117
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,196
across to a spinning, abrasive disk.         

118
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,464
this grinds the edges flat   

119
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,669
to allow for a tight seal to other parts.        

120
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,538
here's the housing before grinding,        

121
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,541
and here it is after.     

122
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,548
he places a gauge under the part
in several places       

123
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,418
to ensure that it's completely even.   

124
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,955
next, a tool machines the part of the housing    

125
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,291
that holds the stator,     

126
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,492
the stationary part of the motor.         

127
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,362
it carves the opening so that the stator will fit to it   

128
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:22,300
and also align next to the motor housing.   

129
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,903
using a drill press,      

130
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,374
a worker cuts a thread into another part of the pump. 

131
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:31,810
this will allow it to connect to a discharge pipe.

132
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,518
the parts are now ready for assembly.         

133
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,454
a worker presses the carbon half
of a seal for the rotor shaft 

134
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,622
into place.          

135
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,394
he lubricates the rotor shaft 

136
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:54,066
and inserts it into the pump housing.     

137
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:58,269
a blast of compressed air removes any contaminants.   

138
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,207
and he installs the ceramic half
of the rotor-shaft seal.    

139
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,745
next, he screws the impeller to the rotor shaft.      

140
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,613
the impeller will move sewage 

141
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:13,819
from the pumping chamber to the discharge pipe.     

142
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,588
he installs an o-ring     
around the opening to the motor.

143
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:23,028
he inserts the stator...    

144
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,931
and screws it into place.   

145
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,237
he connects lead wires to terminals in the motor housing 

146
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,839
and sets it in place.     

147
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,709
he runs the power cord through the motor housing   

148
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,711
and tightens a seal around the cord.        

149
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,313
he attaches a metal guard   

150
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,450
to give the pump float adequate clearance,      

151
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,987
then seals the motor housing and wires the pump switch.   

152
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,257
he screws the switch case to the housing.        

153
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,192
a worker plugs in the pump   

154
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:58,130
to test for any shorts in the electrical components. 

155
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,533
the pump passes all the tests. 

156
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:09,274
it's ready for the float that actuates the pump switch. 

157
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,343
a piece has been cut out of this pump          

158
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,080
to give us an inside look at the sewage pump       

159
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,616
and its operation.       

160
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,553
as waste water rises, so does the float,       

161
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,889
and it activates the switch to turn on the pump.      

162
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,492
when the sewage subsides,   

163
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,895
the float lowers and switches off the pump.   

164
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,232
next, the pump takes the plunge
in a test tank         

165
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,568
to ensure that it can handle the pressure

166
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,204
and that it meets all the performance standards. 

167
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,108
once the computer gives    
the sewage pump the green light,

168
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,880
it's on its way to a septic system near you.  

169
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,786
built for a life of effluence, 

170
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:58,524
this sewage pump is now ready to go with the flow.      

171
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,075
narrator: there are unofficial claims  

172
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,344
that bimini boat tops were named

173
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,948
for the sun-drenched bimini islands of the bahamas. 

174
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,084
the open-sided canvas tops are usually retractable,    

175
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,820
and beginning in the early '60s,       

176
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:32,391
were developed to offer boaters
protection from the sun.    

177
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,762
out on the open water,     

178
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,365
bimini boat tops provide shelter from the rain 

179
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,100
and shade in the sun.     

180
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,635
their durable and versatile materials    

181
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:48,840
withstand rugged sea breezes and intense u.v. rays     

182
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,044
while providing ample headroom for boaters.          

183
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,513
a worker measures a piece of anodized aluminum tubing  

184
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,182
for the exact leg height needed

185
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,985
for each custom-made bimini boat top.        

186
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,254
then he cuts the tubing    

187
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:07,459
to the dimension needed for each boat.         

188
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,594
they use aluminum and stainless steel      

189
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,929
because they don't rust.    

190
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,068
the worker begins bending the frame of the boat top.   

191
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,137
the eventual roof support is on the floor        

192
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,940
while he holds the leg height in his hand.          

193
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,943
he must be careful to not overbend.        

194
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:31,883
the final angle is about 88 degrees.      

195
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,951
the worker crowns the tubing, 

196
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,021
a process that puts a rise in the center of the roof    

197
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,957
and pulls the legs inward.   

198
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,161
each bimini boat top      

199
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,363
is made of three bows of different heights.     

200
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,766
the front is shorter than the back,   

201
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,301
while the center is usually  

202
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,570
about 40% of the back leg height.    

203
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,442
workers now assemble the bows. 

204
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,111
they attach eye ends and jaw slides         

205
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,316
to form rudimentary hinges.  

206
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:07,118
they now unfold the assembled tubing      

207
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,122
using the precise measurements of a customer's boat.     

208
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:13,125
they simulate the final shape of the boat top        

209
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:16,428
by using tape to spread the bows
to exact widths.        

210
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,334
once the bows have been spread and the distance is measured,  

211
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,869
they can see the shape of the final boat top.     

212
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:29,741
all that's left is installing the roof itself. 

213
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,744
the roof is made of acrylic canvas       

214
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,546
that is both water- and fade-resistant.      

215
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,682
and there are plenty of colors to choose from.        

216
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,151
the patterning process begins. 

217
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,953
once the roof is cut,     

218
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,623
a worker stitches the roof panels.        

219
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,425
workers spread the cut panels over the bow setup       

220
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,162
to finalize the roof dimensions.

221
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,432
the canvas fabric is clamped to the bow setup  

222
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:57,369
as a worker marks the edges on the outside of the fabric. 

223
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,238
the roof is made in panels.  

224
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,440
it usually takes two or more panels       

225
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,708
to complete a roof,      

226
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,045
depending on the size of the boat.          

227
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,916
once excess material has been trimmed off,     

228
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:15,854
the worker begins stitching.  

229
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,523
she turns the outer edge of the roof          

230
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,659
and uses a straight stitch.  

231
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,594
she works on the sides of the canvas roof       

232
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,363
before the ends.        

233
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,267
the worker now patterns the listing,   

234
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,603
which is a pocket through which
the bow will be inserted.   

235
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,306
here's what the listing's raw pattern looks like     

236
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,342
once measured and cut.     

237
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:41,146
she places the finished listing
on top of the panel      

238
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:45,016
and stitches it to the end of the roof panel. 

239
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,684
the stitching process is key  

240
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,121
to the durability of the boat top.        

241
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,693
she turns the roof over so the listing is backwards.  

242
00:14:55,695 --> 00:15:00,565
it's actually sewn on inside-out
and then turned over.     

243
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:06,438
she stitches the entire length of the listing closed...    

244
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,374
then the company's identification tag.      

245
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,780
workers now insert the pieces of tubing      

246
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,516
into the listings of the canvas roof.      

247
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:24,122
first, they push the rear bow all the way through.      

248
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,123
once the rear bow is in place, 

249
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,127
they prepare to insert the center and front bow    

250
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,262
of the boat top.        

251
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,333
they unfurl the remainder of the roof   

252
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:40,872
and position the center bow on the center listing.     

253
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,808
gradually, they slide the tubing

254
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,910
all the way through the center listing.      

255
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,950
with the front bow inserted,  

256
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,086
the bimini boat top is almost complete.      

257
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,026
an employee inspects the boat top for any defects. 

258
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,562
once installed, the bimini boat top      

259
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,763
can either be tucked away in its boot          

260
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,500
or opened up and held in place by front straps.        

261
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:09,834
for the life of your boat,   

262
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:13,371
a well-maintained bimini boat top has it covered.

263
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,987
narrator: running an engine on diesel fuel is efficient,  

264
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,656
but it emits smelly, black exhaust,            

265
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,324
soot, leftover carbon     

266
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,328
that didn't burn off in the combustion process.   

267
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,197
to prevent exhaust emissions from polluting the air,    

268
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,733
diesel engines and diesel-powered generators 

269
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,768
need powerful filters.     

270
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,407
this self-cleaning diesel filter
traps engine-exhaust soot   

271
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,810
and burns it off by heating the filter elements.

272
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,080
this effectively completes the combustion process.    

273
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,350
at the core of those filter elements    

274
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,886
are heating strips made of steel fiber,      

275
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,687
which is like dense steel wool.

276
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,558
but the steel is a special mix of alloys   

277
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,094
resistant to high temperatures and corrosion.         

278
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,497
each heating strip goes into a machine      

279
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,433
which repeatedly folds it up then down,         

280
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,370
pleating it like an accordion. 

281
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,640
the thick steel fibers     
are what trap the soot particles

282
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,110
as the engine exhaust flows through.         

283
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,247
an electrical current heats these conductive fibers, 

284
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:34,853
burning off the soot regardless
of engine-exhaust temperatures.

285
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,521
using nickel crimps,      

286
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,590
workers connect -- depending on the filter size --

287
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:42,327
up to seven pleated strips per filter element.      

288
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,930
they press the crimps securely into the steel fiber 

289
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,231
with a press.         

290
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,002
they attach a different type of crimp at the far ends.   

291
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,004
this type has a tab with three holes   

292
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,474
for the electrical connections.

293
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,944
next, they bend the assembled strips into a circle      

294
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,548
and place them inside a perforated steel housing.  

295
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,883
a temporary cardboard spacer  

296
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,486
creates a gap between strips and housing   

297
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,755
to insulate against short circuits.    

298
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,224
the electrical-connection tabs on the ends          

299
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,626
fit through slots at the front.

300
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,696
an insulating block made of mica,         

301
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,164
a non-conductive mineral,   

302
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,099
goes behind the tabs,     

303
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,835
followed by steel-fiber spacers.

304
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,238
all this sets up a clear and strong conductive path   

305
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,175
from the power source to the strips.         

306
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,978
they fasten the insulating block
to the housing.        

307
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,780
then, using tweezers,     

308
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,584
they place a mica spacer in between each pleat.     

309
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,253
this prevents the pleats from touching each other    

310
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,855
and causing a short circuit  

311
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:48,393
as the electrical current passes through the strips.   

312
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:52,263
they place a spacing stick inside each pleat.       

313
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,732
this is just temporary,    

314
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,467
to size the pleat's width uniformly           

315
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,537
until they're cemented permanently in position.    

316
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,674
to do that, workers pour ceramic cement  

317
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,944
into a circular bottom plate made of perforated steel.   

318
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:10,948
the perforations ensure better bonding.     

319
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,621
they spread the cement evenly across the plate...   

320
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:21,226
then position a stainless-steel
tube in the center       

321
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:25,964
to connect this plate to an identical plate on top. 

322
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:31,770
they carefully place the strips
into the cement        

323
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,772
and position the top plate... 

324
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,711
...then add a weight to hold it down        

325
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,180
while it goes into an oven at 85 degrees         

326
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,115
to cure the cement.      

327
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,588
45 minutes later,       

328
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,526
they take it out of the oven and remove the top plate.   

329
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,263
they also remove the spacing sticks and cardboard spacer,  

330
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,066
which are no longer required  

331
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,335
because the spacing is now permanently set in cement.   

332
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,809
they repeat the cementing process with the top plate.  

333
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,945
after a final four hours in the curing oven,      

334
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,348
the electrically heated filter element,        

335
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,816
this diesel filter's key component,         

336
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,019
is completed,         

337
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:24,622
and the main assembly can begin.

338
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,491
the larger the filter,     

339
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,760
the more filter elements it contains          

340
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,495
in its stainless-steel housing.

341
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,963
for this mid-sized model,   

342
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,233
technicians stack four sets of six elements        

343
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:39,137
then connect electrical cables to the tab holes of each one.  

344
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,242
next, technicians install a flow-control valve      

345
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,911
for each stack.        

346
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,046
when activated,        

347
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,248
the valve reduces exhaust flow to that stack,         

348
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,118
enabling the system to automatically clean elements  

349
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,455
by electrically heating the strip.           

350
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,925
an internal computer manages the cleaning cycles.  

351
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:05,063
it uses sensors that detect soot
accumulation in the elements, 

352
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:08,733
isolating and cleaning one or multiple elements at a time.

353
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,671
on the front, techs mount the inlet flange  

354
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,806
through which the dirty diesel exhaust    

355
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,742
enters the filter...      

356
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,944
on top, the outlet flange   

357
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,114
through which that exhaust exits soot-free.
