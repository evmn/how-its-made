00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,850
            narrator:           
    when it comes to windows,   

2
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,253
 there's a variety of materials 
         to choose from.        

3
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,390
   wood windows are typically   
   the most expensive option,   

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,927
        but they are also       
       the most versatile.      

5
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,596
     they can be constructed    
          in any style,         

6
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,100
       stained any shade,       
      or painted any color.     

7
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,871
         wooden windows         
       can be custom made       

8
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,340
       to match the home's      
        existing windows.       

9
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,210
      this style is called      
   a traditional double hung.   

10
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,878
  its upper and lower sections  

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,681
       open independently       
         of each other.         

12
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,484
   manufacturers make windows   
    from a variety of woods.    

13
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,389
  this company uses mahogany, a 
 premium rot-resistant hardwood.

14
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,295
    this computer-guided saw    

15
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:39,031
       cuts pieces of wood      
     to the required length.    

16
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,299
        the next machine,       
       called the jointer,      

17
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,703
        squares the edges       
   and smoothes the surfaces.   

18
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,106
    now, they mill each piece   
       to the final shape.      

19
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,241
    a vacuum holds it steady    

20
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,179
 while a computer-guided router 
  works at it from all angles.  

21
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,315
         the router uses        
    up to 33 different tools    

22
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,384
   from its on-board magazine.  

23
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,187
     this piece will be part    
       of a curved window.      

24
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,258
 one tool cuts the basic shape, 
     another tool profiles,     

25
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,528
    and the other bores holes   
         for the dowels.        

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,233
  twelve different tools later, 
    this is the final shape.    

27
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,303
          an assembler          
   pours glue in the holes...   

28
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,508
  ...then inserts wood dowels.  

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,678
    their unique shape allows   
 the glue to surround the dowel,

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,413
      maximizing adhesion.      

31
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,819
  using the dowels as a guide,  

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,157
  he connects the two vertical  
pieces of the window, the rails,

33
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,494
   with the horizontal pieces,  
           the stiles.          

34
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,964
  this forms the window's sash. 

35
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,767
       he clamps the sash       
      in a hydraulic press.     

36
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,570
         it's calibrated        
   to join the parts together   

37
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,639
   with just the right amount   
          of pressure.          

38
00:02:55,976 --> 00:03:00,311
    he dries the glue with a    
 radio-frequency heating device.

39
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,981
      they return the piece     
  to the computer-guided router 

40
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,183
     for the final milling.     

41
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,053
  this sideways saw cuts a slot 
         down each side         

42
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,121
     for weather stripping.     

43
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,124
    for double hung windows,    

44
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,793
   another tool cuts openings   
         along the edge.        

45
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,063
    these openings will hold    
         weighted cords         

46
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,998
  that counterbalance the sash. 

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,136
then, they put the finished sash
   through a sanding machine.   

48
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,004
 the machine removes tool marks 

49
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,907
      and preps the surface     
       for a paint primer.      

50
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,144
    they install the muntins,   

51
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,280
  short pieces inside the sash  
  that form decorative squares. 

52
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,818
 first, the horizontal muntins, 
     then the vertical ones.    

53
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,388
    each square will contain    
     its own pane of glass.     

54
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,695
  they sand the muntins by hand 

55
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,798
      to smooth the surface     
         for finishing.         

56
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,275
   then, the sash is sprayed    
   with a water-based primer.   

57
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,384
 once the primer dries, the sash
 goes to the glazing department.

58
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:16,721
     this is where they cut     
    the glass panes to size.    

59
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,659
    windows can have single,    
    double, or triple panes,    

60
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,462
          separated by          
     an aluminum spacer bar.    

61
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,400
  this is a single-pane window. 

62
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,002
       the glazer applies       
         a bead of caulk        

63
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,138
       to the inner ledge       
         of the sash...         

64
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,309
  ...then sets the glass on it. 

65
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,752
  he secures the glass in place 
    by one of two methods --    

66
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,156
 either by driving in tiny, flat
  nails called glazing points,  

67
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,024
  or by caulking the perimeter  

68
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,428
   and applying small moldings  
      called glazing beads.     

69
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,438
 the glazing beads are fastened 
 to the sash with small nails.  

70
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,376
    once the glass is secure,   

71
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:16,581
     the worker removes the     
 excess caulk, cleans the glass,

72
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,986
         and inspects it        
   for any marks or scratches.  

73
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,990
         the final step         
   is to install the hardware.  

74
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,593
   it varies by window style.   

75
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,130
      a double-hung window      
  has a bar lift on the bottom  

76
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:36,535
     and a latch that locks     
    together the two sashes.    

77
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,604
      you release the latch     
       to open either one.      

78
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,074
 once the sashes are installed, 

79
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,177
       they can be painted      
  to match any home's exterior. 

80
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,725
narrator: the art of weaving has
been around since the stone age.

81
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,830
     traditional weavers use    
     techniques and designs     

82
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,566
          that reflect          
     their cultural origins.    

83
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,836
    today's fashion industry    
   has built on this tradition  

84
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,206
 to produce fine wool garments. 

85
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,242
     designers keep a record    

86
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,246
of the fabrics they have created
         over the years.        

87
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,584
they pin samples in books based 
on quality, colors, and patterns

88
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,019
       for their customers      
         to choose from.        

89
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,457
 this is what cashmere goat hair
           looks like           

90
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,359
         when it arrives        
        at the wool mill.       

91
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,999
  short fibers, called flocks,  
  go through a carding machine. 

92
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,937
this machine opens up the fibers
   and mixes colors together.   

93
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,740
       the carding process      
       removes impurities       

94
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,942
     and reduces the fibers     
        to a flat layer.        

95
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,682
        the machine combs       
  and twists the layer of fiber 

96
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,384
  in preparation for spinning.  

97
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,961
 the spinner separates the layer
          into threads          

98
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,732
       and winds each one       
  on bobbins of over 40 pounds. 

99
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,639
     an operator loads yarn     
     into a dyeing machine.     

100
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,809
 the entire fiber-drying process

101
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,679
      takes about two hours     
      for a reel this size.     

102
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,256
     uncarded locks of hair     
        called wool tops        

103
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,358
 are used to make worsted yarn. 

104
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,198
 a worker feeds the ribbon-like 
 thread into a blending machine.

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,735
      the blending process      
      merges twelve threads     

106
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,204
      into one large strip.     

107
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,541
      the machine re-combs      
 and twists the blended fibers, 

108
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,878
         then spins them        
      into a single strand.     

109
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,483
    the coning machine winds    
 the single thread around a cone

110
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,886
      by pulling it through     
       a tensioning device      

111
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,955
    with a series of spindles   
           underneath.          

112
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,760
 this machine can comb 20 pounds
   of wool in about one hour.   

113
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,601
 another spinning machine slowly
  unwinds worsted-wool bobbins. 

114
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,977
  it accelerates as the threads 
 run through a tensioning device

115
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,912
       and onto spindles.       

116
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,382
           even though          
      the machine processes     

117
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,651
        dozens of bobbins       
         simultaneously,        

118
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,687
     this process will last     
         several hours.         

119
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,458
  the set of threads that will  
     make up the woven cloth    

120
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,193
       is called the warp.      

121
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,263
  hundreds of parallel threads  
      wind up on this roll,     

122
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,265
   called the warping machine.  

123
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,135
     these rolls can stretch    
       several miles long.      

124
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,549
      the warp is now ready     
          for weaving.          

125
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,618
        this shuttle loom       
  holds the warp under tension  

126
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
      while it interweaves      
   the over and under threads   

127
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,823
         using two sets         
       of weaving needles.      

128
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,365
 this moving part, the beater,  
 keeps the fabric under tension 

129
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,935
   as it comes out of the loom  
    and onto the cloth beam.    

130
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,441
        this rapier loom        
        can weave fabrics       

131
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,577
    four or five times faster   
 than an automatic shuttle loom,

132
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,481
   and about 200 times faster   
   than a hand-operated loom.   

133
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,053
      the completed fabric      
    goes to quality control.    

134
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,855
        a worker performs       
         a visual check,        

135
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,793
     looking for any defects    
         in the fabric.         

136
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:59,197
  if she finds a broken thread, 
     she repairs it by hand.    

137
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,799
     using a sewing needle,     

138
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,802
 she replaces the broken thread 
         with a new one.        

139
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,143
         once the fabric        
     passes quality control,    

140
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,879
         it goes through        
  a two-hour cleaning process.  

141
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,882
  then, the cloth rolls through 
       a steaming machine       

142
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:21,086
     before accumulating at     
 the end of the production line.

143
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,425
      the finishing process     
        for a woven cloth       

144
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,561
     can take up to a week.     

145
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,230
   designers study the fabrics  

146
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,633
     and choose arrangements    
      to make a collection.     

147
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,903
   they mark selected patterns  
 with codes and cut out samples.

148
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,709
 then they make a sample booklet
        of their fabrics        

149
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,579
  for customers to choose from. 

150
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,248
      the fabric collection     
      changes twice a year,     

151
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,952
    providing a wide variety    
 of styles suited to the season.

152
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:05,530
      narrator: plastic is      
 a convenient form of packaging,

153
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,732
       but can be harmful       
       to the environment.      

154
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,400
 most plastics don't decompose, 

155
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,003
  so they litter the landscape  
            forever.            

156
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,404
   machines called granulators  

157
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,340
          can help ease         
     this pollution problem.    

158
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,476
  they grind the plastic waste  
         into tiny chips        

159
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,478
   that can then be recycled.   

160
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,284
   granulators greatly reduce   

161
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,453
       the amount of waste      
       we humans produce.       

162
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,359
  instead of throwing plastics  
  like these milk crates away,  

163
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,827
       they can be tossed       
        in a granulator.        

164
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,763
       they chop the waste      
       into little pieces,      

165
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,100
        which can be used       
 to make new plastic containers.

166
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,904
   making a granulator starts   
     with star-shaped rotors    

167
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,940
    that will hold and rotate   
  the blades of the granulator. 

168
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,513
        a worker machines       
  the center hole of the rotor  

169
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,249
       so that it will fit      
         a steel shaft.         

170
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,454
    employees slide the shaft   
through the center of the rotor.

171
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,126
multiple rotors are machined and
  installed on the steel shaft. 

172
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,629
         the rotors are         
      spaced evenly apart.      

173
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,402
      a member of the team      
 welds the rotors to the shaft. 

174
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,404
these welds will stop the rotors

175
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,274
  from sliding out of position  
        during grinding.        

176
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,082
 next, steel blades are exposed 
 to intense heat for 12 hours.  

177
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,752
      once they're red hot,     

178
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,555
    an employee plunges them    
        into cooling oil.       

179
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,759
      this removes stresses     
   and strengthens the metal.   

180
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,497
     next, a grinding wheel     
 refines the shape of the blade 

181
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,633
      so it will fit nicely     
         to the rotors.         

182
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:56,274
 it also hones the cutting edge 
   until it's extremely sharp.  

183
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,046
          they transfer         
  the rotor-and-shaft assembly  

184
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,514
       to a metal cradle.       

185
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,519
  this rotor system is smaller  
 than the one assembled earlier.

186
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,321
  it also has triangular rotors 

187
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:14,459
       designed to chop up      
          plastic jugs.         

188
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,495
   a worker screws six blades   
         to the rotors.         

189
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,266
  he then attaches four blades  
         to the casing,         

190
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:27,205
placing them at different angles
    than the rotating blades.   

191
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:32,943
   together, these blades will  
 chop plastic very effectively. 

192
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,348
 but, the gap between the blades
     needs to be fine-tuned.    

193
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,487
    a worker adjusts the gap    
      to the optimal width.     

194
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,629
        now, it's over to       
 the granulator's lower casing. 

195
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:55,099
     a rotating blade shaves    
   the edges to specification.  

196
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,974
  the next worker spray paints  
     the outer-casing parts.    

197
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:10,315
     this protects the steel    
           from rust.           

198
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,317
     after the paint dries,     

199
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,586
  they install the blade system 
       in the outer casing      

200
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:18,589
   and add a wire-mesh screen.  

201
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,191
  the screen acts as a sifter,  

202
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,861
      allowing only plastic     
   small enough for recycling   

203
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,664
  to travel through the holes.  

204
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:31,669
     now, the upper housing     
 is lowered onto the blade unit.

205
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,805
          a long hinge          
     is added into the holes    

206
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,176
    so the plastic granulator   
 can be opened for maintenance. 

207
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:47,552
  they give the blade system a  
 test spin, and it turns freely.

208
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:52,156
   another employee assembles   
  a hopper for the granulator.  

209
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,359
    he drapes a steel curtain   
        over the opening        

210
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,697
           to keep in           
    any flying plastic chips.   

211
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,701
 using a crane, the team lowers 
 the hopper onto the granulator.

212
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,706
          they confirm          
     that the two components    

213
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,042
     are correctly aligned,     
     and bolt them together.    

214
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,850
 next, a 50 horsepower motor is 
installed below the blade shaft.

215
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,851
    then, they loop a pulley    
         from a flywheel        

216
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,788
on the blade shaft to the motor.

217
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,324
     now, the workers cover     
   the pulley system and motor  

218
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,726
     with the steel housing.    

219
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,862
   then, a drawer is installed  

220
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:34,732
  to collect the plastic chips  
          as they fall.         

221
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:39,070
        they're now ready       
   to power up the granulator.  

222
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,740
 every machine is tested before 
      it leaves the factory     

223
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,442
           to confirm           
   that it's fully functional.  

224
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,751
     this plastic granulator    
          is now ready          

225
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,821
 to take on the growing problem 
        of plastic waste.       

226
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,237
 narrator: glass lends a sparkle
        to any interior.        

227
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,440
      from a bathroom sink      
         to a staircase,        

228
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,044
   architectural glass is both  
    functional and artistic.    

229
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:25,183
the glass can be either handmade
     or mechanically formed.    

230
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,655
 it's called architectural glass

231
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,858
  because an architect usually  
 designs its aesthetic features 

232
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,295
         and the objects        
 the glass will be paired with. 

233
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,066
       this company fuses       
    multiple sheets of glass,   

234
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,068
           each about           
   a quarter of an inch thick,  

235
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,471
  to create a finished product  
        of any thickness.       

236
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,479
        for example, this       
  soon-to-be kitchen countertop 

237
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,181
uses 5 sheets of standard glass.

238
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,553
     grabbing one at a time     
   with handled suction cups,   

239
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,788
      they gently place it      

240
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,690
   on a pneumatically operated  
         cutting table.         

241
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,426
      they measure and cut      
        the correct size        

242
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,296
      using a square angle      
    with a diamond tip blade.   

243
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,035
 diamonds are the only material 
       that can cut glass.      

244
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:26,177
 this kiln is a specialized oven
        for baking glass.       

245
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,113
      a craftsman sprinkles     
          white powder          

246
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,048
   onto the base of the kiln.   

247
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,885
 the powder will leave a texture
     in the sheet of glass.     

248
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,589
       next, he sprinkles       
    ground-up, colored glass    

249
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,391
     across the glass sheet     

250
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,128
 to give the kitchen countertop 
     a unique color scheme.     

251
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,331
     they sandwich the glass    
  with another sheet of glass,  

252
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,066
 repeating this coloring process

253
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,102
            with each           
    of the remaining layers.    

254
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,947
  once the last sheet of glass  
        is put in place,        

255
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,982
   they clean the top surface.  

256
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,457
now, it's time to close the kiln
       and bake the glass.      

257
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:26,370
inside the kiln, the five layers
       fuse into one unit.      

258
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,177
    at another kiln, a stack    
of glass has been fused together

259
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,979
 and is ready for the next step.

260
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,446
      workers open the kiln     

261
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,650
   and carefully transfer the   
  newly formed glass countertop 

262
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,252
      onto a rolling cart.      

263
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,395
      they take the counter     
    to the polishing machine.   

264
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,797
     with stones and water,     

265
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,799
           the machine          
      grinds down the edges     

266
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,202
       until the layering       
      is no longer visible.     

267
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,806
  the finished glass countertop 

268
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,143
        is strong enough        
     to span over nine feet     

269
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,044
   without structural support.  

270
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,883
         and because of         
the heating-and-cooling process,

271
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,820
 the glass is now scratch-proof 
       and chip-resistant.      

272
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,957
     you can even chop food     
    directly on the surface.    

273
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,693
      at a different kiln,      
     they're making a sink.     

274
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:25,629
         first, they use        
     a textured glass stamp     

275
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,632
       to press a pattern       
         in the powder.         

276
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,970
  then, they place three layers 
   of glass over the pattern,   

277
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,839
  carefully aligning the edges. 

278
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,981
          after baking,         
   the three layers are fused   

279
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,651
 into one thick circle of glass.

280
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,986
     the bottom of the glass    

281
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,854
    has taken on the pattern    
         of the powder,         

282
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,790
     leaving a unique look.     

283
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,026
          this will be          
the outside surface of the sink.

284
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,266
      they place the glass      
     over a sink-shaped mold    

285
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,935
  in a different type of kiln.  

286
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:11,675
  over several hours, the glass 
melts into the sink-shaped mold.

287
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:16,180
      once the glass cools,     
they extract what is now a sink.

288
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,686
   they carefully measure and   
 mark where the drain hole goes,

289
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,555
    then they drill the hole    
       with a diamond bit.      

290
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,426
  this generates a lot of heat, 

291
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,096
    so they must continuously   
  cool the bit with cold water. 

292
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:36,233
       otherwise, the tool      
     could overheat and jam.    

293
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,503
   the glass sink is finished.  

294
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,041
   they use the same technique  

295
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,411
     to produce glass sinks     
  in various colors and shapes. 

296
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,784
     sometimes, these sinks     

297
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,387
       are even integrated      
     with glass countertops.    

298
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,923
         countless other        
   interior-design components   

299
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,659
           can be made          
    from architectural glass.
