00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,773
captions paid for by discovery communications    

3
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,321
narrator: egyptian pharaohs were likely the first     

4
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:59,257
to have molds made of their bodies and the images cast.  

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,727
today, anyone can have this done.   

6
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,597
the experts have it down to a fine art.         

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,399
it's called life casting, or body molding,        

8
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,603
and it's in demand       
because every body is different.

9
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,275
need a body double?      

10
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:19,612
life casting creates replicas of body parts         

11
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:23,649
that can be used as personal mementos or movie props.    

12
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:30,489
they start by applying cold cream to the body part.  

13
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,225
the cream will serve as a release agent,       

14
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,295
allowing the mold to be removed whole.      

15
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:39,698
this orange goop is the molding material.    

16
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,968
it's a seaweed-based substance called alginate.        

17
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,972
it's the same stuff the dentist
uses to take molds of teeth,  

18
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,708
but it's formulated to set more slowly.      

19
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,778
the life caster spreads the alginate liberally 

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,515
onto this young actor's clenched fist and arm.     

21
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,785
alginate cures in five or six minutes,    

22
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,054
so there's no time to waste.  

23
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,656
he works at a steady pace.   

24
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:09,462
he applies wet plaster bandages
to the alginate.        

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,401
the bandages adhere and form a stiff shell     

26
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,936
similar to a cast for a broken limb.       

27
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,806
the cast-like shell supports the alginate     

28
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,809
as it cures to the shape of the boy's fist       

29
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,478
to produce a mold of it.    

30
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,484
when cured, the alginate has a firm yet rubbery consistency.

31
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,754
it takes a few tugs to pull off the mold,     

32
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,623
but the rubbery nature of the alginate        

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,627
means it can be done without cracking or crumpling. 

34
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,564
the casting material is durable dental plaster.   

35
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,800
he pours it into the mold.   

36
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,706
he tips out a bit to get rid of bubbles     

37
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,776
that have accumulated on the surface.        

38
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:59,778
it's hands off now as the plaster cures      

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,648
because a chemical reaction makes it dangerously hot.   

40
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,718
a half-hour later, the plaster is cooled     

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,056
and hardened into the shape of the boy's fist.       

42
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:14,460
the plaster has picked up all the little details,    

43
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,663
including the tiniest of creases.    

44
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:22,334
he picks out bits of alginate lodged in the creases.     

45
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,203
he defines the fingernails   

46
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,273
and cleans up a few pits and bubbles.          

47
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:33,345
this is the actor's real hand, and this is the replica.    

48
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,215
next, they make a mold of the actor's face.      

49
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,684
they apply cream to his hair  

50
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,621
to prevent it from becoming stuck in the alginate.

51
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,958
the team completely coats his face, ears, and upper chest

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,627
with blue alginate.      

53
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,696
it must be hard not to wince, 

54
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:55,167
but he can't budge in order to create a good impression.  

55
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,772
they leave the back of his head
uncovered for an open mold   

56
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,908
and create two small holes for breathing.         

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,511
they layer the plaster bandages
over the alginate       

58
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,781
to give structure to the mold. 

59
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,617
it also makes him look mummified.        

60
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,191
after several minutes, the mold has solidified.    

61
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,861
the team removes it from the subject.       

62
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:25,730
now that his features have been
successfully transferred    

63
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,400
to the alginate, he can breathe easy.      

64
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:34,440
the life caster trims excess alginate,     

65
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,809
then wraps fabric around the mold        

66
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,678
to build a kind of wall to contain spills       

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,814
as he fills it with plaster.  

68
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,952
the plaster casting may not be the final one.   

69
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,221
depending on the client's wishes,    

70
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,624
they may make a mold from this bust         

71
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,293
and then cast the image in a more flesh-like material 

72
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,895
like silicone, foam, or rubber.

73
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,899
the plaster is cured and the wait is over.     

74
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:06,172
it's time to peel off the layers
and find the face within.   

75
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,411
it's a bit like        
he's removing an intricate mask.

76
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,784
the face behind it is instantly recognizable.   

77
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,056
he cleans out the eyes and nose...          

78
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,765
...and scrubs the entire plaster face.    

79
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,942
here's the actor and his plaster doppelganger. 

80
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,013
they'll use it to create a silicone version, 

81
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,082
and once it's painted and given hair,        

82
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,518
it will be ready for the movies.

83
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,165
narrator: in contrast to a big, traditional hood,  

84
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,767
which is separate from the stove,        

85
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,970
a downdraft system vents smoke,
steam, and cooking odors    

86
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,773
without being conspicuous.   

87
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:18,177
the ventilation unit      
is actually part of the cooktop,

88
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:23,349
and that opens up a lot    
of kitchen-design possibilities.

89
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,453
invented in the 1960s,     

90
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,123
the downdraft cooktop can solve some design dilemmas.

91
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,928
installed in a center island, it offers a clear line of view 

92
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,631
where a traditional hood would block it.        

93
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,268
production starts with the burner box.      

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,272
they'll make three from this steel sheet.     

95
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,207
a computer guides tools    

96
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,543
as they cut holes and notches in the steel.         

97
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,880
it also roughs out the shape of the boxes     

98
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,616
and makes slots for the downdraft ventilation intake. 

99
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:04,023
after the sheets have been cut into individual units,     

100
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,960
a worker serves them up to a computerized brake press. 

101
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,629
the computer controls the stops

102
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,033
that position the sheet    
to be bent at the correct angle.

103
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:21,373
this transforms the steel sheet
into a box.          

104
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:26,912
they're now ready to build the downdraft ventilation system.  

105
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,518
the worker           
inserts the fan blower and motor

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,519
into an assembly fixture.   

107
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:39,191
he then places a metal part, known as the plenum, over it. 

108
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,593
the plenum is the intake duct. 

109
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,996
he places a mesh guard over the opening        

110
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:47,032
through which steam and cooking fumes will flow.  

111
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:53,071
he secures everything with four nuts and studs.   

112
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:58,210
he caps the nuts with rubber plugs to seal the gaps. 

113
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,682
he now transfers the fan and duct assembly       

114
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,417
to another fixture.      

115
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,021
it allows him to correctly position the burner box    

116
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,090
on the ventilation system.   

117
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,430
he plugs the blower motor into a junction box.      

118
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,169
he places a metal frame around the plenum       

119
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,773
and screws it in place to secure
the plenum to the burner box. 

120
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,644
next, he assembles the knob switches 

121
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,913
that turn the burners on and off.            

122
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:39,184
he adds rubber insulators to keep water out of the switches.

123
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,719
he covers them with a metal plate       

124
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,856
with holes           
for the knob shafts to protrude.

125
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:49,461
he installs the lighting system

126
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,498
that indicates whether the burners are on or off.   

127
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,669
next, an employee slots the switch system    

128
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,672
into the ceramic cooktop through the back.       

129
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,942
he inserts the radiant heating elements  

130
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,411
into the holes in the cooktop. 

131
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:10,281
the elements are different sizes
to accommodate different pots, 

132
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,018
and they have different heating capacities.      

133
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,487
he wires the switches to the elements,        

134
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:19,925
and he ties them to the main power cord.    

135
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,697
another worker screws the elements to a metal bracket

136
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,701
that's glued to the underside of the ceramic cooktop,    

137
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,905
and he completes the wiring work.        

138
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,311
the ceramic cooktop is complete

139
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,981
and ready to be joined to the downdraft ventilation unit.

140
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,585
he aligns the hole in the center
with the intake duct.     

141
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,054
he feeds the wires from the cooktop        

142
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:53,192
through holes in the burner box
to the junction box.      

143
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:57,663
he screws the junction box   
to the bottom of the burner box.

144
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:02,200
he pulls the main power harness 
through a hole in the burner box

145
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:06,271
and secures it to the box   
with a metal bracket and screws.

146
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,744
he adjusts the ceramic cooktop,

147
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,948
which moved out of alignment a bit during the wiring,    

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,483
and then equips the cooktop with knobs           

149
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,953
which fit snugly to the protruding pins.    

150
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,289
and it's over to a test station.

151
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,160
the operator connects a computer
to the downdraft cooktop.   

152
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,694
she turns the knobs,      

153
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,665
and the computer measures the power consumed by the elements.

154
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:37,302
some elements are the same size
but different wattages.    

155
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,503
the test confirms       

156
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,373
that the elements are in the correct slots    

157
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,776
and that all burners are operational.        

158
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,847
it's taken 25 minutes to    
assemble this downdraft cooktop.

159
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,584
the downdraft ventilation unit 

160
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,987
will get rid of moisture and odors discreetly.     

161
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,457
it's now time to turn up the heat      

162
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,792
with no worries about the fallout.       

163
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,809
narrator: if you've got varicose veins, 

164
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,679
leg fatigue, ankle swelling, or other circulation disorders,

165
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,081
your doctor may prescribe compression hosiery,      

166
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,350
pressured stockings that squeeze your legs     

167
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,019
primarily at the ankle     

168
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,754
and, to a lesser extent, in other areas         

169
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:34,158
to help the blood in your veins
travel back to the heart.   

170
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,763
they don't look like      
ugly old-lady stockings anymore.

171
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:41,499
today's compression hosiery comes in a range of colors   

172
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,970
and pantyhose, thigh-high, and knee-high versions.    

173
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,574
the doctor prescribes the compression strength you need. 

174
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:52,710
that's the pressure at the ankle
in millimeters mercury,    

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,782
the same measuring unit    
used in blood-pressure readings.

176
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,383
the hosiery is knitted     

177
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,987
out of stretchy spandex and nylon yarns.        

178
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,389
the computerized knitting machine        

179
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,925
interlocks yarn strands vertically and horizontally.  

180
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,997
this two-direction knit gives the stocking a two-way stretch.

181
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,067
however, it's the horizontal yarn in the knit

182
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,336
that provides the doctor's strength prescription.     

183
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,672
they program the knitting machine      

184
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:24,276
to produce a run of a specific size and prescription.     

185
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,612
it automatically varies the stitch and yarn tension  

186
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,882
to apply 100% of the prescribed
pressure at the ankle,     

187
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:35,354
65% at the calf, and 30% at the thigh.     

188
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,290
stronger pressure at the bottom point      

189
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,159
forces blood upward toward the heart.       

190
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,495
the machine outputs stocking-length tubes, 

191
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,500
which sewers skillfully transform into the final shape.

192
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,503
the first sewer turns the tube inside out   

193
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,505
and stitches the toe closed.  

194
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,974
then she stretches those stitches         

195
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,845
to flatten the seam so it'll be
comfortable on the foot.    

196
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,315
if they're making pantyhose, another sewer slits that tube 

197
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,583
partway down the inside of the leg     

198
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:09,187
so it can be joined to another leg.        

199
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,723
the next sewer takes a leg   

200
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,592
and stitches it to a triangular cotton gusset, 

201
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,195
which forms the crotch of the pantyhose.       

202
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,266
these are maternity hose,   

203
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,970
so she also sews in a stretchy stomach panel.   

204
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,013
then she sews a big u-shaped seam at the front,  

205
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,482
joining the second leg to the other parts.      

206
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,885
whether it's a multiple-component pantyhose 

207
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,889
or a simple single thigh-high or knee-high stocking,     

208
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,960
the production steps      
from this point on are the same.

209
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:53,498
workers slide each stocking onto a heated aluminum leg form

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,902
in the size they're producing in this run.          

211
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,237
laser lines show exactly where to align the heel

212
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,573
and other parts on the form.  

213
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,974
then, one by one,       

214
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,911
the forms enter a pressurized steam chamber  

215
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,579
for about four seconds.    

216
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,849
this quick steam treatment is enough           

217
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,852
to permanently lock      
the form's shape into the nylon.

218
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,191
the form then enters a dryer, 

219
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,926
where it stops for about 15 seconds.     

220
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,931
the hot forced air evaporates the steam-infused moisture.  

221
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:29,267
when the stocking finally comes off the form,  

222
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,837
it's dry and leg-shaped.    

223
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,875
workers now group the stockings
into 10-pair stacks,      

224
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,811
put each stack inside a specific color bag  

225
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,748
to identify its style and size,

226
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,552
then load the bags in this high-tech dye machine. 

227
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,823
they key in the program which automatically controls  

228
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,092
every aspect of dyeing the stockings    

229
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,228
from water levels and temperature to dye injection. 

230
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,366
for one hour, the machine washes the stockings.     

231
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:05,303
then, over the next five hours,
it dyes them,         

232
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:09,107
adding chemicals to make the water acidic,   

233
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,110
which draws the dye like a sponge         

234
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,912
permanently into the yarn fibers.     

235
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,117
the compression stockings knit,
sewn, shaped, and dyed     

236
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,454
are now ready to be inspected and packaged. 

237
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:26,658
the factory pulls a set number of random samples per day   

238
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,193
from the production line    

239
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,595
and tests them on this extension machine.   

240
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,665
it stretches the hose to test the tensile strength, 

241
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,400
and it measures the compression

242
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,269
at the different points of the leg.          

243
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,605
every single pair of stockings 

244
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:45,243
undergoes a visual inspection prior to packaging.      

245
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,816
then the packager neatly folds it around a cardboard insert,  

246
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,086
slips it inside an adhesive-sealed plastic bag,

247
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,156
and inserts it into the retail box.      

248
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:02,894
compression stockings are classified as a medical device.

249
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,430
the sealed bag assures the customer      

250
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,700
that the stockings are a brand-new, unused pair, 

251
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,402
and therefore, hygienic.    

252
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,986
narrator: looking to drive motorcycle  

253
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,522
without ever having to stop for a fill-up, change the oil, 

254
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,790
top off the fluids,      

255
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,725
or repair a transmission, clutch, and cooling system?  

256
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,528
and do you want a quiet motor 

257
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,063
that doesn't contribute to air pollution?       

258
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,799
then an electric motorcycle  

259
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:45,002
may be just the set of wheels you're looking for.      

260
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,940
an electric motorcycle lends a whole new meaning   

261
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,209
to the term "plug and play."  

262
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,813
you charge the bike's battery by plugging in         

263
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,816
to a standard 120-volt household electrical outlet.  

264
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,353
a full charge takes eight hours,
but you can buy an add-on device

265
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,822
to cut that charging time in half.            

266
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,825
the bike's journey begins on a sketch pad.        

267
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:11,362
an industrial designer draws an artistic conception, 

268
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,833
creating the aesthetics such as lines and colors    

269
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:19,104
as well as the ergonomics, such
as seat and mirror positioning.

270
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,706
the designer transforms the sketches    

271
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,375
into a computer model     

272
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,912
to which engineers then add the mechanics.    

273
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:31,115
the motorcycle's battery contains four cell boxes.   

274
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:36,388
to link all the cell boxes, they
install two interconnect boards.

275
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,189
then, into each board,     

276
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,726
they plug the connectors from two cell boxes.      

277
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,463
they use lots of grease to waterproof the battery   

278
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:50,001
and protect it against corrosion
caused by road salt or sea air. 

279
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:56,207
next, they plug wires coming  
from the two interconnect boards

280
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,343
into a circuit board.     

281
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,878
this circuit board is the battery's brain.    

282
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,815
it regulates the voltages of the individual cells    

283
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,084
to prevent overheating.    

284
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,853
then the charging components. 

285
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,292
technicians now close up the fully assembled battery  

286
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:18,029
with protective covers and run it through a function test.

287
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,165
the test simulates the discharge of the battery  

288
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,635
that happens when you ride the bike,    

289
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:26,638
then the recharge that occurs when you plug in.       

290
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,241
all the cell voltages must balance in the process.  

291
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,644
the motorcycle frame is made of high-strength,   

292
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,913
lightweight, aircraft-grade aluminum.    

293
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,384
at the tail end, they install the controller,  

294
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:42,253
the link between the battery and the throttle,       

295
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,256
which controls the electricity flow to the motor.       

296
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,459
they mount the suspension system,     

297
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,726
an aluminum swingarm      

298
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,329
that attaches to the rear wheel on one end  

299
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,131
and to the frame on the other 

300
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,533
via a spring-shaped shock absorber,        

301
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,136
which expands and contracts to dampen bounce 

302
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,206
as the wheel moves up and down over bumps in the road.    

303
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,542
they mount the motor.     

304
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,411
the battery's electrical current

305
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,680
rotates the motor via the controller,      

306
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:12,050
which turns the drive belt, spinning the bike's rear wheel.

307
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,287
this belt's maintenance-free  

308
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,889
because it's made of high-strength rubber,    

309
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,425
further reinforced with the material used     

310
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,094
to make bulletproof vests.   

311
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,763
they install the upper triple clamp,    

312
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,767
which carries the dash, horn, turn signals,         

313
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,102
and ignition switch.      

314
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,304
then the handlebars.      

315
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,507
there are several components already mounted to them,    

316
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,310
including the front brake lever,
the throttle,         

317
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,645
and control switches.     

318
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,648
then technicians        
slide the battery into the frame

319
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,984
and connect it to the motor and controller.        

320
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,588
this motorcycle has no transmission, no gears, 

321
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,391
no clutch, no cooling system to maintain or repair.     

322
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,196
the motor's fins adequately dissipate heat buildup.    

323
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,268
next, two aluminum forks to hold the front wheel axle. 

324
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,871
workers position them inside the upper triple clamp 

325
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,740
and a second triple clamp lower down.          

326
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,210
but they don't install the front wheel just yet.   

327
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,413
they first mount the rear wheel.

328
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,881
it has a rubber tire,     

329
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,951
hydraulic brakes activated by a foot lever,   

330
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,687
and a sprocket for the drive belt.      

331
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:26,023
they place the drive belt around the sprocket.      

332
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,360
now, when the motor runs, the rear wheel turns.     

333
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,495
after mounting the front wheel,

334
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,565
they install the bike's plastic body parts. 

335
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,301
there's a storage area     

336
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:40,171
where gas motorcycles would have their fuel tank.  

337
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:44,309
there are four chargers located underneath the battery.

338
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,578
their wiring culminates in a single port        

339
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,181
in which you plug a cable to recharge.          

340
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:55,320
every motorcycle this factory produces     

341
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:59,323
undergoes an extensive indoor road test on a dynamometer,  

342
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,858
a driving simulator      

343
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,861
that assesses the performance of every component.      

344
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,329
although very quiet,      

345
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:09,467
the bike's as powerful as a  
midsize, gasoline-run motorcycle

346
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,937
and can reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.  

347
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,873
when the battery needs a quick recharge,    

348
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,008
you can pull over       

349
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,744
at a roadside electric-vehicle charging station        

350
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,013
and fill her up in less than an hour.     

351
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,891
