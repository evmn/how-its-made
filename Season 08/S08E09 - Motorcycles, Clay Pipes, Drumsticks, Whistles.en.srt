narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,327
pro hockey sticks.       

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,033
bronzed baby shoes.      

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,738
treadmills.          

7
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,545
and handheld computers.    

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,653
today's cutting-edge hockey sticks         

9
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,321
are made primarily of graphite,

10
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,458
a strong yet lightweight material woven from carbon.  

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,992
professional hockey players  

12
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,462
have their graphite sticks custom-made.          

13
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,632
each player has the curve and angle of the blade tailored

14
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,133
to precise specifications   

15
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,136
that he believes enhance his performance on the ice.  

16
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,943
to construct the stick's hollow shaft,         

17
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,412
workers layer 15 sheets of graphite,          

18
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,149
each in a different direction to
make the shaft uniformly rigid. 

19
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:29,488
heat-activated resin molds the layers together.   

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,890
this machine, called a flex tester,     

21
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:36,828
measures how much force it takes
to bend the shaft one inch.  

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,164
if the force is within a certain range,        

23
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,701
the shaft has the correct degree
of stiffness for that model.  

24
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,175
the blade starts with the plastic core.     

25
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,510
in the center,         

26
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,512
there's a piece of hard foam wrapped in graphite.      

27
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,848
it absorbs the impact of the puck.          

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,384
later, they'll mold the core to the shaft,         

29
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,888
but for now, they glue and clamp them together.    

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,859
when the glue dries,      

31
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,662
they cover the core in a graphite sock.      

32
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,531
the sock fibers run diagonally.

33
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,001
the fibers of subsequent layers
run in other directions,    

34
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,804
building a combination of crisscross fibers      

35
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,107
that creates uniform stiffness throughout the blade.     

36
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,612
now the core goes into a glue applicator.    

37
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,583
this heat-activated plastic resin permeates the graphite. 

38
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,753
once it cures, it will fortify the material. 

39
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,689
on the next two layers of graphite are strips.    

40
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,958
on one, the fibers run vertically.   

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,793
on the other, they run diagonally.      

42
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,736
they're stiffer because they've 
already had a resin application.

43
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,774
they run through the glue applicator      

44
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,775
and go onto the core.     

45
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,912
this is how the factory builds its graphite blades,  

46
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,448
whether mass producing amateur sticks         

47
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,518
or making a few special-order sticks for a pro player.    

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,853
at this point,         

49
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,788
retail sticks head into large-scale        

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,256
automated production.     

51
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,926
workers continue making pro sticks by hand.      

52
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,996
initially, they produce a customized wooden mold    

53
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,530
for each player's stick    

54
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:24,203
and give it an identification number to prevent mix-ups.   

55
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:29,007
they install this two-piece mold
on a press.          

56
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,809
the press shapes the blade   

57
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,478
to the player's precise specifications,    

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,481
for the face, or vertical angle,
and the curve.         

59
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:40,018
this molding process also compresses the graphite layers 

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,420
into a single unit       

61
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,556
and bonds the blade to the shaft permanently.   

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,564
the plastic bag over the blade 

63
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,535
prevents excess resin from oozing all over the press.

64
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:07,045
using a router, they profile the blade to a specific shape. 

65
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,114
each pro player orders his own personal template.       

66
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:14,319
it can be any shape, provided it abides by nhl regulations. 

67
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,056
maximum curve -- half an inch, maximum height -- 3 inches,  

68
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,093
maximum length -- 12 1/2 inches.

69
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,131
now, a good sanding.      

70
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,470
and a thorough buffing.    

71
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,946
they dip the blades in urethane,

72
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,150
a colorless coating that fills in tiny imperfections  

73
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,718
on the surface.        

74
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,839
once that dries,        

75
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,976
a machine sprays silver paint at the base of the shaft.   

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,520
finally, another coat of urethane          

77
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,655
to seal and protect the paint. 

78
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,190
for the retail market,     

79
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:29,194
this company mass produces six 
models of graphite hockey sticks

80
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,997
in a right-handed and left-handed version.    

81
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,132
they all have the same blade shape,          

82
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,333
but different curves.     

83
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,070
you can peel off the removable model-name decal        

84
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,739
and write your own name on the shaft instead.     

85
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:44,009
not nearly as personalized as a made-to-order pro stick, 

86
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,277
but at least you won't leave the arena           

87
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,214
with someone else's hockey stick by mistake.    

88
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,159
narrator: the pitter-patter of little footsteps      

89
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,361
is a welcome sound in any household.        

90
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,696
but children grow by leaps and bounds.      

91
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,700
bronzing baby shoes is one way to preserve the memory     

92
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,569
of those first steps.     

93
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,839
the tradition was started back in the 1930s.       

94
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,248
in these shoes,        

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,985
a child learned to stand on his or her own two feet.  

96
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,321
the baby shoes have joined a pile of others.       

97
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,525
they're all about to be preserved forever.       

98
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,330
they record information about the shoes' owners    

99
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,699
including personal details for engraving.         

100
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,740
they assign a tracking number to each pair.         

101
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,743
without it, some shoes might not
find their way back      

102
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,178
to their owners.        

103
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,885
they stamp that number onto insoles.         

104
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,420
there's a special coating on the insoles         

105
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,624
that will prevent the metal plating from sticking to them, 

106
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,693
so this number will be visible throughout processing.     

107
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,369
they staple down the insoles  

108
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,772
and then dip the shoes in a special formula.      

109
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,507
it chemically seals them    

110
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,178
and will also help stiffen them
as they dry later.       

111
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,384
but first they hang them to  
allow excess liquid to drip off.

112
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,328
they stuff each shoe with plastic          

113
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,796
to give it some shape.     

114
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,406
they push a rolled plastic form
into each shoe         

115
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,942
to complete the shaping.    

116
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,611
they tie the laces,      

117
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,480
positioning the bows flat against the shoes       

118
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,917
so they won't break off during the rest of the process.    

119
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,356
as an extra precaution,    

120
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:15,126
they wrap a rubber band around each bow and then glue it down.

121
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,835
with the shaping plastic removed

122
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,104
and the shoes dried and stiffened,         

123
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,107
they drill holes into the bottoms of the soles. 

124
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,944
this will allow them to be hung
on prongs during plating later.

125
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,317
but before that happens,    

126
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,787
they stir up a mix of water, copper, and other ingredients. 

127
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,928
they carefully submerge a rack full of baby shoes   

128
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,897
into the coppery liquid.    

129
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,003
this isn't the final coating. it's a key preparation step.  

130
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,139
it makes the shoes electrically conductive    

131
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,074
so that they can be electroplated.         

132
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,155
they hang the shoes to dry   

133
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,024
and dribble a little more of the liquid onto them    

134
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,393
to cover any bare spots.    

135
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,701
they allow the finish to dry for a couple of days.     

136
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:33,038
then a worker lowers them into the electroplating tank. 

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,041
an electrical current runs through to the shoes,   

138
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,944
attracting copper in the tank to plate them.         

139
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,716
using a special polishing wheel,

140
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,119
they lightly scratch the bright
copper finish on the shoes.  

141
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,488
this prepares them for the next step.       

142
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,632
they spray a black finish onto the shoes.        

143
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,803
and then wipe it off,     

144
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,804
rubbing some into the crevices 

145
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,407
to give them an antique appearance.     

146
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,652
next, they spray them with a protective lacquer.   

147
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,557
you can still see the identification number clearly 

148
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,028
on the insole, so they haven't lost track of the owner.    

149
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,569
they attach the engraving plate
onto a wood base        

150
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,904
and screw the shoes onto it.  

151
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,373
now they won't be going anywhere,        

152
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,042
except down memory lane.    

153
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,847
and it seems there's no end to the bronze keepsakes    

154
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,716
that can also take you there, 

155
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:55,453
from cowboy boots to burgers on a bun.      

156
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,864
narrator: treadmills were invented back in the 1800s   

157
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,999
for the farm team.       

158
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,267
farmers put animals on treadmills         

159
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,071
to power butter churns and threshing machines.    

160
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:16,006
it wasn't until the middle of the 20th century      

161
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,543
that people started working out
on treadmills,         

162
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,813
and as a fitness concept, it's been a success.      

163
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,556
in these high-tech treadmills, 

164
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,492
computer processors access your level of fitness     

165
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,594
and plot your workout program. 

166
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,635
to make one, they punch holes in aluminum-frame side pieces. 

167
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,973
these holes will be used to attach other parts.     

168
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:53,111
but first, they weld joints to the side pieces.      

169
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,717
and they weld brackets onto the platform       

170
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,086
that will hold the treadmill's motor.     

171
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,661
they position the platform   
between two aluminum side pieces

172
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,065
and screw it into place to complete the frame.     

173
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,335
next, they attach the elevation mechanism.    

174
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,538
this piece will raise the treadmill belt.      

175
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,084
they fasten wheels to the frame

176
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,921
that will allow the treadmill to be rolled away for storage. 

177
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,160
they turn over the treadmill  
frame and work on the underside.

178
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,562
they attach brackets for the rollers        

179
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,164
that go inside the belt.    

180
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,501
then they position the belt and deck over the frame.    

181
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:56,307
they slide in the steel rollers...      

182
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,610
and attach the drive belt.   

183
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,988
they bolt a big shock absorber to the drive motor       

184
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,890
to dampen its vibration.    

185
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,929
they install a strobe disk   

186
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,865
and then place an optical sensor over it.   

187
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,800
with the help of this sensor, 

188
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,536
the strobe will monitor the motor speed        

189
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,639
16 times per second.      

190
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,882
they mount the drive motor for the treadmill belt     

191
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,685
on the special platform and bolt it into place.    

192
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,825
at this point, they attach one of the computer boards.    

193
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,561
it receives information from the optical sensor    

194
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,162
about the treadmill's speed  

195
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,166
and relays it to the computer in the control panel.     

196
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,735
this will ensure that everything
is in sync.          

197
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,574
here, they slide a protective casing over the framework.   

198
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,709
they cap the ends,       

199
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,045
then turn over the machine once more           

200
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,914
to install the mechanism that allows the treadmill   

201
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,450
to be folded up when the workout is over.   

202
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:19,123
they screw a plastic cover onto it to protect the bottom. 

203
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,792
and it's over to the control system.     

204
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,596
they stick the control membrane
onto the plastic housing    

205
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,266
and attach a safety switch to the back.          

206
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,206
then they install the     
treadmill's other computer board

207
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,341
in this housing.        

208
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,747
they plug a lead wire into the safety switch     

209
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,516
and install a receiver to pick up the runner's heart rate.  

210
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,558
they secure the handlebar assembly to the control housing

211
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,895
and plug in the upper circuit board.    

212
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,897
now they close the back of the control system,     

213
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,167
and it's time for the two assemblies to come together.  

214
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,105
they connect the upper and lower computer boards   

215
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,375
so they can communicate.    

216
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,444
and then they give the treadmill
a little test run       

217
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,847
to make sure it's in top form. 

218
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,717
they put it through a range of elevations         

219
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,987
and check the belt to determine
if it's running in the middle. 

220
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,528
they adjust the belt to center it a little better.      

221
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,070
and now this treadmill has passed inspection.     

222
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,272
so they wipe away their footprints        

223
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,574
and press the brand label onto the hood.         

224
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,147
they lower the hood onto the motor.        

225
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:56,087
and now, this treadmill is ready
to give you a good workout.  

226
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,436
narrator: handhelds, as they're called,       

227
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,238
are rugged computers designed for workers on the move.    

228
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,708
you see them on delivery trucks,
police cruisers,        

229
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,177
forklift trucks, and in large warehouses.    

230
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,646
they process data in virtually any condition,         

231
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,447
from bad weather to rough roads.

232
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,516
so even though you're in the field,      

233
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,118
you're still plugged in.    

234
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,328
from scanning bar codes to reading parking meters,   

235
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,865
handhelds provide information on location.          

236
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,137
they start with the keyboard electronics panel.       

237
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,907
they test each contact for conductivity.       

238
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,880
then they transfer the tracking number      

239
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,483
from the electronics panel to the inner casing,      

240
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,152
so it will be visible if it needs servicing.     

241
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,691
they glue the electronics panel
to the casing with silicone  

242
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,695
for a waterproof seal.     

243
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,564
the rubber keypad goes on next.

244
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,507
then they glue a protective plastic plate over it.     

245
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,983
next, they cut a silicone liner

246
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,319
to the size of the computer screen.    

247
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,121
it will help seal the unit,  

248
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,724
preventing water and dust from getting in.        

249
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,927
they place the liner in a bracket behind the screen 

250
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,063
and then use this jig to align the screen      

251
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,665
to the computer casing.    

252
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,601
a dab of threadlocker glue to the screws         

253
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,737
helps to hold it all together. 

254
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:03,347
the top casing for this handheld
computer is now assembled.   

255
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,885
they move on to the back casing
and install a speaker.     

256
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:11,556
they apply a layer of silicone to a circuit board assembly,  

257
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,958
again, to resist water and dust
from seeping into it.     

258
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,963
this circuit board assembly goes
into a hole in the back casing. 

259
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,299
it will allow the unit     

260
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,369
to communicate with a central computer.    

261
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,637
in the next step,       

262
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,773
they wire the speakers to the circuit board,      

263
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,577
and now the handheld has a sound system.       

264
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,313
more silicone on these connections.     

265
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,450
then they install triggers to the scanner,        

266
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,018
one on each side.       

267
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,922
they install a liner on the door

268
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,225
for the memory card compartment.          

269
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,663
then they run the top assemblies
for three hours        

270
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,298
in extreme temperatures.    

271
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,601
once the inner workings have been completely installed,

272
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,838
they attach the top assemblies to the bottom ones.      

273
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,346
they tuck the battery pack into its compartment      

274
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,215
and install the end cap.    

275
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,652
it has an antenna for wireless communication.  

276
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,356
now they install a smartcard reader,      

277
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,493
because this particular handheld computer will be used 

278
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,129
for security checks on personal i.d. cards.    

279
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,436
they test the laser scanner,  

280
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:35,906
then activate security software
which reads fingerprints,   

281
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,776
allowing this handheld computer
to do security         

282
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,745
or criminal checks on the spot.

283
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,657
when an unregistered person presses a finger        

284
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,459
onto the print reader, this is what happens.      

285
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,664
of course, mobile computers are designed 

286
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,399
to return to a home base,   

287
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,669
where they upload information to a main computer.      

288
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,072
but first, randomly selected units get roughed up      

289
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,874
in a series of tests.     

290
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,811
they toss this unit into a tumbler         

291
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,313
and it gets thrown around.   

292
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,084
then they drop it from a height
of 6 1/2 feet.         

293
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:27,024
they plunge it into a tank of water.     

294
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,561
in the real world, things can be even tougher.  

295
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,331
this computer ended up in a fire.           

296
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,369
and this one was run over.   

297
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,771
but even when it seems     

298
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,773
that they've been completely destroyed,     

299
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,309
information can still be salvaged.          

300
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,444
