narrator: today on "how it's made" --   

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,027
...stile and rail doors...    

5
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,933
...steam cleaners...       

6
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,939
...hand-held pizzas...      

7
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,845
...and power brushes.      

8
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,722
many doors are made of a single piece of wood.    

9
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,859
but stile and rail doors contain a rectangular frame   

10
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:03,062
around one or more central panels.     

11
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:07,333
the term stile refers to the frame's vertical pieces.             

12
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:10,269
and rail refers to its horizontal ones.     

13
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:17,876
stile and rail doors come in many different shapes and sizes.             

14
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,612
they have several components.  

15
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,382
some even have sectioned glass panels.     

16
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:30,289
they use poplar wood for paint-grade doors.      

17
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,291
if the door will be stained,   

18
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:35,361
customers can choose from several different wood options,            

19
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:40,199
including oak, cherry, maple, and african mahogany.   

20
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,770
they feed the rough lumber through a planer.        

21
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,105
the first two stations      

22
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,809
simultaneously shave the top and bottom of the wood.     

23
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,049
the third station has multiple saw blades     

24
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,752
that cut the piece into several strips.       

25
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,492
workers line up the strips and coat one side with glue.   

26
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:15,134
then they transfer the wood strips to a clamping machine.  

27
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,936
they stack one piece of linear-strand lumber     

28
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:23,341
in between the glued sides of two solid-wood strips.    

29
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,145
linear-strand lumber, called lsl for short,      

30
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,682
is a piece of lumber made from glued wood fibers.   

31
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:35,888
the robot holds the assembly in place for an hour       

32
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,224
until the glue dries.      

33
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,630
then they put this engineered lumber through a glue spreader.            

34
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,833
it coats the top and bottom surfaces       

35
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,069
with heat-activated glue.    

36
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,773
they sandwich the lumber     

37
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,044
between two thin sheets of wood called veneer.          

38
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,178
for a paint-grade door,     

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,981
they use ultra-thin mdf,     

40
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,416
medium-density fiberboard, instead.             

41
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,852
mdf is a man-made material    

42
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,055
with a smooth, paint-friendly surface.     

43
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,859
they place the pieces into a hot press for two minutes.   

44
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,995
the heat activates the glue,   

45
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:19,498
while the pressure flattens   
the veneer against the lumber.  

46
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,371
these pieces will become the door's stiles and rails.   

47
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:31,377
the panels inside the stiles and rails are made of mdf.    

48
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:36,415
for a stained door,       

49
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,818
workers apply the veneer before they contour the pieces.             

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,355
workers carve the pieces using a shaper machine.     

51
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,393
they change the machine heads in order to cut different designs.            

52
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,265
the workers used a different shaper machine             

53
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,635
to carve the inside edge of the stiles.          

54
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,637
they also drilled holes for the dowels          

55
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,773
of the adjoining rails.     

56
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,441
they apply glue,         

57
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,912
then attach the matching bottom rail to the first stile.     

58
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,316
they insert the panel into a groove in the rail and stile.             

59
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,786
they are assembling a two-panel door.        

60
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:17,456
so next, they fit a middle rail and another panel.        

61
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,929
they install a top rail and then the second stile.    

62
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,533
they place the newly-assembled door     

63
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,770
in a large clamping machine.   

64
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,344
it applies pressure on the door for an hour           

65
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,547
while the glue dries.      

66
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:50,555
the machine transfers the door to a cutting table.       

67
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:55,127
then a computer-guided saw trims the top and bottom of the door.              

68
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,832
the machine switches to a different tool       

69
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:04,236
that bevels the edge of the door.           

70
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,770
it switches tools again     

71
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,641
and drills holes for the door's hardware.     

72
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,078
the stile and rail door is now ready for finishing.   

73
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,851
workers sand the surface     

74
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:21,854
to prepare it for either staining or painting.            

75
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,527
then the stained doors      

76
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,732
receive a coat of sealer and two coats of clear lacquer.            

77
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,069
this protects the wood's surface.       

78
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,405
the panels used in stile and rail doors     

79
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,273
are never glued in place.    

80
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:45,010
they sit inside the frame.    

81
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,281
this leaves space for the wood and mdf to naturally expand   

82
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,951
without warping or cracking the door.      

83
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,766
narrator: in the 1960s,     

84
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,436
italian boilermakers figured out              
how to harness steam to clean.  

85
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,106
steam cleaning is much safer than traditional methods     

86
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:17,042
because dirt and bacteria can be eliminated        

87
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,311
without the use of harmful chemicals.      

88
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,579
high-pressure, low-moisture steam is enough   

89
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,283
to vaporize most germs.     

90
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,787
the water in a steam cleaner   

91
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,589
is heated to over 200 degrees fahrenheit.           

92
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:36,595
it's safe to use on both hard and soft surfaces.            

93
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,598
steam cleaners start out as a computer design.      

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
this is a commercial model    

95
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,869
that will be used to clean hotels, restaurants,  

96
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,406
offices, and schools.      

97
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:51,644
they make the components using 
polycarbonate plastic pellets.  

98
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,681
a molding machine heats the plastic,        

99
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,051
then injects it into molds.   

100
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,425
the plastic hardens into the shape of parts.     

101
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,561
this one is the cover for the steam cleaner's boiler.             

102
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,000
a robot with vacuum-suction grippers extracts the cover   

103
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,771
from the mold.          

104
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:19,972
they mold other parts,      

105
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,374
including the base, extension tubes,         

106
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:26,711
handles, and hooks the same way.              

107
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:31,583
a worker installs a water-level probe on the steel boiler.    

108
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,920
he also screws on a fitting for the fill hose.        

109
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,725
he adds two solenoid valves.   

110
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:44,663
they turn the steam on and off and control its intensity.    

111
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,133
then he places the boiler in a test device.        

112
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,536
the device verifies that the electrical parts    

113
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:53,205
are insulated properly.     

114
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:58,610
he tightens the solenoid valves to complete the installation.  

115
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,946
after the hoses are attached to the boiler,   

116
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,582
they place it in the base of the steam cleaner.      

117
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,286
a worker plugs in the electrical contacts.   

118
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,423
they will power the steam hose's controls.    

119
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,892
then he connects the steam hose to a fitting           

120
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,794
next to the contacts.      

121
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,868
he tightens a metal clip around it to reinforce the connection.           

122
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,374
he links the main electronic board         

123
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,711
to temperature sensors that have been installed on the boiler.  

124
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:41,320
the worker also wires the steam-pressure sensors.   

125
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:46,524
he covers the top of the boiler with melamine insulation.    

126
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,796
then he slides a heat-resistant         
plastic cover over the boiler.  

127
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,001
he attaches the fill hose to the fitting          

128
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,836
on the top of the boiler.    

129
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,511
he connects the other end to the water tank.        

130
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:14,419
the worker equips the tank with two water-level sensors.  

131
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,490
he hooks up a gauge for the steam pressure.     

132
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,426
then he fills the tank with water            

133
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,561
and tests the steam cleaner.   

134
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:29,635
he uses a small mirror to check for leaks.       

135
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:34,573
another worker assembles the steam gun.     

136
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,576
he attaches a plastic joint to the steam hose,        

137
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
then installs a nozzle on the end.           

138
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:47,119
he slides the joint forward to surround the spray nozzle   

139
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:50,655
and screws a plastic wand to the end of the joint.     

140
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,259
he tucks the hose on one side  
of the handle's plastic casing  

141
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,662
and installs a trigger.     

142
00:09:56,664 --> 00:10:00,865
then he snaps on the cover.   

143
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,735
he screws the handle together.  

144
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:07,405
he connects the steam gun to the boiler unit.       

145
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,807
he turns it on.         

146
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,876
and the sprayer shoots out a hot, pressurized mist     

147
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,278
known as dry steam.       

148
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,947
its moisture content       

149
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,618
is only 5%, allowing cleaned surfaces to dry quickly.            

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,488
the steam cleaner also comes with a vacuum.    

151
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,959
it sucks up residual water and dirt after a steam cleaning.            

152
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,961
he attaches the vacuum motor to the filter.          

153
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,498
he places the motor and filter into the base canister      

154
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,969
and locks the assembly together with clips at the sides.     

155
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,241
the worker transfers the steam cleaner to a cart.   

156
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,315
once the vacuum is on board,   

157
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:56,054
this duo is ready to eradicate dirt, grease, and pathogens.   

158
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:02,794
just aim and pull the trigger.  

159
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,464
the steam will do the rest.   

160
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,152
narrator: a slice of pizza   
isn't always a portable snack.  

161
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,690
the toppings can slide off while you're eating it.     

162
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,695
these hand-held, individual pizzas solve that problem.    

163
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,299
the toppings are safely encased inside the pizza dough.     

164
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:48,573
hand-held pizzas are small enough for kids to easily hold.              

165
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,309
they're made without preservatives,      

166
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,711
and all the ingredients are organic,           

167
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:57,582
making them the perfect frozen snack for hungry children.    

168
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,052
one main ingredient is cauliflower.         

169
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,254
it packs a strong nutritional punch        

170
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,791
without altering the flavor.   

171
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,392
cauliflower is low in calories  

172
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,196
but high in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.        

173
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,266
it also helps thicken the filling.       

174
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,001
after removing the stems,    

175
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,471
the cooks boil the cauliflower heads until tender.             

176
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,140
they remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon       

177
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:26,411
to let the water drain away.   

178
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,715
they puree the cauliflower in a food processor.       

179
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,155
the cooks also boil and puree butternut squash,   

180
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,624
which is full of vitamin a, vitamin c,     

181
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,893
and many other nutrients.    

182
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,762
the squash puree slightly sweetens the filling  

183
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,166
and helps thicken it.      

184
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,234
other ingredients that go into the filling are   

185
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,572
tomato paste, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses,            

186
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:57,342
potato flakes, sea salt, spices, and water.        

187
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,780
after measuring out the required amounts,      

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,184
workers pour the ingredients into a large bowl.        

189
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,262
they manually blend the ingredients         

190
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,267
with a large whisk to keep the filling's texture coarse.  

191
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,873
the pizza dough is made with wheat flour,    

192
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,144
unbleached all-purpose flour, and baking soda.         

193
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,080
they also add palm fruit shortening      

194
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:39,617
and water to make the dough pliable.    

195
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,422
they combine all the ingredients in a mixer.           

196
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,426
the mixer blends the ingredients thoroughly            

197
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:50,162
until the dough         
reaches the right consistency.  

198
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,034
after mixing, they let the dough rest.     

199
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,478
next, they transform the blocks of dough into sheets.             

200
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,718
they place an 8-inch block of dough     

201
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,855
on a machine called the dough sheeter.    

202
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,390
the dough moves back and forth beneath a roller         

203
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,728
until it's flat.         

204
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,365
they add flour so the dough won't stick to the roller.    

205
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:36,007
a worker winds the sheet of dough onto a spool      

206
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,844
and transfers it to the processing line.     

207
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,683
here, four rotary blades trim the sides          

208
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,420
and divide the sheet into three strips.        

209
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,289
spray nozzles lightly mist the dough with water       

210
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,691
to keep it pliable.       

211
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,295
a machine dispenses the filling at perfectly timed intervals.  

212
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,564
it adds one ounce of filling per pizza       

213
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,234
to one side of each strip.    

214
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:07,239
then the machine folds the other side over.    

215
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:11,843
a crimping wheel seals the edge to encase the filling.      

216
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,111
they add more flour on top so the crimper          

217
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,849
and rotary cutters can easily trim off the excess dough.    

218
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,989
a chopping blade separates the filled dough    

219
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,792
into individual pizzas.     

220
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:32,797
then the crimper seals the third edge.      

221
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,801
workers transfer the pizzas by hand onto baking sheets.   

222
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,372
they're lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking.    

223
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,812
then they bake the pizzas in an oven.           

224
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,349
as soon as they come out, they're flash-frozen.      

225
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,155
this rapid deep-freeze locks in the nutrients      

226
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,225
and makes preservatives unnecessary.           

227
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,628
the frozen pizzas go straight to the packaging room.              

228
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,098
it's refrigerated so the pizzas won't begin to thaw.       

229
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,968
the equipment individually wraps the pizzas in plastic   

230
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,773
then packages them, two per box.              

231
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,109
after 60 seconds in the microwave,        

232
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,379
these pizzas are ready to eat.  

233
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,781
the thick filling doesn't drip,              

234
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,618
making them the perfect meal on the go.   

235
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,803
narrator: wire power brushes rotate  a 

236
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,405
without damaging it.       

237
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,741
these industrial tools     
can scrub off almost anything,  

238
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,412
including weld splatter, rust, and paint.         

239
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,548
they can also smooth away sharp edges           

240
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,050
and protrusions known as burrs.             

241
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:07,058
wire power brushes come in many different shapes and sizes.             

242
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,163
the bristles are either knotted or crimped.       

243
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:17,769
there's a wire power brush for every metal-cleaning job.  

244
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,572
automated tools work with pinpoint accuracy   

245
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:24,508
to create a wire brush with knotted bristles.      

246
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,779
a tool inserts 22 wires into each hole of the steel disk.   

247
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:32,317
the wires are made of high-carbon steel.      

248
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,390
another tool twists the wire bundle into a knot.   

249
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,726
it makes a special knot     

250
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,896
designed for maximum strength and durability.         

251
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,770
the system installs 48 knotted wire bundles in each brush.   

252
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,408
an employee transfers the brush to a machine           

253
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,743
with circular blades.      

254
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,447
the blades trim the wires down and sharpen the ends.      

255
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,420
the next worker sandwiches    

256
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,824
the brush's center disk between two larger disks.    

257
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:16,628
a press welder creates three dimples in the metal.   

258
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,434
these dimples tightly hold the brush structure in place.  

259
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,970
a press drives a large nut into the center hole.      

260
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,974
it will be used to securely attach the wire brush      

261
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,108
to a power tool.         

262
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,313
this completes the knotted wire power brush assembly.      

263
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,116
next, they make the crimped wire brush.     

264
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,519
first, a device feeds steel wire              

265
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,989
to a cutting machine in preset increments.      

266
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,258
the machine's cutting wheels slice the wires         

267
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,094
to the correct length.      

268
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,264
it deposits the wire bundles on a rack,            

269
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,700
and a worker collects them.   

270
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,473
then, another worker threads a long wire       

271
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,577
between two metal flanges and a winding machine.      

272
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,620
she lines up the pins around the flanges.       

273
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:21,226
then she tucks freshly-cut wire bundles into those slots.    

274
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,828
she continues until she's stacked the wire bundles     

275
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,164
all the way around the flanges.            

276
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,170
then she starts the machine.   

277
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:36,040
it winds the long wire around the shorter wire bundles.            

278
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,909
this crimps the short wires at the center          

279
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,712
and holds them in place between the flanges.       

280
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,448
she pulls the end of the wire  

281
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,250
to the side of the brush segment.      

282
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,120
then it's ready for the next operation.     

283
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,324
a 100-ton press         

284
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,060
bends the flanges over the crimped bristles,    

285
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:59,497
encasing the longer wire that holds them together.    

286
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,802
next, a worker          

287
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,440
spins the ends of the brush between two circular blades.   

288
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,813
this is a preliminary trimming.            

289
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,584
then a punch enlarges the diameter of the center hole.              

290
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,292
next, they combine several of the crimped brush segments  

291
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,561
together.            

292
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,830
an employee piles up the segments.      

293
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,499
he places a tube in the center and spacers    

294
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,235
in between the brushes.     

295
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,104
once the brush reaches the right size,     

296
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,973
he uses a compression tool    

297
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,110
to curl the tube's top rim against the flange.       

298
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,250
this secures the segments, creating one large crimped wire              

299
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:57,922
brush.              

300
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,326
then he trims the wire bristles to the correct length.      

301
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,069
when attached to a power tool, knotted bristle wire brushes   

302
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:16,274
can spin up to 25,000 rotations per minute.             

303
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,611
the brush's high speed     
allows it to efficiently scrub  

304
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,147
dirt and grease from an oil-well drill pipe.   

305
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,217
the crimped wire brush is designed for lighter work,  

306
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,087
like scrubbing rust off a metal pipe.        

307
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,892
these power brushes       

308
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:38,663
are bristling with cleaning potential and ready for work.
