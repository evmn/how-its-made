00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,157
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,093
brushes and push brooms...   

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,566
...blackboards...       

6
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,271
...smoked salmon...      

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,711
...and zippers.        

8
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,122
nothing scrubs or sweeps quite like a good, sturdy brush.   

9
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,591
cleaning brushes in north america        

10
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,127
date back to about the 1830s. 

11
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,931
their bristles were usually made
of wire twisted into wood.   

12
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,800
today we have many different bristle materials,       

13
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,970
both natural and synthetic.  

14
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,476
the first factory manufactures the brush block --       

15
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,480
the hardwood base that holds the bristles.    

16
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:26,218
it's usually made of maple, but sometimes oak or beech.  

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,087
after cutting the planks to the required width,     

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,689
they use a special wax crayon to mark lines         

19
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:36,295
on both sides of any cracks or knots in the wood.     

20
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,896
a laser then reads the marks, 

21
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,765
guiding a saw to cut out the faults.     

22
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,367
at the same time,       

23
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,304
the saw chops the planks into block-size lengths.    

24
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,573
the next step is called "molding."      

25
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,909
a series of saws trims the blocks        

26
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,113
to the required thickness.   

27
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,248
now they contour the pieces,  

28
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,052
using a machine appropriately called a shaper.        

29
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,853
the machine revolves,     

30
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,591
running the block's outside edge
against a cutting head.    

31
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,560
this profiles half the block. 

32
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,731
workers then turn it around  

33
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,934
and line it up for a second pass       

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,069
to profile the other half.   

35
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,607
there's a different shaper machine for each model.    

36
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,943
this type is known as a dauber --         

37
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,479
a brush for waxing shoes.   

38
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,355
for the cuts to be accurate and smooth,          

39
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,090
it's essential that the machine's cutting heads  

40
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,427
remain sharp despite repeated use.     

41
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,696
that's why they're made of carbide,          

42
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,266
a material stronger than steel.

43
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,976
workers run certain models against an extra cutting head 

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,578
to carve a groove in the block's edges.     

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,416
the groove gives your hand a better grip on the brush.  

46
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:12,257
these 2 1/2x24" blocks will become push brooms --   

47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,859
those wide, rectangular brooms 

48
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,263
janitors use to sweep floors. 

49
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,532
the blocks go to an automated machine    

50
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,801
that drills a hole through the middle       

51
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,737
and carves two grooves in the underside.       

52
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,538
these are for the steel adapter

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,908
that will hold the broom's wooden handle.         

54
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,282
rounded push brooms sweep more easily in corners. 

55
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,483
to produce those,       

56
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,552
workers take the rectangular push broom blocks       

57
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,389
and round the corners against a cutting head.    

58
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,564
at another factory, the blocks go onto a machine  

59
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,900
that pierces holes for the bristles,        

60
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,535
using a computer-guided drill. 

61
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,241
this particular model of push broom needs 240 holes. 

62
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,778
it takes barely a minute to drill them all.       

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,623
next, the blocks go to the bristle-installation machine. 

64
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,528
bristles can be made of horsehair, vinyl,      

65
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,330
plants or tree leaves,     

66
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,834
or synthetics such as polypropylene.     

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,475
the bristle-installation machine
is fully automated,      

68
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,010
as we see here in slow motion. 

69
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,947
it takes about 40 strands at a time, folds them in half, 

70
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,851
then inserts and staples them into a hole.          

71
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,710
here's what that bristling action looks like  

72
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,245
at actual speed.        

73
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,449
the machine fills four holes per second.          

74
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,792
the factory uses this same process       

75
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:31,262
regardless of the style of brush
block or type of bristle.   

76
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,732
computer software guides the machinery      

77
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,666
to follow the correct pattern, 

78
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,505
making possible a sweeping array
of brushes and brooms.     

79
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,349
narrator: chalk one up for the blackboard.      

80
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,418
this trusted teaching tool goes back centuries,      

81
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,955
yet still remains the focal point of the classroom.    

82
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,423
today's blackboard --     

83
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,026
or chalkboard, as it's also called --     

84
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,828
hasn't changed that much in appearance,         

85
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,865
but the materials used to make it have changed. 

86
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,971
our lesson begins at the blackboard factory,   

87
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,107
with thin sheets of galvanized steel.      

88
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,243
these will eventually form   

89
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,712
the front and back surfaces of the blackboard.       

90
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,914
they arrive at the factory   

91
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,050
already precut to standard sizes --      

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,187
6, 8, 10, or 12 feet.     

93
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,258
first stop is a machine that blasts the sheets with acid.  

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,393
this removes any dirt     

95
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,997
that would prevent paint from adhering to the surface. 

96
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:44,403
as the sheets exit the cleaner,
powerful fans dry them off.  

97
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,805
the paint is a type of acrylic enamel       

98
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,875
designed especially for blackboards.        

99
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,744
the factory adds a powdered mineral formulation 

100
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,814
to make it dry to a rougher texture.     

101
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,283
this helps chalk adhere better.

102
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,088
traditional slate blackboards were naturally black.     

103
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,025
today's steel-surface boards come in several colors.    

104
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,762
the most popular, though, are black and green.      

105
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,099
some companies use colored porcelain instead of paint.  

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,035
here, spray guns apply three coats of paint,      

107
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,105
one after another,       

108
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,507
with no drying time in between.

109
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,912
for the paint to harden    
properly, it has to be heat-set,

110
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,513
so the sheets go into an oven 

111
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,317
at 420 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes.        

112
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,221
a strong fan cools them off as they exit the oven.     

113
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,659
next, a worker sprays contact cement     

114
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,329
on the backs of two painted sheets.     

115
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,802
one sheet will form the front of the board,    

116
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,604
the other, the back.      

117
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,405
sandwiched in between     

118
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,143
will be what's known as the blackboard's core.   

119
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,145
it can be made of materials such as particleboard     

120
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,016
or, as we see here, 1/2-inch-thick fiberboard.   

121
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,089
workers feed the three assembled layers   

122
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,158
through a high-pressure roller.

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,898
it forces out any trapped air and bonds the layers tightly. 

124
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,832
they make the blackboard's frame

125
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,235
out of one long strip of aluminum molding.      

126
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,872
it has a stainproof satin finish.         

127
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,978
they make a series of 45-degree-angle cuts.    

128
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,515
this enables them to bend the strip       

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,050
around the board's perimeter, 

130
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,918
creating neat corner seams.  

131
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,588
workers file down and polish  

132
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,391
any sharp edges left by the cutting.      

133
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,197
after verifying that it's perfectly square,     

134
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,732
they fasten the frame,     

135
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:58,135
using either rivets or screws, depending on the model.    

136
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,539
then, they attach an aluminum rail along the bottom     

137
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,909
to hold the chalk and erasers. 

138
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,746
this model happens to be    

139
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,015
a reversible mobile blackboard --      

140
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,817
the type typically rolled into conference rooms.     

141
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,687
it has a few extra components --
a pivot mechanism,       

142
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,292
enabling the board to be flipped
to the other side...      

143
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,960
and a latch system       

144
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,829
for tilting the board to different angles.      

145
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,970
the blackboard stand is made of painted steel tubing.    

146
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:37,108
it rolls on rubber-      
and chrome-plated steel castors.

147
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,711
the factory takes samples from the production line    

148
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,848
and subjects them to rigorous quality-control testing.    

149
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,516
these tests ensure       

150
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,853
that the painted surface is glare-free         

151
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,389
and can withstand everything from chemical solvents     

152
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,124
and extreme humidity      

153
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,593
to heavy impact and hard scratches.      

154
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,930
the company has even designed this special machine      

155
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,801
to conduct a killer durability test.        

156
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,072
it applies 100,000 chalk and brush strokes,    

157
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,209
using the typical amount of pressure a person would use.

158
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,278
for the production batch to make it to market,     

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,147
surface wear on the sample   

160
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,952
has to amount to less than 1/100 of a millimeter.     

161
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,621
and that's not all.      

162
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,956
the paint finish must still be matte.      

163
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,560
a writing test has to produce chalk lines   

164
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,229
that are clear and dark enough,

165
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,799
and the writing has to erase cleanly and easily.      

166
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,176
narrator: for thousands of years,    

167
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,445
smoked fish was a survival food.

168
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,514
people would cure their catches

169
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,250
by salting them and hanging them to dry    

170
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,320
or by smoking them over an open fire.       

171
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,588
this enabled people in cold climates        

172
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,527
to stockpile nutrient-rich fish
for those long winter months. 

173
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,336
today we smoke fish primarily to enhance its flavor.     

174
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,873
this is wild sockeye salmon  

175
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,609
that was gutted and frozen on board the fishing trawler  

176
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,878
to preserve maximum freshness. 

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,747
the smokehouse defrosts the fish

178
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,749
for over 15 hours in running water        

179
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,285
that's just 2 degrees above freezing.        

180
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,689
this slow, cold water thaw   

181
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,958
helps prevent bacteria from forming.         

182
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,628
next step, filleting.     

183
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,230
first, they slice off what's known as the collar -- 

184
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,566
the fish version of a neck.  

185
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,769
then, they cut each fish in half
lengthwise,          

186
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,237
separating two fillets     

187
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,305
from what's called the control bone --      

188
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,709
the fish equivalent of a spinal column.      

189
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,278
the tail is attached to it.  

190
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,315
they feed the control bones into a machine         

191
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,486
that strips off any remaining scraps of flesh.   

192
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,592
the machine grinds these bits into minced salmon,      

193
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,128
which is used to make salmon pie.          

194
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,732
they trim the fillets using a razor-sharp knife,   

195
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,269
slicing off the fins, any excess fat,        

196
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,739
and any control-bone fragments left behind.          

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,943
after this, the fish will be ready for curing --      

198
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:30,014
a preservation process that also enhances taste.   

199
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:34,552
workers coat the fillets in  
a mixture of salt and 26 spices,

200
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:38,022
then let them sit for roughly an hour and a half.      

201
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,291
this short cure time      

202
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,896
will limit the salmon's salt content to less than 1%. 

203
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,831
to stop the curing process,  

204
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,901
they rinse off the coating with cold water,        

205
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,837
then glaze the fillets with maple syrup        

206
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,907
to neutralize any remaining salt residue.  

207
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,108
some companies use a less costly mix     

208
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,479
of boiled water and brown sugar.

209
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,185
the fillets go into a huge smoke oven.       

210
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,921
workers load its combustion chamber with sawdust --    

211
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:15,126
maple-tree sawdust for the first 8 hours of smoking, 

212
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,795
cherry-tree sawdust for the next 8 hours,     

213
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,199
and apple-tree sawdust for the last 8 hours.      

214
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,134
this particular sequence    

215
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,871
is a major factor in flavoring the fish.     

216
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:31,208
they douse the fire with water to generate smoke.       

217
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,745
this process is called "cold smoking,"   

218
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,415
because the oven temperature is 50 degrees fahrenheit --   

219
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:42,554
significantly lower than    
the industry norm of 77 degrees.

220
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,889
smoking at this lower temperature       

221
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,425
takes at least 24 hours -- 3 times longer than the norm --

222
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,130
but the company says it produces a moister product. 

223
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,568
when the fillets come out of the smoke oven,  

224
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,170
they're thoroughly cooked   

225
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,340
but still have the consistency of raw fish.          

226
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,778
workers remove the fin bones --
40 fin bones per fillet --   

227
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,381
located between the head and fin.       

228
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,456
the fillets then go through a skinning machine,      

229
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:23,494
which neatly slices off the skin
without removing any flesh.  

230
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,738
then, it's into a freezer at 27 degrees fahrenheit.   

231
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,610
this firms up the fillets, making them easier to slice.  

232
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,550
the manual slicing machines cut them into pieces      

233
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,352
about 1/10 of an inch thick.  

234
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,560
workers weigh out the amount they're packaging --      

235
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,897
in this case, 2 1/2 ounces.  

236
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,302
they place each portion on a tray           

237
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,638
made of aluminum-coated cardboard.           

238
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,974
aluminum blocks the fat from seeping through.     

239
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,576
to kill off any remaining bacterial,    

240
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,645
they vacuum-pack the wrappers, 

241
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,981
then deep-freeze them for about an hour       

242
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:20,451
at negative-31 degrees fahrenheit.      

243
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,588
they store and ship at a milder zero degrees --  

244
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,457
the temperature of your home freezer --    

245
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,726
where this preservative-free smoked salmon         

246
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,796
stays fresh for a full year.  

247
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,739
narrator: zippers can be found on clothing,   

248
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,409
on bags, even on footwear.   

249
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:48,079
the zipper started out as a closure mechanism for boots 

250
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,547
and tobacco pouches.      

251
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,483
the fashion industry didn't put them on clothing  

252
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,284
until the 1930s --       

253
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,487
some 80 years after the invention      

254
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,356
of this fabulous fastener.   

255
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,465
an american, elias howe, was the first to patent     

256
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,568
a zipperlike clothing fastener in 1851,            

257
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,237
but he never ended up marketing it.         

258
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,306
it wasn't until 1893 that another american,     

259
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,243
whitcomb judson, designed a similar device,   

260
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,047
called a clasp locker.     

261
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,985
he eventually hired a canadian engineer, gideon sundback,   

262
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:30,054
to simplify the original complex design,        

263
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,523
which had never really taken off.           

264
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:37,628
in 1917, judson and sundback patented the modern zipper.   

265
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,008
zipper teeth are made of metal,
plastic, or nylon.       

266
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,944
the fabric part of the zipper is called the tape.      

267
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,546
it's usually polyester,    

268
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,348
but sometimes cotton or fireproof fabric.      

269
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,750
to make metal zippers,     

270
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,087
the factory feeds a long, continuous roll of tape    

271
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,556
into what's called the teeth machine,       

272
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,159
along with a long roll of metal
ribbon known as "flat wire."  

273
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,098
as we see here in slow motion, 

274
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,702
the machine cuts off a tiny piece of flat wire,   

275
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,973
forces it through a die that forms into a tooth shape, 

276
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:26,511
then clamps it onto the edge of one side of the tape.    

277
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:31,649
the machine does all this at a rate of 45 teeth per second. 

278
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,985
these zipper teeth are aluminum.

279
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,855
sturdier zippers are made of stronger metals  

280
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,657
like brass and nickel.     

281
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,392
depending on the model,    

282
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,994
teeth can range in width    

283
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:46,530
from about 1/10 of an inch to 4/10 of an inch.      

284
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,400
the wider the teeth, the thicker they have to be.  

285
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,936
workers now feed two tapes with metal teeth        

286
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,404
into what's called the joining machine.      

287
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,873
the teeth interlock,      

288
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,677
meshing the two halves of what's
now a continuous zipper.    

289
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,480
from there, it's into a cleaning machine,      

290
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,148
which washes the zipper,    

291
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,884
removing any shards of metal left behind          

292
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,954
by the tooth-cutting process. 

293
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,488
after drying the zipper,    

294
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,158
the machine applies a coat of hot wax.       

295
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,826
this lubricates the teeth   

296
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,964
so the slider will glide over them smoothly.      

297
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,966
next stop is the gapping machine.    

298
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:26,170
it removes a 2-inch-long section
of teeth at regular intervals. 

299
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,240
they'll later cut the tape at these gaps,         

300
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,478
dividing the continuous zipper into several shorter zippers.  

301
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,915
there are two main types of zippers.          

302
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,717
closed-end zippers are the kind

303
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,853
whose two halves don't separate
at the bottom when opened --  

304
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,056
purse zippers, for example.  

305
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,992
these need a part called a bottom stop --    

306
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,727
a thick piece of flat wire   

307
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,329
positioned at the base of the zipper.         

308
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,332
when you unzip, it stops the slider      

309
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:58,135
and prevents the two halves from separating.        

310
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,870
open-end zippers are the kind 

311
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,073
whose two halves<i> do</i> separate at the bottom when opened --  

312
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,209
jacket zippers, for instance. 

313
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,944
at the bottom of these zippers,

314
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,680
a machine applies a clear reinforcement strip.  

315
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,281
this stiffens the tape     

316
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,286
so that the next machine can apply the pin and box.   

317
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,358
the pin is that vertical piece of metal            

318
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,826
on one half of the zipper   

319
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,161
that you have to align in the box on the other half  

320
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,098
before you can pull the slider to zip up.           

321
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,418
the next machine installs the slider.      

322
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,797
watch in slow motion as it opens each gap      

323
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,035
and hooks a slider onto the track of teeth.    

324
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,608
the next machine inserts what's called the top stop -- 

325
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,877
a thick piece of flat wire   

326
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,212
that stops the slider at the top of the track    

327
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,548
when you zip up all the way.  

328
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,618
the machine then slices the tape
at each gap,          

329
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,154
separating the finished zippers.

330
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,759
plastic zippers are made quite differently than metal ones.  

331
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,628
the tape is the same,     

332
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,564
but the teeth are made from plastic pellets.      

333
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,166
a machine melts them,     

334
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,701
then injects the liquid plastic
into a mold          

335
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,071
that's the shape of a strip of zipper teeth.        

336
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,710
the mold cools almost instantly,
hardening the plastic.     

337
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,045
the machine then stamps the teeth onto the tape,    

338
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,847
automatically gapping the desired zipper length   

339
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,717
at the same time.       

340
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,387
the excess plastic in the middle
is remelted.          

341
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,922
there's no joining machine   

342
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,525
to mesh the two halves of plastic zippers.      

343
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,194
workers do this manually    

344
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,529
so that they can inspect the plastic teeth       

345
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,132
to make sure they're well formed.      

346
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,936
then, automated machines install
the remaining components.
