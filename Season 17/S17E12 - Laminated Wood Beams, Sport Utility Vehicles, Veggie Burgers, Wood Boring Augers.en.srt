00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,454
narrator: in architectural design,    

4
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,655
exposed wood beams       

5
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,058
use the structural components of a building         

6
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,326
in an aesthetic way.      

7
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,596
these beams are often made of glued laminated timbers.  

8
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:04,930
they're constructed      

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,533
by gluing together several layers of lumber    

10
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,002
and forming them into a particular shape    

11
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,938
such as a curved arch.     

12
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:19,145
these beams look as though they're a solid piece of wood. 

13
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,080
however, they're actually laminated wood --       

14
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,685
several boards of lumber glued together to form one piece.  

15
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,020
the boards aren't layered haphazardly.  

16
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:31,157
rather, the top-grade wood goes on the top and bottom,  

17
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,692
where the beam must be the most resistant,  

18
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,228
and lower-grade wood in the middle.         

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,231
the boards are far shorter than the finished beam,    

20
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,166
therefore the first step    

21
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,036
is to extend each layer to the required length     

22
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,039
by connecting several boards end to end.          

23
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,241
to do this, a conveyor system 

24
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:52,177
transports 10 boards at a time to a mill.           

25
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,847
saw blades trim the edges to make them perfectly square, 

26
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,051
then revolving knives cut finger joints on both ends.

27
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,596
when it comes time to connect the boards horizontally,    

28
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,399
the finger joints of one board 

29
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,801
will fit neatly into those of the next.    

30
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,805
the comb-like shape of the finger joints      

31
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,207
creates a far greater service area to glue      

32
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,144
compared to leaving the edges flat.        

33
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,381
more glue makes for a stronger bond between boards.

34
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:33,351
the glue is high-strength and waterproof.        

35
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,489
it goes on brown but dries translucent.     

36
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,160
workers line up the glued boards
in a machine called a crowder. 

37
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,764
the machine's pressure rollers slide one board into the other,

38
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:46,999
interlocking the finger joints.

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,171
then two plates clamp down on each joint,         

40
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,840
rendering the adjoining boards flush   

41
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,310
should one be sitting slightly higher than the next. 

42
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,714
about 15 seconds of heat cures the glue.        

43
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,519
the connection is barely visible

44
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,755
because the glue dries translucent.       

45
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,060
now that each layer is the required length,    

46
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,531
it's time to adhere them vertically to make the beam.  

47
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,367
first, a glue applicator coats one side.        

48
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,339
then workers turn the layers on their sides 

49
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,209
and stack them in a steel frame
called a jig.         

50
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,012
once they've stacked      

51
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,216
the required number of layers for the beam,         

52
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,018
they activate high-strength steel pressure vices.     

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,955
these apply high pressure for six to eight hours     

54
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:46,125
until the glue between the layers has cured. 

55
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,764
to make an arched beam, it's the same process,     

56
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,102
but they stack then clamp the layers in a curved jig.  

57
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,853
once the glue cures,      

58
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:18,424
this laminated wood beam is stronger than solid wood.  

59
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,735
however, there are still several more steps to go.   

60
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:32,938
a two-sided planer       

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,941
simultaneously finalizes the dimensions,        

62
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,811
evens out the ends, and removes excess glue    

63
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:41,480
that oozed out under pressure. 

64
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:54,093
next, a computer-guided, multi-tool machine       

65
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,761
cuts, drills, and notches the beam      

66
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,096
according to the customer's  

67
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,999
technical drawing specifications.        

68
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,638
then each beam gets a tag   

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,508
indicating the order number and part number.        

70
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,311
in the final finishing department,     

71
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,547
workers sand away any visual defects       

72
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,551
and smooth the surface in preparation for staining.  

73
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,991
finishers apply one coat of wood stain with a roller,  

74
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,126
then work it by hand      

75
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:32,198
to ensure uniform absorption throughout.          

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
once the beam is shipped to the
construction site,       

77
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,402
the customer might apply a flameproof coating,     

78
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,204
which would significantly slow down           

79
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,073
the rate at which the beam would burn      

80
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,674
in the event of a fire.    

81
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,811
the customer may also stain it a deeper shade         

82
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,214
to match existing woodwork.  

83
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,498
narrator: the four-wheel drive utility vehicle        

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,434
was originally designed for war.

85
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,834
it was world war ii,      

86
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,439
and the american-made military 
jeep quickly earned its stripes,

87
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:16,442
plowing through mud and muck on the road to victory.    

88
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,644
today's s.u.v.s are modern versions      

89
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,714
and proof that the concept has transitioned nicely    

90
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,549
into civilian life.      

91
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,722
when the road ahead is rough or disappears entirely,    

92
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,092
a four-wheel drive utility vehicle keeps on going.

93
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,266
production of this custom s.u.v.
begins with a mandrel bent frame

94
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,535
made of thick steel rails.   

95
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,938
a worker welds brackets to it for attaching parts --     

96
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,075
this one for its shock absorber's nitrogen tank.

97
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:58,017
he attaches a link for the sway bar and suspension arms. 

98
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:01,286
he then welds super-thick braces for shocks 

99
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,956
to the front of the chassis.  

100
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,024
he measures the space between them     

101
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,427
to confirm that there's adequate clearance

102
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,562
and then fits heavy-duty calipers      

103
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,365
over the brake rotors installed at the front.    

104
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,101
the front brakes are a six-piston system    

105
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,970
for extra stopping power.   

106
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,239
he now fits the coil-wrapped shock absorbers        

107
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,375
to the front axle and bolts them to the braces  

108
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,044
we saw welded to the chassis earlier.    

109
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,180
this is a preliminary installation.         

110
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:32,051
the parts will all be tightened
more precisely later.     

111
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,920
it's time to give this custom s.u.v.       

112
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,256
some supersized wheels.    

113
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,125
he positions the rims     

114
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,994
on threaded bolts protruding from the axles   

115
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:48,067
and then secures the installation with lug nuts.  

116
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,802
the tires are eight-ply with deep tread        

117
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,972
for off-road traction.     

118
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,012
this s.u.v. chassis is ready for power.      

119
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,213
the team wheels the chassis  

120
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,083
under the eight-cylinder drivetrain           

121
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,217
and carefully lowers it into position.         

122
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,490
this powerful engine will generate a lot of heat,  

123
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,893
so it needs a large capacity radiator to keep cool 

124
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:20,165
and prevent damage to the engine.         

125
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:24,036
once the steel chassis has been
coated with a protective finish

126
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,105
and the fuel system has been installed,      

127
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,307
production shifts to the next stage --      

128
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,776
piecing together the s.u.v. body.        

129
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,313
this pre-assembly will ensure 

130
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,717
all the aluminum parts fit together flawlessly.    

131
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,185
after this, the s.u.v.     

132
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,921
will be completely taken apart for painting          

133
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,225
and then put back together again.    

134
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:52,197
he hinges the doors to the body
with thick steel pins     

135
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,801
that hold up to wear and make the assembly easy.  

136
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,674
he attaches each window frame to the lower door panel    

137
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,143
and checks the fit.      

138
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:08,747
any gaps could allow the wind to whistle into the vehicle.  

139
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,484
he confirms the parts align and that the door latch works. 

140
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,888
he bolts the steel roll bars to the s.u.v. body.      

141
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,557
once he's satisfied that the framework       

142
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,794
meets all the specifications, he'll take it apart.      

143
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,900
the paint is a powder-coat finish.    

144
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,502
it's ionically charged, so it gravitates        

145
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,839
to the negatively charged parts
as it's sprayed.        

146
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,307
once baked in an oven,     

147
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,078
the coating forms a skin that's 
tougher than conventional paint.

148
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,517
they also coat the underside of the lower parts       

149
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,319
with a heat-cured finish    

150
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,122
to reduce wear and to muffle vibration.    

151
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:53,725
they now piece together the lower body of the s.u.v.  

152
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,993
and assemble the dashboard   

153
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,929
and the instrument panel to the front.         

154
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,404
they bolt the seats to the floor,         

155
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,805
and once other parts have been welded to it,    

156
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,476
they lower the assembly onto the chassis.       

157
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:15,147
the chassis has, by now, been completely wired.     

158
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,083
the parts mate perfectly.   

159
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,824
it takes about 250 person hours

160
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,560
to build one of these custom s.u.v.s.  

161
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,563
we've shown just the highlights.

162
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,899
when it's complete, they test everything      

163
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,903
from the sensor-activated step to the windshield wipers.   

164
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,307
once they confirm that all systems are operational,  

165
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,379
this s.u.v. is ready to hit the back roads.

166
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,248
high off the ground with four-wheel drive,     

167
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,917
it's equipped for whatever lies ahead,    

168
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,420
and there's sure to be a few bumps along the way.   

169
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,076
narrator: craving a burger but yearning for a change?   

170
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,546
the veggie burger is a lower-fat alternative   

171
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,146
to the beefy favorite.     

172
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,548
just hold the fries.      

173
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,818
developed in the early 1980s in london, england,      

174
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,355
the veggie burger has gone from
fringe food to the mainstream 

175
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,691
all in short order.      

176
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,897
just add a bit of oil to the grill,         

177
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,967
and this meatless patty sizzles
with burger appeal.      

178
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,836
chock full of grains, nuts, and veggies,       

179
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,838
it somehow looks kind of beefy,

180
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
but it tastes distinctly different      

181
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,310
from an actual meat patty.   

182
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:53,979
this particular burger is a non-soy version,      

183
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,582
but there are many kinds of veggie burgers available today,

184
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,652
and an increasing number of people go meat-free     

185
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,121
or reduce the amount of meat they eat.           

186
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,524
they start with finely-minced frozen veggies.        

187
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:10,929
this recipe calls for carrots, celery, onions, and mushrooms. 

188
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,666
and that's safflower oil in the dish on the lower left. 

189
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,668
the safflower oil simmers on the bottom         

190
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,469
of this steam-heated mixer   

191
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,272
as they gradually add the ingredients.      

192
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,610
blades stir the mix as it sautés.         

193
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,278
as the vegetables cook,    

194
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,614
their natural sugars are released.         

195
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:32,083
this causes the veggies to caramelize.         

196
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,154
the flavors deepen and become more complex.    

197
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,957
this technique is called mirepoix.      

198
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,093
it's a french culinary term  

199
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,329
for a sautéed mix of aromatic vegetables.    

200
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,836
the mirepoix is very substantial

201
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:57,109
to add both texture and flavor to this veggie-burger recipe.  

202
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,178
they add the final ingredient, the mushrooms.         

203
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,581
and after more mixing and cooking,    

204
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,251
this veggie-burger mirepoix is complete.          

205
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,053
they transfer the mirepoix   

206
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,655
to a big mixing tub called the gondola.      

207
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,925
and now they add the dry ingredients.          

208
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:17,329
they include walnuts, cooked bulgur, oats,      

209
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:20,932
potato flakes, and pure gluten flour.     

210
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,272
the worker adds pails full of each of these ingredients   

211
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,440
to the mirepoix.        

212
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,743
then, using a shovel,     

213
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,946
he folds all the dry ingredients
into the mix.         

214
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,350
moistened by the cooked vegetables,   

215
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,752
the gluten flour becomes sticky.

216
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,089
this causes the ingredients to cling loosely together,   

217
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:48,626
taking on a consistency    
similar to that of cookie dough.

218
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,429
he now loads the sticky mix into a hopper         

219
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,566
that leads to an automatic patty-making machine.     

220
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,369
it's a mold with a plunger-like mechanism 

221
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,872
that presses and shapes the mixture into perfect patties. 

222
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:07,912
a constant spray of water keeps 
things from becoming too sticky,

223
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:12,250
allowing the patties to be cleanly ejected from the molds.

224
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,653
then it's a short conveyor trip
to the next station,      

225
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,456
where workers retrieve the veggie patties       

226
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,660
and arrange them on baking trays.        

227
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,796
in the process, they inspect the patties    

228
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,866
and confirm that they've been perfectly formed.     

229
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,935
they roll stack trays of burgers

230
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,670
into a preheated convection oven.        

231
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,606
when the oven door closes,   

232
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:39,344
the burger-ladened trays rotate
inside so they cook evenly.  

233
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:47,285
after baking, they quickly freeze the veggie burgers    

234
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,089
to lock in nutrients and preserve freshness.    

235
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,493
workers then load the frozen veggie burgers onto a conveyor 

236
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,062
as they head up into the packaging line.    

237
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:02,300
these burgers can't spend too much time outside the freezer, 

238
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,202
or they'll start to thaw.   

239
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,643
a hot iron seals the cellophane wrap   

240
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,111
around groups of four burgers 

241
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,480
and separates them into packets.

242
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,983
down the line,         

243
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,253
suctioning devices open cardboard boxes      

244
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,521
and transfer them to a conveyor.

245
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,859
the boxes are now positioned to receive the burger packets. 

246
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,065
as they move forward, workers just slide them inside.

247
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,138
the boxes of veggie burgers then head into a narrow lane  

248
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,108
to close the pre-glued flaps. 

249
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,748
this entire packaging operation
takes less than a minute.   

250
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,684
in just one hour, this factory can wrap and package      

251
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,954
more than 9,000 veggie burgers.

252
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,490
at the end of the day,     

253
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,426
that's a lot of meatless burgers,      

254
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,095
but it should be enough to feed a growing trend    

255
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,298
of vegetarianism.       

256
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,253
narrator: used for centuries to drill holes         

257
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,420
for pegs and bolts,      

258
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,589
augurs have played a bit role in history           

259
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,725
and were critical to the construction      

260
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,994
of everything from tall ships to manor homes.        

261
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,063
traditionally rotated by hand, 

262
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:43,435
today's power drills give the augur bit a more modern twist. 

263
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,674
attached to a power drill,   

264
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,811
an augur bit          
can chew through wood in seconds

265
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:54,812
to produce perfect screw holes.

266
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,416
it spits out shavings through the corkscrew-shaped pathway, 

267
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,753
preventing it from clogging the freshly-drilled holes.   

268
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,955
operated manually or by drill bit,        

269
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,624
the augur bit is an efficient gizmo     

270
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,360
responsible for a lot of projects coming together.  

271
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,630
an augur bit starts as a solid steel rod.     

272
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,967
they heat it to a blistering 1,600 degrees fahrenheit.   

273
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,838
when the rod is white-hot,   
it's supple enough to be shaped.

274
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,240
he moves one end of the hot steel rod      

275
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,242
under a long, pulsating hammer.

276
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,178
the anvils below allow the energy of the hammer    

277
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,381
to be transferred to the rod and flatten it.        

278
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,785
he angles the flattened end sideways to shape the edges.  

279
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,387
he then tweaks the profile a bit more           

280
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,057
by moving the rod from anvil to anvil.      

281
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,526
the anvils are set at various heights       

282
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,261
for impacts of different force.

283
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,730
when he's done, the once circular steel rod  

284
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:50,735
looks like a long putty knife, but this is just temporary.  

285
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,672
next, it's back into that super-hot furnace     

286
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,476
to reheat the forged end    
to a malleable state once again.

287
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,345
he clamps the white-hot rod in a machine          

288
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:05,483
that twists the flattened end to a specific configuration.  

289
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,619
in this hot and supple state, 

290
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,756
the steel is as easy to twist as a piece of stiff ribbon.  

291
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,959
as the steel cools, it becomes more rigid,     

292
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:19,097
so it's back into the furnace to make it pliable once again. 

293
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,300
he then places it between the jaws of a toothed vice.  

294
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,570
he closes the jaws repeatedly as he pulls the augur along.  

295
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,642
this crimps the augur's spirals
to a precise configuration.  

296
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,978
each spiral ends up exactly the same.       

297
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,313
it's a critical step.     

298
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,049
without it, the augur wouldn't operate smoothly   

299
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,586
and could even get stuck as it drills through wood.   

300
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:45,790
now he slams a drop hammer onto 
the tip of the augur repeatedly,

301
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,126
forcing it into a dye.     

302
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,395
as the hot steel fills the dye cavity,     

303
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,796
it takes its shape,      

304
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,400
giving it the rudimentary profile of the drilling head. 

305
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,004
it's now tapered like a cone, 

306
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,274
but there's a lot of surplus material surrounding it.    

307
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,144
this surplus steel is a bit of spillover.     

308
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,150
he trims off that hardened spillover with a clip press,  

309
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:16,421
and this further defines the drilling head.       

310
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:20,624
he presses the augur tip against a ridged grinding wheel

311
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,162
to carve a screw thread into it.

312
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:28,967
the screw thread will give the augur bit extra bite    

313
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,169
as it drills through wood.   

314
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:36,441
the focus now turns to the other
end of the augur, the shank.  

315
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,309
as it spins in a lathe,    

316
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,578
cutting tools slim the shank  

317
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,781
and shorten it to precise specifications.   

318
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:47,252
now they toughen up the steel by first heating it      

319
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,320
and then dipping it in cool oil.

320
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,123
the shock caused by the abrupt temperature change 

321
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,525
makes the steel harder.    

322
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,463
then the augur spins between two wheels.       

323
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,064
one wheel rolls it.      

324
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,600
the other grinds the outer diameter of the twist

325
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,068
to specification.       

326
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,139
a worker grinds the valleys in the augur twist by hand   

327
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,142
in order to reach every spot. 

328
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,676
this smoothes the surface   

329
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,746
so wood shavings will flow upward        

330
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,449
as the augur bores deep into the wood.         

331
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,222
he changes the belt to a finer abrasive      

332
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,423
and preps it with a small stone.

333
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:30,295
he spins the belt and polishes the augur until it shines.   

334
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:33,631
and the result is a glossy sheen.       

335
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,434
it looks good and will further smooth the way

336
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,704
for the extraction of wood shavings through the twists.  

337
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,307
now with a different and much smaller grinder,   

338
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,244
he carves wings and sharp edges
below the augur's cutting head.

339
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,849
from a simple steel cylinder to a useful wood-drilling bit, 

340
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:56,120
this has truly been a story with many twists and turns.  

341
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,457
and with the work of the factory
now done,           

342
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:03,861
these augurs are ready for any job.          

343
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,463
they come in a range of diameters and lengths    

344
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,767
for tasks of any size.     

345
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,672
with so many options,     

346
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:18,710
all those projects       
should come together bit by bit.

347
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,357
