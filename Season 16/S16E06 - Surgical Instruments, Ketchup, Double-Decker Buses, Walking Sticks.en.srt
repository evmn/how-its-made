00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,325
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,785
 narrator: surgical instruments 
          have evolved          

4
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,187
  with the science of medicine. 

5
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,523
     they actually date back    
       thousands of years,      

6
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,791
       when primitive man       
      used crude implements     

7
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,062
     to cut holes in skulls     
    to release evil spirits.    

8
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,998
         medical science        
 has come a long way since then,

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,302
   and today's surgical tools   
   are among its advancements.  

10
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,606
          in the hands          
      of a skilled surgeon,     

11
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,741
         the right tool         
       can be a lifesaver.      

12
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,010
     there are now hundreds     
         to choose from,        

13
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:22,147
        each designed for       
  a specific task or operation. 

14
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,082
 made of surgical-grade steel --

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,619
       which is extremely       
     corrosion-resistant --     

16
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:30,088
   they can withstand frequent  
    cleaning and sterilizing.   

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,692
  one of the more useful tools  
 is a self-retaining retractor, 

18
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,428
   which is used to pull back   
        tissues or organs       

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,030
         during surgery.        

20
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,831
    using a circular cutter,    

21
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,102
           they round           
the profile of the tool's joint.

22
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,638
        this round joint        
     allows the tool to open    

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,707
  when the shanks are shut, the 
 opposite of a pair of scissors.

24
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,644
    next, cutters carve slots   
          in two parts          

25
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,780
    to create the retractor's   
       intermeshing jaws.       

26
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,851
     these jaws will be used    
to grasp and retract body tissue

27
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,919
   so the surgeon can operate.  

28
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,657
  a technician sands the teeth  
     down to a precise size.    

29
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,427
   he must be accurate within   
   a quarter of a millimeter.   

30
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,466
he then smoothes the jaw's teeth
    against a fine-grit wheel   

31
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,536
   so they'll easily intermesh  
          when needed.          

32
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:21,140
 he rounds the tips of the teeth
       to make them blunt       

33
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,209
      so they won't damage      
          human tissue.         

34
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,478
         he hammers back        
     the tips of the teeth,     

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,980
giving them a claw-like profile.

36
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,951
  with the teeth now complete,  

37
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:35,154
 attention returns to the round 
    joint of the instrument.    

38
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,022
        the carved slots        
        and counter-sync        

39
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,159
       allow the two sides      
   to fit together perfectly.   

40
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,763
   they install a part called   
   the rack, below the joint,   

41
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,965
     and file teeth into it.    

42
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,301
it will be used to lock the tool
      in an open position.      

43
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,569
      after heat treatment,     

44
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,038
         a worker sands         
     all the tool components    

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,474
     to smooth sharp edges.     

46
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,981
    vibrating porcelain chips   
     and polishing compound     

47
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:06,452
   scrub them clean and remove  
   burrs caused by machining.   

48
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:10,056
  next, they install the pivot  
 screw and trigger for the rack.

49
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,390
         by pressing it,        

50
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:15,127
 the surgeon can open the prongs
      to the desired width      

51
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,663
 and lock the tool in position. 

52
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,601
      production now moves      
     to the surgical clamp.     

53
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,671
   it's used to block the flow  
   of blood during operations   

54
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,140
             and has            
  a more scissors-like joint -- 

55
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,409
  rectangular instead of round. 

56
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:34,880
       mechanized cutters       
  carve the joint and catches.  

57
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,748
 a worker forces the finger bows

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,951
             against            
    a spinning grinding wheel   

59
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,887
to remove surface imperfections.

60
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,224
  precision is again critical,  

61
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,094
      as the worker grinds      
    each of the tool's shanks   

62
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,629
    to the correct thickness.   

63
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,166
     he measures to confirm     
   that the size is consistent  

64
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,568
  along the length of the part. 

65
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,272
    he then files the joints    
    so they mate perfectly.     

66
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:07,112
   he places the joint part of  
one of the shanks over hot coals

67
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,515
       to soften the metal      
     and make it malleable.     

68
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,985
     then he forces a spike     
  through a slit in the joint,  

69
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:18,124
   and the now-compliant steel  
   stretches to open the slit.  

70
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,260
   the other shank now slides   
    easily into the opening.    

71
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,862
      he hammers the joint      
      to close the opening,     

72
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,265
        and the two arms        
     of this surgical clamp     

73
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,167
    are now hinged together.    

74
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,205
          next he files         
     the teeth of the clamp     

75
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,609
      so they'll interlock      
    when the tool is closed.    

76
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:42,614
      he bends the two ends     
          around a tool         

77
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,150
 to form the jaws of the clamp. 

78
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,619
       these curved jaws        
       will come in handy       

79
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,956
 when the surgeon needs to reach
     around organs or bone.     

80
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,159
 next, using a variety of tools,

81
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,562
           he adjusts           
 the shanks and the finger bows 

82
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,764
          to give them          
     a more ergonomic feel.     

83
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,368
   this is called soft-setting  
     because at this point,     

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,171
       the metal is still       
 soft enough to be manipulated. 

85
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,507
 he tweaks the bend of the jaws 

86
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,043
      until he's satisfied      
      with the curvature.       

87
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,314
           he smoothes          
  the inside of the finger bows 

88
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,383
   with a fine abrasive belt.   

89
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,051
      after heat treatment      
    to strengthen the metal,    

90
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,854
          they blast it         
    with fine glass particles   

91
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,657
   to give it a satin finish.   

92
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,260
they laser-etch the company name
     and identifying numbers    

93
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,862
    onto the surgical clamp.    

94
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,064
           the numbers          
will allow the tool to be traced

95
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,667
      back to a particular      
         production run.        

96
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,202
       and now it's ready       
       to take its place        

97
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,471
       on the front lines       
         of healthcare.         

98
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,422
            narrator:           
ketchup has a questionable past.

99
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,690
    according to one theory,    

100
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,160
    it comes from the chinese   
  "kê-chiap," a type of sauce.  

101
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:04,163
    another theory traces it    
  to european pickling sauces,  

102
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,365
         and yet another        
     claims arabic origins.     

103
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,434
but there's widespread agreement
     on where it ends up --     

104
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,838
    on hot dogs, hamburgers,    
        and french fries.       

105
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:19,244
     tomato ketchup recipes     
       vary only slightly,      

106
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,848
  as consumers expect a certain 
    familiar tomatoey taste.    

107
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,317
   this u.s. company produces   
       all-natural ketchup      

108
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,321
   made entirely of certified   
     organic ingredients --     

109
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:33,659
  tomato paste, agave nectar -- 
     a natural sweetener --     

110
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:38,230
      onion powder, spices,     
    salt, and white vinegar.    

111
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,400
        the tomato paste,       
        not surprisingly,       

112
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,136
     is the base ingredient.    

113
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,539
     it arrives at the plant    
          in huge bins,         

114
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,410
  which have been vacuum-packed 
     to preserve freshness.     

115
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,812
    after unsealing each bin,   

116
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,215
          the factory's         
   quality-control technician   

117
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:58,216
  scoops a sample for testing.  

118
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,219
    this is to make sure that   
  the thickness is just right.  

119
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,288
  if the sample gets the okay,  

120
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,359
   workers slide the bin under  
   a powerful air-driven pump.  

121
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,033
    then they flip a switch,    

122
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,769
          and the pump          
 begins moving the tomato paste 

123
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,304
    to a large holding tank,    

124
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,774
 transferring nearly 310 pounds 
      of this ketchup base      

125
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,877
    in less than 10 minutes.    

126
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,189
       at production time,      
  an intricate system of piping 

127
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:40,125
   transfers a specific amount  
         of tomato paste        

128
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,262
     from the holding tank      
     into a cooking kettle.     

129
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:47,532
       as the paste cooks,      
  a mixer continuously revolves 

130
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,868
           to keep it           
   from sticking to the sides   

131
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,739
and to blend in the onion powder
        workers add next.       

132
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,474
      this and the upcoming     
           ingredients          

133
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:56,875
     have been pre-measured     

134
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,778
   to be in correct proportion  
       to the batch size.       

135
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,415
 the next ingredients are salt, 

136
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,753
  then, as a sugar replacement, 
  nectar from the agave plant.  

137
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,222
 they pour in an initial amount,

138
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,625
           mix a bit,           
   then pump in the remainder.  

139
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,335
       the last ingredient      
        is white vinegar.       

140
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,241
    for competitive reasons,    
    the company won't divulge   

141
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,444
 the mixing time, cooking time, 
     or cooking temperature,    

142
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:37,683
  all of which are key elements 
   of this top-secret recipe.   

143
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,120
     on the packaging line,     

144
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,324
   an alignment machine stands  
   the plastic bottles upright  

145
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,861
     as they make their way     
     to the filling machine.    

146
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,930
the finished ketchup, meanwhile,
       is passing through       

147
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,601
 an elaborate system of cooling 
 pipes en route to the filler.  

148
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,870
   and let the bottling begin.  

149
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:04,843
        the machine fills       
   eight bottles at a time...   

150
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,748
   ...150 bottles per minute.   

151
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,691
  the factory tests every batch 
     of ketchup it produces     

152
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,961
      to ensure the correct     
  consistency in every bottle.  

153
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,302
        the next machine,       
appropriately called the capper,

154
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,238
    places a plastic flip-cap   
         on each bottle,        

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,010
  then, with spinning circular  
  belts, twists it on securely. 

156
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,115
        the next machine        

157
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,784
   cuts a decorative neck band  
      made of plastic film      

158
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,753
   and slips it over the cap.   

159
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,929
           each bottle          
  then passes under an air jet. 

160
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,866
             the air            
  blows the neck band downward  

161
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,869
      until it's positioned     
         under the cap.         

162
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:08,173
then a quick blast of hot steam 
shrinks the band to a tight fit.

163
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,815
   the next machine presses on  
     two adhesive labels --     

164
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,152
 one on the front of the bottle,
     the other on the back.     

165
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:24,355
        then it's off to        
 the packing-and-shipping area. 

166
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,093
   a sealed bottle of ketchup   
 stays fresh for at least a year

167
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,496
    because the vinegar in it   
 acts as a natural preservative.

168
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,565
ketchup also has health benefits

169
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,168
          because it's          
     chock full of tomatoes,    

170
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,171
  which are high in lycopene -- 
     a powerful antioxidant     

171
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,642
       believed to protect      
  against many types of cancer. 

172
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,524
  narrator: double-decker buses 
    have long been a fixture    

173
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,393
         on the streets         
       of london, england.      

174
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:02,794
     a typical double-decker    

175
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,397
     carries 60% more riders    
       than a regular bus.      

176
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,133
           and though           
    quintessentially british,   

177
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,336
      nowadays you'll find      
   london style double-deckers  

178
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:15,174
 on the streets of several major
  cities throughout the world.  

179
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,412
   every bus design undergoes   
   rigorous stability testing.  

180
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,814
     they fill the prototype    
        with lead weights       

181
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,284
           to simulate          
     a full passenger load,     

182
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,487
        then tips the bus       
      to a 28-degree angle,     

183
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:31,156
  the side wheels lifting about 
 shoulder height off the ground.

184
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,225
         if the vehicle         
       doesn't keel over,       

185
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:36,761
   the design passes the test.  

186
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,097
     the bus's underframe --    
         the chassis --         

187
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,500
    is made of welded steel.    

188
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,035
        they construct it       
  in three separate modules --  

189
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,903
   front, center, and rear --   

190
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,306
   then set the three modules   
       in an alignment jig      

191
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,042
     to be welded together.     

192
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,378
        once that's done,       
  welders add a steel structure 

193
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,848
   that'll support the floors,  
     seats, and body panels.    

194
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,052
 then they clean the chassis and
 paint it with anti-rust epoxy. 

195
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,787
   after baking on the paint,   

196
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,791
 they seal the gaps between the 
 welded parts with polyurethane.

197
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,860
this prevents water penetration,

198
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,529
        which would cause       
       internal corrosion.      

199
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,732
   meanwhile, technicians bolt  

200
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,935
         the 6-cylinder,        
      250-horsepower engine     

201
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,870
  to the automatic transmission 

202
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,274
 and connect the hydraulic lines
        and other piping.       

203
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:26,744
then they wheel this engine pack
    over to the assembly line   

204
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,081
      and bolt it to a bar      
   at the rear of the chassis.  

205
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,418
 by suspending the engine, they 
  shield it from impact damage  

206
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,088
          in the event          
    of a rear-end collision.    

207
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,592
 they also install the radiator,
 battery, and other components. 

208
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,498
  at the front of the chassis,  

209
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
          they install          
    the driver's binnacle --    

210
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,436
            on which            
  all the controls are located. 

211
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,572
       unlike a stationary      
         car dashboard,         

212
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:57,375
for driver comfort, the binnacle
tilts with the steering column. 

213
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,511
        after installing        
    the front and rear axles,   

214
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,381
  technicians mount the wheels. 

215
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:07,452
 each one is more than a yard in
 diameter and weighs 100 pounds.

216
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,987
      the engineering specs     

217
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,656
  require the wheel nuts to be  
 turned to a specific tightness.

218
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,592
      workers also install      
        the driver's seat       

219
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,529
        and the vehicle's       
       73-gallon gas tank.      

220
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,531
      the complete chassis      
 goes onto a test-drive machine 

221
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,001
         which simulates        
     varying passenger loads    

222
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,803
      and road conditions.      

223
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,338
a camera pointed at the binnacle

224
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,007
      records the accuracy      
       of the speedometer       

225
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,609
           and whether          
 any warning lights illuminate. 

226
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,411
 then it's in to the body shop, 

227
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,282
 where workers mount fiberglass 
     boxes over the wheels.     

228
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,017
          another team          
  builds the inter-deck floor,  

229
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,620
  the aluminum-frame structure  

230
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,889
         that separates         
      the bus's two levels.     

231
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:47,826
  they affix the lower level's  
  melamine ceiling to one side  

232
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,029
      and the upper deck's      
   plywood floor to the other.  

233
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,099
        to make the roof,       
they construct an aluminum frame

234
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,835
   then glue an aluminum sheet  
            onto it.            

235
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,905
     most of the bus's body     
       is made of aluminum      

236
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,374
            because,            
    compared to other metals,   

237
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,510
   it's lightweight, durable,   
       and easy to repair.      

238
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,779
    next, they paint the roof   

239
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,715
     and install components     
     integrated within it,      

240
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,985
   such as the aerial antenna   
     and wires for lighting.    

241
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,320
   as this computer animation   
          illustrates,          

242
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,325
          step by step,         
 the bus is slowly taking shape.

243
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,261
     workers insert the pegs    
       underneath the roof      

244
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:27,165
  into aluminum pillars running 
the perimeter of the upper deck.

245
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:33,939
    along the sides, workers    
  sandwich the structural frame 

246
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,342
     between inner and outer    
      aluminum body panels.     

247
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,277
             first,             
   they affix the inner ones,   

248
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,412
         then they fill         
      the spaces in between     

249
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:45,484
 with blocks of foam insulation.

250
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,553
     finally, they glue on      
     the outer side panels,     

251
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,689
pressing out the excess adhesive
          with a roller         

252
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,825
  so that the panel lays flat.  

253
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,564
 the front and back of the bus  
 are made of molded fiberglass. 

254
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,566
 they have openings for windows,

255
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,169
        and in the back,        
a cut-out beneath the top window

256
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,505
       for the upper-deck       
        air-conditioner.        

257
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:10,107
        as one crew glues       
all the window glass into place,

258
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,979
  others install the doors and, 
  inside, the upholstered seats 

259
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:17,582
          and a durable         
    non-slip floor covering.    

260
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,786
     once the bus comes back    
      from the paint shop,      

261
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,254
          the factory's         
   quality-control department   

262
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,589
     inspects the interior.     

263
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,661
         the seat fabric        
      is dark and patterned     

264
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,530
     to discourage graffiti.    

265
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,066
   the bus also has 12 cameras  
   hidden in various locations  

266
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,335
       to deter vandalism.      

267
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,404
    the typical double-decker   

268
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,541
        is 11 yards long        
    and nearly 15 feet high.    

269
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,911
 it carries up to 92 passengers.

270
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,761
     narrator: when you need    
      something to lean on,     

271
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,630
   a walking stick can provide  
     the necessary support.     

272
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,899
      wooden walking sticks     
    have been coming in handy   

273
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,634
     since primitive times.     

274
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,370
       the first versions       
   were likely crude branches,  

275
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,640
       but they've evolved      
   into something much finer.   

276
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,980
  today's wooden walking sticks 

277
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,516
     are designed to support    
       the user in style.       

278
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,920
   there are rustic versions    
   for the outdoor adventurer   

279
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,990
 and distinguished-looking ones 
    for getting around town.    

280
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,391
    but, whatever the style,    

281
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:37,195
 a walking stick adds stability 
      to the human journey.     

282
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:41,266
       it all begins with       
   these 3-year-old saplings.   

283
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:45,002
      these are chestnut --     
 a lightweight and durable wood.

284
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,338
         once the sticks        
   have been peeled and dried,  

285
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,873
  it's into the washing machine 

286
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,743
  to scrub off any dirt or mold 
   that may have accumulated.   

287
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,215
          and it's not          
  your usual washing machine -- 

288
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:01,753
 this one is a long tank sized  
 specifically for these sticks. 

289
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,957
 a worker closes the lid tightly
   so no sticks will spill out  

290
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,060
       as the tank rotates      
   in a trough of soapy water.  

291
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,562
       after a few minutes      
        of tossing about,       

292
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,032
      these sticks come out     
         squeaky-clean,         

293
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,034
        and they're ready       
        for the steamer.        

294
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,303
     the sticks are steamed     
         for 20 minutes,        

295
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,373
      and this makes them       
      soft enough to bend.      

296
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,508
  so next, he secures the stick 

297
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,777
          and activates         
      a spring-loaded arm.      

298
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:29,648
 it wraps one end around a form 
    to curl it into a crook.    

299
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,116
           he ties it           
   so it holds the crook shape  

300
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,851
  and retracts the bending arm. 

301
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,054
      this crook will serve     
 as the walking stick's handle. 

302
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,258
      a century ago, crooks     
  were formed entirely by hand, 

303
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,060
   which took brute strength.   

304
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,062
     but with the invention     
     of this nifty machine,     

305
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,398
             the job            
   became a whole lot easier.   

306
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,869
   next, it's over to a device  
 called the straightening horse,

307
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:53,604
        because it's used       
to straighten the stick's shaft.

308
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,874
            this job            
   does take a bit of muscle,   

309
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,476
          as the worker         
wrenches the shaft between posts

310
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,744
       to set it straight.      

311
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,679
 with the shaft now quite linear

312
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,749
 and the end curled into a crook
         and still tied,        

313
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,952
        it's time to set        
the shape of this walking stick.

314
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,356
  and so it's in to the drying  
   room for a couple of days.   

315
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:15,626
   the temperature in here is   
 around 175 degrees fahrenheit. 

316
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,030
     and as the sticks dry,     
     the shape solidifies.      

317
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,900
  a worker then cuts the stick  
     to the correct length,     

318
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:26,071
 and he also pares down the end 
to prepare it for capping later.

319
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,178
       he also sands down       
     the knots in the wood,     

320
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,581
  creating a smoother surface.  

321
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,121
      from a simple sapling     
        to a cane shape,        

322
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,190
  it's quite a transformation.  

323
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,725
       and it's not over.       

324
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,261
         the next worker        
  exposes the wood to a flame,  

325
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,596
 just long enough to blacken it.

326
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,932
        this is staining        
     without the chemicals,     

327
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,535
 and the finish is distinctive. 

328
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,737
 he now turns the walking stick 

329
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,540
      against a very sharp      
         circular blade         

330
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,077
  to carve spirals on the crook 
       and down the shaft.      

331
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,614
   it's a candy-cane look, and  
  achieving it is a bit tricky. 

332
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,385
          this is where         
  on-the-job experience counts. 

333
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,124
    another worker then trims   
  the end of the handle crook.  

334
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,893
the cutoffs won't go to waste --

335
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,696
        they'll help fire       
      the factory furnace.      

336
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,964
next, a worker inserts the crook

337
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,435
    in a machine that works     
    like a pencil sharpener,    

338
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,571
     except the blade inside    
         rounds the end.        

339
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,708
     this process is called     
       "nosing the stick."      

340
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,577
   the stick that started out   
       as a peeled sapling      

341
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,713
            now looks           
     dramatically different.    

342
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,983
           next, a dip          
     in water-based lacquer     

343
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,386
    gives this walking stick    
          a high gloss.         

344
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,988
    they hang it to drip-dry    
          for an hour,          

345
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,857
  after which the walking stick 

346
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,994
    is ready for the end cap,   
           or ferrule.          

347
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:59,263
          ferrules come         
     in a variety of styles.    

348
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,000
    there are blunt ones, for   
 a good grip on indoor surfaces,

349
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,668
 and there are pointed ferrules,

350
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,805
         for navigating         
    rougher, outdoor terrain.   

351
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,741
   after hammering the ferrule  
         onto the stick,        

352
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:12,844
   he drives a nail through it  
          to secure it.         

353
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,016
    and these walking sticks    
        are now complete.       

354
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,351
         all that's left        
        is to hang around       

355
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,153
    until the orders come in.   

356
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,423
        and those orders        
   are usually very specific.   

357
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,824
     customers get to choose    

358
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,894
   the length of stick that's   
  appropriate for their height, 

359
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,931
 as well as the style and finish
          they prefer.          

360
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,635
       from a simple stick      
  to a dignified-looking cane,  

361
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,971
   it's been quite a journey.   

362
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,974
the path ahead may be uncertain,

363
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,910
      but with one of these     
     walking sticks in hand,    

364
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,445
    a person is well-equipped   

365
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:51,182
     to make his or her way     
          in the world.
