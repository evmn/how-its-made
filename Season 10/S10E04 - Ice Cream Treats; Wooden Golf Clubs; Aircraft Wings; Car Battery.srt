before refrigeration, ice cream 
was a handmade luxury.          
ingredients went into a mixing

00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,901
flavor and creates a barrier

sure the particles are settling

they pump out the sludge, then

properly.                       
they pump out the sludge, then

they pump out the sludge, then  
filter the water, which now

00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:02,874
filter the water, which now

the sludge goes into that big   
pile of lead and other metals.

the sludge goes into that big

then it's into a furnace for    
10 hours.                       
the lead melts into a liquid,

the molten lead goes into a

the molten lead goes into a

this cause some remaining       
contaminants to float to the

this cause some remaining

the liquid lead is now fairly

the liquid lead is now fairly

the liquid lead is now fairly

there's enough lead in one of
