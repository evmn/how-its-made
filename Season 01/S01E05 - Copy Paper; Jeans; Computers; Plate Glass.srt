00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,757
narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,292
copy paper --

3
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:32,029
we'll check it out again
and again and again...

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,697
jeans --

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,733
stay tuned
for a "denim-stration"...

6
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:40,938
...computers --
here's some hard data for you...

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,076
...and plate glass --

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,013
we promise you full transparency
in this report.

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,789
computers were supposed to send
paper back to the stone age --

10
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,124
no more letters, just e-mails.

11
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,261
goodbye, typewritten reports.
hello, floppy disks.

12
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,797
well, those predictions
were wrong.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,999
photocopiers and printers

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,437
have us using more paper
than ever before.

15
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,876
paper production begins with
the arrival of wood at the mill.

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,979
paper is made from a paste
produced from a mix

17
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:26,684
of 65% maple, 25% birch,
and 10% poplar.

18
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:31,122
they require two tons of wood
to produce one ton of paste.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,094
everything starts
from this debarking drum,

20
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,563
which removes bark
from the logs.

21
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,898
it's about
a 20-minute operation.

22
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,567
the bark will be burned
to produce steam,

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,102
for the operation of the mill.

24
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,139
the debarked logs are
transported on this conveyor.

25
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,710
all is controlled
by an operator.

26
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,788
now the logs are reduced into
small pieces called kindling.

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,024
they're accumulated into a pile

28
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,995
and remain outdoors
winter and summer.

29
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,731
the kindling looks like this.

30
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:19,871
these 5 piles total
about 30,000 tons of kindling.

31
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:23,007
next step -- reduce the kindling
into a paste.

32
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,009
they begin by washing it.

33
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,612
this screen verifies that
the washer is properly loaded.

34
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,015
then comes alkaline cooking.

35
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,019
this diagram
controls its operation.

36
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,154
this huge cylinder
is the washer,

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,957
in which the kindling is cooked
for several hours

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,227
at a temperature of 315 degrees.

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,230
and this is
the recuperation boiler.

40
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,300
it burns wood lignite
at 1,800 degrees.

41
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,770
certain chemical products,
which come out fused as lava,

42
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,772
are recuperated.

43
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,575
this black lacquer,
a reside of burned wood,

44
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,510
will be burned to produce steam.

45
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,978
exiting the washer,

46
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,981
the brown paste is washed
and sent to the thickener.

47
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,316
with this spatula,

48
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,053
they verify the quality
of the brown-paste washing.

49
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,788
the paste must be bleached.

50
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:14,125
this alkaline-extraction tower
places the brown paste

51
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,327
in contact
with chemical products.

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,996
it's bleached
with chlorine dioxide

53
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,399
and gradually becomes
more white.

54
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:25,036
then the water
is partially drawn off.

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,944
water is extracted
with this equipment,

56
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,146
the beloit bel baie iii
paper machine,

57
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,017
operating at a speed
of 3,500 feet a minute.

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,952
between the entry and the exit,

59
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:46,824
the concentration of water in
the paste falls from 95% to 5%.

60
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,699
here we see the sheet of paper
coming out of the presses.

61
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,235
then analyzers verify

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,971
the quality parameters
of the paper

63
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,306
and signal any anomaly.

64
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,179
the paper is then rolled up.

65
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,350
this roller produces
enormous main spools.

66
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,923
with this transfer arm,

67
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,258
they change a full spool
for an empty one.

68
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,861
a roll weighs over 35 tons

69
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,732
and contains over 37 miles
of paper.

70
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,535
the spooler cuts the main spools
into smaller, less wide rolls.

71
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,537
some will be delivered as is,

72
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,874
while other will be shipped
to paper cutters.

73
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,686
rolls are sent
to an automated warehouse.

74
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,857
in the warehouse, they store
rolls that will be cut later.

75
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,496
robots,
guided on rails in the floor,

76
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,231
feed the bielomatik
paper cutter.

77
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,167
this is the one
that produces copy paper.

78
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,570
robots are controlled
by a central computer

79
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,706
directed by operators.

80
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:19,249
production reaches
55,000 sheets per minute.

81
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,454
we see here the transfer section
of the cutter.

82
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,323
four automatic catchers
and operators

83
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,259
verify paper quality
before packaging.

84
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:35,199
in one hour, this mill produces
6,600 packages of copy paper.

85
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,801
a single log allowed
for the production

86
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,339
of at least 15
of those packages.

87
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,214
narrator: jeans might be

88
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:53,083
the world's greatest
rags-to-riches story.

89
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,152
when they were first invented,

90
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,421
nobody would be caught dead
in them,

91
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,757
except for factory workers,
farmers, and tradesmen.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,895
yet, today, they're one of
the most popular clothing items

93
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,229
in the world --

94
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,199
quite a fashion statement.

95
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:15,573
jeans are made from a highly
rugged cotton called denim.

96
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:19,777
this enormous roll contains
1,500 feet of fabric,

97
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,481
from which they will produce
350 pairs of jeans.

98
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,518
several thicknesses
of the material are unrolled

99
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,052
on this long table.

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,721
this knife can cut up
to 100 thicknesses

101
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,324
of the material at a time.

102
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,726
by multiplying the thicknesses,

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,563
they produce a whole pile
of pieces with one cut.

104
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,404
they shape the denim pieces
following the cutting patterns.

105
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,674
each piece of the jeans
has its own cutting pattern.

106
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,280
the little pieces of fabric
are cut with a clicker,

107
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,082
also known as the stamper,

108
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,951
which cuts out pockets
with a cutting mold.

109
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,621
exerting 1,500 pounds
of pressure,

110
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,956
it can cut 20 pockets at a time.

111
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,491
they begin sewing.

112
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,761
jeans are sewn
with 100%-cotton thread.

113
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,532
this needle pierces the fabric
4,000 times a minute.

114
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:24,374
designs are embroidered on
the pockets with this machine.

115
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,179
its needles move
at 2,500 strokes per minute.

116
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,851
this pocket robot

117
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,521
will simultaneously fold,
press, and sew a pocket.

118
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,923
this machine allows
for the installation

119
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,394
of 75 pockets in 60 minutes.

120
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:56,674
the pocket is now
sewn into place.

121
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,015
next step -- the buttonhole.

122
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,618
this machine sews the contours
of the buttonhole

123
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:11,422
and a steel blade comes down
to cut the opening.

124
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,225
the closing button
is positioned.

125
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,066
this machine is used
to make the loops,

126
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,837
which will hold the belt
in place.

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,774
the loops are sewn, as usual,
with cotton thread.

128
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,588
at this stage, they assemble the
different pieces of the jeans.

129
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,359
this operator joins the two
pieces of denim at the crotch.

130
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,164
then she sews it.

131
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,805
then they sew the exterior
of the leg.

132
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,608
this sewing is done flat,
with an overcaster,

133
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:10,080
which cuts excess material
proportionately and to size.

134
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,551
now for the zipper.

135
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,490
this machine installs
the zipper holdfast

136
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,225
and the slide.

137
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,967
the zipper is sewn
into its position.

138
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,173
the final sewing step consists
of installing the jeans belt,

139
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,242
a strip of fabric.

140
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:46,650
this operation requires
only a few seconds.

141
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,728
the jeans were made up
on the reverse side,

142
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,296
so that all stitches
would be on the inside

143
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,932
when the jeans are worn.

144
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,268
the pant is then turned
right side out with this turner,

145
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,905
which has 100-pound
suction power.

146
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,078
all that now remains
is to steam-press the jeans.

147
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,681
this operation lasts
only 20 seconds

148
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,483
and eliminates any pleats.

149
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,287
this company makes
1,500 jeans every day.

150
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,989
producing a pair of jeans

151
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,361
will have taken 12 minutes
and 50 seconds of work

152
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:36,800
and will have required between
3.6 and 3.9 feet of fabric.

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,576
narrator:
just 30 years ago,

154
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,579
nobody could have told you
what this object was,

155
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,248
let alone the kind of wonders
you could work with it.

156
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,784
well, times change,

157
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:58,455
and today, it's hard to imagine
a single modern home or office

158
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:03,460
without at least one
of these revolutionary devices.

159
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,666
it takes about 90 minutes
to assemble a computer.

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,003
its hard-disk drive saves
information transmitted to it

161
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,938
for a long time.

162
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,474
the reading head
reads the information.

163
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,942
it is extremely precise.

164
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,145
the space between the
reading head and the hard disk

165
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,548
is as thin as a hair.

166
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,352
the hard disk is installed
in its position

167
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,153
within the computer.

168
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,023
there are two other units
which safeguard information --

169
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,292
the removable
3-inch-disk reader,

170
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,694
and the cd-rom reader,

171
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,464
which allows for the reading
and execution

172
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,933
of programs recorded
on compact discs.

173
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,641
these two units
are placed into position.

174
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,310
the spinal column of the
computer is the motherboard.

175
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,779
it is to this unit

176
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:59,049
that the other elements
of the computer are connected.

177
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,253
this cooler dissipates the heat
generated by the chip set.

178
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,654
certain sound cards

179
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,123
are integrated
directly on the motherboard.

180
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,794
these connections, in sequence,
are the audio input,

181
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:14,198
its output,
and the microphone port.

182
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:19,603
this agp retaining ring secures
the video card during transport.

183
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,472
this thermal unit measures
the temperature emitted

184
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,609
between the processor
and the motherboard.

185
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,011
the processor is the brain
of the system.

186
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,880
it interprets, calculates,

187
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,016
and executes the instructions
given to it.

188
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,752
the processor has
several million transistors.

189
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,354
and its cadence,
its operating speed,

190
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,223
reaches the gigahertz level.

191
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,159
the processor rests
on this base.

192
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,429
the processor's cooler
dissipates the intense heat.

193
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,433
its efficiency depends
on the type of material used,

194
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,870
and a conducting material
assures better cooling.

195
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,175
the r.a.m. memory stores
short-term information,

196
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,978
but erases it
when the current is turned off.

197
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,046
this memory is more rapid

198
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,216
than that of the hard disk
or cd-rom.

199
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,918
now they integrate everything
in the case.

200
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,121
it protects
the internal elements

201
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,190
from the external elements.

202
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,591
at this stage,

203
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,295
they install the electronic
components in this case.

204
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,199
several connectors of the case

205
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,468
are connected
to the motherboard,

206
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,705
such as the computator
and various light indicators.

207
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,279
this is the output connection
for the video card,

208
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,615
which links the computer
to the monitor.

209
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,484
we also see the video chip,

210
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,487
which creates images
in 2 and 3 dimensions.

211
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,089
here is the video memory.

212
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,425
the more its capacity
is increased,

213
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,761
the clearer will be the image
displayed on the monitor.

214
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,565
the video card is placed
into its position.

215
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,300
the modem allows two computers
to communicate.

216
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,438
its capacitors produce
the perfectly clean phone signal

217
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,974
to facilitate communications.

218
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,709
these modem chip connectors

219
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,446
control information circulating
between the two computers.

220
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,649
the fax modem is installed.

221
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,118
the power supply
transforms electricity

222
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,719
according to the voltage

223
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,089
required by
the different components.

224
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,663
the computer's internal cabling
is installed.

225
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,798
it allows information
to travel

226
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,401
between the different media
and the motherboard.

227
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,639
the i.d.e. cable is connected
and the cd-rom.

228
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,757
the last electrical wires

229
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,728
are connected to different
computer components.

230
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:17,447
the assembly of 30 components
of the computer is now finished.

231
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,050
just before closing the case,
they test each computer

232
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,187
to verify the good functioning
of the peripherals.

233
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,524
then they close up
and proceed to packaging.

234
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:32,029
this company produces about
300 computer units every day.

235
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,337
narrator:
no need to adjust your set.

236
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,942
what you're looking at
is supposed to be hard to see.

237
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,743
here at "how it's made,"

238
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,147
our job is to explore
the everyday things around us

239
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,948
and how they came to be.

240
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,218
so let's start by making
one thing perfectly clear --

241
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,056
manufacturing plate glass
is anything but simple.

242
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,098
we can speak of the use of glass

243
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,301
since the time of the egyptians
4,000 years ago.

244
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,503
it wasn't used
in construction, though,

245
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,640
but merely to enclose
small objects.

246
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,310
later, the romans became masters
of glassmaking,

247
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,047
with their methods being used
up until the 18th century.

248
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,916
by the end of the 19th century,

249
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,452
glass was no longer
just a luxury item,

250
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,787
but became
a construction material

251
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,557
as common
as steel and concrete.

252
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,802
plate glass is made
from several raw materials

253
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,071
mixed with a little water.

254
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,941
these materials
are silica sand...

255
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,675
soda ash...

256
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,344
dolomite...

257
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,479
limestone...

258
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,215
nepheline syenite...

259
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,251
and salt cake.

260
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,824
it begins by dumping
into a hopper

261
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:12,095
pieces of recycled glass
together with the raw materials.

262
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,830
it will all be melted.

263
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,699
in a continuous stream,

264
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,403
the mixed materials go
into a gas-fed furnace.

265
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,110
temperature inside the furnace
is 2,700 degrees.

266
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,180
it contains 1,500 tons
of molten glass.

267
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,383
they use 500 tons of it
every day.

268
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,585
in this regenerating chamber,

269
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:39,656
combustion air is preheated
to 1,800 degrees.

270
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,594
the materials of the mix
begin fusing,

271
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,130
and the molten glass
is stirred up.

272
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:52,535
the homogenizer mixes the glass
to equalize its temperature.

273
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,606
pouring will be done
within several hours.

274
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,074
in the glass industry,

275
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,610
they call this machine
the top roller.

276
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,546
the glass is poured onto a bath
of liquid tin,

277
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,014
on which it floats.

278
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,151
as soft as toffee,
it is molded into a ribbon.

279
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,555
all equipment in the tin bath
is cooled with water

280
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,057
so that it won't break
from the heat.

281
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,363
coming out of the bath,
the glass is at 600 degrees.

282
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,699
the glass must again be cooled,

283
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,502
and this unit
is used to do that.

284
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:32,576
this huge ribbon of glass
is 11 feet in width.

285
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,589
the ribbon of glass
rolls gently on rollers,

286
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,858
gradually cooling along the way.

287
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,198
the glass is still soft.

288
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,536
the marks we see are imprints
from the top roller.

289
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,672
the glass must have
a uniform thickness.

290
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,675
this laser scanner measures
its thickness

291
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,612
to within a hundredth
of a millimeter.

292
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:12,682
the glass is now fairly hard.
they proceed to cutting it.

293
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,951
this ultrahard
tungsten-carbide roller

294
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:21,091
makes a longitudinal score
before the glass can be cut.

295
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,960
now they proceed
with transverse scoring,

296
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,029
made according to the dimensions
customers have asked for.

297
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,133
the scored glass
separates easily.

298
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:40,443
the glass strips are separated
and continue along the conveyor.

299
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,924
these roller breakers cut
the edges of the glass sheet.

300
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,997
leftover pieces fall
to the ground and into a chute.

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,999
they will later be recycled.

302
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,474
these rubber-covered rollers
move the glass sheets

303
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,543
to the inspection department.

304
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,480
when they arrive for inspection,

305
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,916
these immense glass sheets
are handled with great care

306
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,153
and are positioned upright.

307
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,565
the glass is inspected
for faults

308
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,902
with florescent lamps.

309
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,104
once inspected,

310
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,573
the glass sheets are handled
one at a time

311
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,909
and stored vertically.

312
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:54,184
making the glass
took several days of work.

313
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,720
it is now ready for delivery.

314
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,057
heat fusion has transformed
solid ingredients

315
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,860
into transparent glass.
