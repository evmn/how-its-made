2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,773
      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,920
 narrator: in a world dominated 
    by high-tech gadgetry,      

4
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,791
  the low-tech straight razor   
still gets a lot of face time.  

5
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:02,928
  it can be reused endlessly,   
    and it has a traditional    
            appeal,             

6
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,530
  one that actually dates back  
       to ancient egypt,        

7
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,402
    when there were straight    
             razors             
      made of solid gold.       

8
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:16,008
   shaving with an unguarded    
       super-sharp knife        

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,976
        has always been         
      for the tough guys.       

10
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:23,449
    to use it, a man needs a    
             steady             
hand and steely concentration.  

11
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,956
  production begins with steel  
 cylinders heated in a furnace  

12
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,093
         until they're          
      soft and malleable.       

13
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,628
  a forging hammer then pounds  
    the cylinders into dies     

14
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,632
        to shape them.          

15
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:42,168
a punch cutter trims the edges  

16
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,304
       and cuts the shape       
       into two blades.         

17
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:51,844
  from a steel rod to a flat,   
    razor shape in just a few   
             steps.             

18
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:56,248
  the straight razors are then  
               fed              
 to another die one at a time.  

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,517
    a wade forces the razor     
         into the die,          

20
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,387
           a process            
 which both improves the shape  

21
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,124
    and condenses the metal     
       to strengthen it.        

22
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,260
   next, a worker dips a rack   
      of about 50 blades        

23
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,197
      in graphite powder,       
   followed by molten lead.     

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,132
  the lead adds more strength   
         to the steel.          

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,735
    he knocks off the lead,     

26
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:19,138
     which slides off easily    
             because            
  of the graphite undercoat.    

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,206
  the razor blades catch fire   

28
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,810
   as he immerses them in oil   
         to cool them.          

29
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,546
    he transfers the blades     
          to a sieve            

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,548
 and tosses saw dust into it.   

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,885
 the saw dust soaks up the oil  
     and graphite residue.      

32
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,221
    then he shakes the sieve    
        to sift it out.         

33
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,423
 after a hardening treatment,   

34
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,093
       it's into an oven        
        to bake slowly.         

35
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,897
  this gets rid of brittleness  
      and relieves internal     
           stresses.            

36
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,366
          a technician          
  then scrutinizes the razor    

37
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,101
to confirm that it's straight.  

38
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:52,538
          if it's not,          
   he hammers it straighter.    

39
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,108
    another worker grinds the   
             blade,             

40
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,244
        angling it down         
      to the cutting edge       

41
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:00,846
         using a series         
      of abrasive wheels.       

42
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,782
       he tests the edge        
  against a thick metal band.   

43
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,385
     it needs to be as thin     
       as aluminum foil         

44
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,988
   and strong, yet flexible.    

45
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,391
    the next worker brushes     
        asphalt lacquer         

46
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,761
 onto the blade and upper part  
    of the handle, or tang.     

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,467
     this coating prepares      
the surface for laser-etching.  

48
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,738
           it allows            
  the computerized laser beam   

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,339
 to cut cleanly into the metal  

50
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,277
        with no bleeding        
      around the edges...       

51
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,880
  ...so the trademark insignia  
      and art look crisp.       

52
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,883
    she paints a little more    
             lacquer            
      around the etching        

53
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:42,488
    to prepare the blade for    
the next step -- gold-plating.  

54
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,557
       she dips the blade       
  in a mix of water and gold    

55
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,828
     and runs a current of      
 electricity through the mix.   

56
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,163
      this causes the gold      
         to gravitate           

57
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,032
  to the exposed, un-lacquered  
     section of the blade       

58
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,634
       and adhere to it.        

59
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,836
     the lacquer has served     
         its purpose,           

60
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,971
   and she now cleans it off    
      in a chemical bath        

61
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,776
           to reveal            
    the now-glossy, two-toned   
             blade.             

62
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,118
      next, she sandwiches      
  the tang of the razor blade   

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,787
   between two plastic parts    
        of the handle,          

64
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,390
        using a long pin        
 to hold everything together.   

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,597
   she then shortens the pin,   
           caps it,             

66
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,069
    and hammers the cap down    
         to secure it.          

67
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,038
        she now tests the       
         installation.          

68
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,211
     the next worker grinds     
       the entire blade         

69
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,214
   against a slightly concave   
        abrasive wheel,         

70
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:46,551
  further sharpening it while   
maintaining the slope profile.  

71
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,889
   she then hones the cutting   
              edge              
     against a wet stone,       

72
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:53,491
  tests it against a cow horn,  
   and then hones it again.     

73
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:58,097
         this last step         
  makes the edge razor-sharp.   

74
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,299
    she immerses the blades     
           in chalk,            

75
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,035
     which absorbs moisture     
      to prevent rusting.       

76
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,505
   she now strokes the cutting  
              edge              
   against a leather strap.     

77
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,174
   this is called stropping.    

78
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:10,709
       it gives the blade       
       its final polish.        

79
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,846
  and now she removes a single  
 artificial hair from a bundle  

80
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,782
          and confirms          
   that this straight razor     

81
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,585
        is sharp enough         
      to slice it in two.       

82
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,922
        it takes a total        
     of 80 different steps      

83
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,923
    to manufacture a straight   
             razor.             

84
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,060
      we've just shown you      
        the highlights.         

85
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,067
     properly maintained, a     
            straight            
razor should last for decades.  

86
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:57,222
     narrator: it's common      
  to many european cultures.    

87
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,625
       the french call it       
        "boudin noir."          

88
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,760
       the spanish call it      
          "morcilla."           

89
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,095
      the italians call it      
        "sanguinaccio."         

90
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,499
   and in the united kingdom,   
 they call it "black pudding."  

91
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,034
          what is it?           

92
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:14,540
 a savory dish made from pigs'  
 blood and other ingredients.   

93
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,909
      in england, ireland,      
     scotland, and wales,       

94
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,712
   black pudding is typically   
    served sliced and fried     

95
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,247
            as part             
  of a traditional breakfast.   

96
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,918
    its roots are in ancient    
             times,             
  when people wouldn't waste    

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,188
   any part of a slaughtered    
  animal, not even its blood.   

98
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,525
  black pudding also contains   
  several dry ingredients --    

99
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,860
           barley...            

100
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,595
          allspice...           

101
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,131
        dried onions...         

102
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,334
spices and other seasonings...  

103
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,670
       and wheat flour.         

104
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:48,607
        the pigs' blood         
    is also in dried form.      

105
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,477
     they begin by filling      
    cotton bags with barley     

106
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,479
      and submerging them       
  in boiling water overnight.   

107
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:58,484
      the bags are porous,      
    so the barley absorbs the   
             water,             

108
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,886
     swelling and softening     
         as it cooks.           

109
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,754
   once the barley is ready,    

110
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:07,159
    they drain the water out    
      of the cook tank...       

111
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:12,164
   then cut open the bags and   
              empty             
 the cooked barley into a tub.  

112
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,372
           the barley           
   and other dry ingredients    

113
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,374
   will make up about a third   
      of the pudding mix.       

114
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,909
         another third          
      is the pigs' blood;       

115
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,112
 and the last third, meat fat.  

116
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:33,519
       they boil pork fat       
 in a cook tank for two hours.  

117
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,793
 then they strain out the water 
and transfer the fat to a tub.  

118
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,038
   in another cook tank, they   
              boil              
    smoked-bacon fat for two    
             hours.             

119
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,477
      then they scoop out       
      and strain that fat       

120
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,146
   and drop it into a bin, as   
             well.              

121
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,215
       the scraps of meat       
 clinging to the pieces of fat  

122
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,819
  will give the black pudding   
         extra flavor.          

123
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,891
   next, workers empty the two  
              bins              
     of fat into a mincer.      

124
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,893
  then they take dried onions   

125
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,497
  and hydrate them with stock   
   from the smoked-bacon cook   
             tank.              

126
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,937
     this produces gravy.       

127
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,108
     they pour this gravy,      
 along with the cooked barley,  

128
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,977
       into the mincer.         

129
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,684
    next, they add the flour    
     and mince some more.       

130
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,061
    and then the dried pigs'    
             blood.             

131
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,665
       besides turning the      
           ingredients          
         a rich color,          

132
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,669
  the blood makes black pudding 
                a               
     rich source of iron and    
            protein.            

133
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:01,273
   they mince the ingredients   
 until the mixture is smooth.   

134
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,043
     then they transfer it      
     to the stuffing line.      

135
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,083
   a worker pumps a specific    
 quantity into a nylon casing,  

136
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:14,686
     then staples each end      
     of the casing closed.      

137
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,163
    this is the 7 1/2 pound     
         retail size.           

138
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,297
   the factory also packages    
        larger formats          

139
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,902
        for restaurants,        
         delicatessens,         
         and caterers.          

140
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,704
    from the stuffing line,     

141
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,041
       the black puddings       
    go into a steam cooker.     

142
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,715
       once their internal      
           temperature          
       reaches 185 degrees      
          fahrenheit,           

143
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:47,185
  which takes about two hours,  
  they come out of the oven.    

144
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,055
   they're textured now like    
  a dense chocolate pudding.    

145
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,861
   after cooling overnight,     

146
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,832
       each black pudding       
   goes into a printed plastic  
              bag.              

147
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,738
        a vacuum machine        
    sucks out all the air,      

148
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,807
  and heat seals the package.   

149
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,777
         this improves          
   the product's shelf life.    

150
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,417
 from there, the puddings drop  
   into a tank of hot water.    

151
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,022
    this shrinks the plastic    
             package            
  tightly around the casing.    

152
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,158
 even within the same country,  

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,426
     black pudding recipes      
        vary by region.         

154
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,030
  this smooth-textured pudding  
      is typical of eastern     
           scotland.            

155
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,233
   in western scotland, they    
use oatmeal instead of barley,  

156
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,502
   and, in northern england,    

157
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,771
 they use big, usually visible, 
        chunks of fat,          

158
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,306
both producing a black pudding  

159
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,676
   that's coarser in texture    
    but equally delicious.      

160
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,725
           narrator:            
    the earliest automobiles    

161
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,127
         that's a lever         
     attached to a rudder.      

162
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,863
    the first steering wheel    
       appeared in 1894,        

163
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:08,000
       in a car built by        
the panhard company of france.  

164
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,603
   today, the steering wheel    
 is a multitasking component,   

165
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:16,007
  integrating control switches  
and the driver's-side air bag.  

166
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,544
      a car steering wheel      
    looks simple enough --      

167
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,680
   a stylish ring with a horn   
         in the middle          

168
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,882
    and switches to operate     
      the cruise control        

169
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,484
     and other functions.       

170
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,887
  yet despite this simplicity,  
    a steering-wheel design     

171
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,756
        undergoes years         
  of development and testing    

172
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:36,561
    for safety, durability,     
   appearance, and function.    

173
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,363
   the manufacturing process    

174
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,166
   begins with the armature,    
      the internal support      
           structure.           

175
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,969
      it's made of either       
   aluminum or magnesium --     

176
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,905
strong yet lightweight metals.  

177
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,907
    the factory's die-casting   
             system             

178
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,578
 injects the hot, molten metal  
 into an armature-shaped mold.  

179
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,380
  once the metal solidifies,    

180
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,449
 the machine ejects the casting 
        from the mold.          

181
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,985
    the metal is still hot.     

182
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,320
         so a robot arm         
    moves the cast armature     

183
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,724
       to a cooling area,       
  where cold air blows on it.   

184
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,592
 they remove the excess metal   

185
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,594
           left over            
   from the casting process     

186
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,130
         in one strike          
     with a trimming die.       

187
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,999
         and with that,         
   the armature is finished,    

188
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,070
     and the steering-wheel     
            assembly            
          can begin.            

189
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,009
    first, a robot installs     
         four rivets,           

190
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,678
       the contact points       
     for the horn system.       

191
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,947
   when you press to honk the   
              horn,             
      the rivets complete       

192
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,552
     an electrical circuit,     
  enabling the horn to sound.   

193
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:37,088
     next, a computer-guided    
            engraver            
      marks a lot number        

194
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,591
 for quality-control tracking.  

195
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,131
    this demonstration shows    
  the basis of the next step.   

196
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,967
     when mixed together,       

197
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,237
     these two polyurethane     
            chemicals           
      react to each other       

198
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,172
and produce an expanding foam.  

199
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:58,110
   by guiding this expansion    
within the confines of a mold,  

200
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:01,979
  one can make this dense foam  
   assume a specific shape,     

201
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,382
          such as that          
     of a steering wheel.       

202
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,886
     the process is called      
  reaction injection molding.   

203
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,859
   they coat the mold cavity    
     with a release agent       

204
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,594
      to prevent sticking,      
  place the armature inside,    

205
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,064
          then inject           
  the polyurethane chemicals.   

206
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,531
     the chemicals react,       

207
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,468
 and the foam instantly expands 
    within the mold cavity,     

208
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,336
    encasing the armature.      

209
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,938
      prior to injection,       

210
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,274
   they also sprayed the mold   
 cavity with protective paint.  

211
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,745
 it tints the foam the required 
 color -- in this case, black.  

212
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,616
   it also protects the foam    
 against wear and u.v. damage.  

213
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,617
 the injection-molding process  

214
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,020
   leaves excess polyurethane   
    on the steering wheel.      

215
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,324
        so the next step        
      is to trim it off.        

216
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,362
    with the steering-wheel     
      structure complete,       

217
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,698
    it's now time to install    
        the components.         

218
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
    these switches control      

219
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,103
     the features operable      
   from the steering wheel.     

220
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:01,773
     workers assemble them      
      into housings called      
           finishers.           

221
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:05,310
  the finishers are molded out  
       of plastic resin,        

222
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,947
    then coated with metallic   
              paint             
     for a high-end look.       

223
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,317
       the switch wiring        

224
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,121
   has already been assembled   
              into              
 a unit called a wire harness.  

225
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,657
    they connect the harness    
        to the switches         

226
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,393
         and install it         
   onto the steering wheel.     

227
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:29,067
      then they check that      
everything functions properly.  

228
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,605
        and if it does,         
    they mark the assembly      

229
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:37,208
     to show that it passes     
this stage of quality control.  

230
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,410
         after applying         
      a bar-code sticker,       

231
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,480
     they route the wiring      
  through the steering wheel    

232
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,149
     to prepare it for final    
            assembly            

233
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,151
       on the automaker's       
        assembly line.          

234
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,020
       next, they install       
      spring mechanisms.        

235
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,556
         these support          
      the air-bag module,       

236
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,494
 enabling it to move in and out 
   when you sound the horn.     

237
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:58,163
    then they attach the horn   
             plate,             
     to which the carmaker      

238
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:03,501
     will later attach the      
 driver's-side air-bag module.  

239
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,770
   they take the ground wire    
     and the wire harness       

240
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,573
      and position it...        

241
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,243
  then flip the steering wheel  
      and secure the switch     
           finishers            

242
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,447
      to the exposed back       
       of the armature.         

243
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,849
 then they install a back cover 
    made of plastic resin,      

244
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,719
       the color matching       
    the rest of the steering    
             wheel.             

245
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,788
      a robot arm equipped      
         with a camera          

246
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,359
      performs a thorough       
  quality-control inspection.   

247
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,532
while the basics are the same,  

248
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,468
         features vary          
     from model to model.       

249
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,470
   higher-end steering wheels   
    are wrapped in leather      

250
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,940
         and often have         
     extra switch controls      

251
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,211
  for the audio system and for  
hands-free use of a cellphone.  

252
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,427
           narrator:            
 people have always used color  

253
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,229
 prehistoric man created paint  

254
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,898
       from a mix of dirt       
    and animal fat or spit.     

255
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,500
      over the centuries,       

256
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,502
 pigment production has become  
   a lot more sophisticated.    

257
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,639
     chemical manufacturing     
            produces            
  synthetic mineral pigments    

258
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,442
          to add color          
 to the products in our world.  

259
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,913
      from pavers to paint      
   to plastic and cosmetics,    

260
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,850
    this is where the color     
         comes from --          

261
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,785
  synthetic mineral pigments.   

262
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:31,456
     they start with a salt     
            recycled            
   from the steel industry.     

263
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:36,728
     in this case, it's iron    
            sulfate,            
 which has a bluish-green hue.  

264
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,600
    they add warm water, and    
             they're            
  ready for the next ingredient 
               --               

265
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,135
      high-quality scrap.       

266
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,870
 it's another source of iron,   

267
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,439
 and it's about to be recycled  
         into pigment.          

268
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,977
          crane claws           
    transfer it to the mix.     

269
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,682
     chemicals are added.       

270
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,289
        every so often,         

271
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,892
    a technician scrutinizes    
a sample of the yellow slurry.  

272
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,762
    if he decides the color     
    or thickness aren't quite   
             right,             

273
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,164
   adjustments will be made.    

274
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,502
      the slurry now flows      
 over a perforated metal drum   

275
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,171
      with a filter cloth       
     stretched across it.       

276
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,241
      as a spray of water       
     rinses off the salt,       

277
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,176
the fluid in the yellow slurry  

278
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,712
  is sucked through the filter  
   cloth and into the drum,     

279
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,582
  leaving a more concentrated   
    pigment on the surface,     

280
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,317
      called filter cake.       

281
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,054
    the filter cake falls in    
             chunks             
     onto a screw conveyor      

282
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,591
     and ends up at the top     
  of a towering spray dryer.    

283
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:44,195
   inside, machinery presses    
     the highly concentrated    
            pigment             

284
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,064
       through the holes        
      of a rotating disk.       

285
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,000
     this causes a spray of     
            droplets            

286
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,604
 that, when exposed to hot air, 
 dries into pigment particles.  

287
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,939
      this yellow pigment       
   is now ready to be mixed     

288
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,410
     into an emulsion paint     
    for coloring wallpaper.     

289
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:02,347
       a generous amount        
  can produce a bolder shade.   

290
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:06,351
         a little less,         
 and it's more mellow yellow.   

291
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,624
  to make black pigment, they   
 start with cast-iron filings,  

292
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,093
          another form          
     of automotive scrap.       

293
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:20,831
 this magnetic crane transfers  
  the filings for production,   

294
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,102
    and, again, it will take    
      a chemical reaction       

295
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,038
to produce the pigment slurry.  

296
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,508
     the chemical reaction      
     also generates energy      

297
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,780
   that's recovered and used    
 in the manufacturing process.  

298
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,917
    they wash and thicken the   
              black             
  slurry on a revolving drum,   

299
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,586
       just like they did       
    for the yellow pigment,     

300
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,057
   but this thick paste won't   
              just              
be used to make black pigment.  

301
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,194
      it will also be used      
         to make red.           

302
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,530
  for the dramatic conversion   
            to red,             

303
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,066
    the paste flows directly    
         into a kiln,           

304
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,202
  where it's baked until dry.   

305
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,604
       they introduce air       
 and increase the temperature   

306
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,741
          to more than          
   1,500 degrees fahrenheit,    

307
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:05,677
   making the black particle    
           turn red.            

308
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,612
 they transfer the red pigment  
          to a drum,            

309
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,550
   where they mix the pigment   
      and adjust the color      
          properties.           

310
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,154
       they then grind it       
    to a finer consistency.     

311
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,559
        once the pigment        
  is packaged in paper bags,    

312
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,462
    it's ready for transport    
        or warehousing.         

313
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,102
          like sugar,           

314
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,838
     pigment comes in both      
    a powdered and granulated   
             form.              

315
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,042
    this demonstration shows    
   the difference between the   
              two.              

316
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:39,644
      the powdered pigment      
        is more clumpy          

317
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,846
        and doesn't flow        
    from the open end of the    
            beaker.             

318
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,381
          by contrast,          
     the granular pigments      

319
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,651
      are tiny micro beads      
       that flow freely,        

320
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,720
   which makes it desirable     

321
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:52,791
   for users who want to mix    
     and meter pigments more    
            easily.             

322
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,593
    to test how the pigment     
      would color brick,        

323
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,663
      they mix red pigment      
  with a concrete substitute    

324
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,399
    and compared the result     
        to the standard         

325
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,002
to confirm that they match up.  

326
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,072
    but sometimes they need     
    a real concrete example     

327
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,809
  of a pigment's color tone.    

328
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,945
   so they add a small amount   
  to a mixer full of aggregate  
               --               

329
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,613
       water and cement.        

330
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,348
      the mixer rotates,        

331
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,751
    and once the ingredients    
    are thoroughly blended,     

332
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:23,822
       they open the lid        
to reveal the red brick paste.  

333
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:28,692
 they scoop it up for transfer  
 to a brick-forming machine...  

334
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,297
   and then fill brick forms    
        with the paste.         

335
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,434
    they activate a plunger     
      that tamps it down        

336
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:40,572
 to compact it into the forms,  
       producing bricks.        

337
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,845
    red, black, or yellow,      

338
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,182
   these pigments are sure to   
              make
