captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,787
narrator: in the late 1800s,   

4
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,722
the american military      

5
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,259
tried modifying bicycles to help infantrymen cross rough terrain.            

6
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,596
cyclists continued experimenting,     

7
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:07,266
and the first mountain bike was created in 1978.       

8
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:11,137
the popularity of mountain biking has grown ever since.   

9
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,874
mountain bikes are specially designed      

10
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,876
to perform on rough terrain.   

11
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,279
they have a suspension to help keep the wheels     

12
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,681
in contact with the ground,   

13
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:24,350
deep-treaded tires for added traction,       

14
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:27,552
and powerful disc brakes for safety.           

15
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:31,156
at the core of a mountain bike is the small, robust frame.   

16
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,827
it needs to be lightweight yet highly durable.       

17
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,297
the factory uses a test bench to simulate the effects     

18
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,901
of repeated impacts and vibration on the bike frame.   

19
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,035
three days of testing      

20
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:47,439
can simulate 10 years of intensive use.        

21
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,576
the frame is made from tubes of aluminum alloy.  

22
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,447
aluminum is lighter than steel 
and cheaper than carbon fiber,  

23
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:58,450
and it won't burst like carbon in case of a large impact.    

24
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:02,054
they cut each tube to the required length.     

25
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,657
they use jigs to get consistent dimensions   

26
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,725
and precise cutting angles.   

27
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,496
this will be extremely important when they assemble the frame.  

28
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:18,337
each model and size of frame has its own welding jig.     

29
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,340
they start tack-welding the tubes in place.       

30
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,409
then they proceed with the final welding.     

31
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,880
it's a delicate step because the tubes are very thin.              

32
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,816
after welding,          

33
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,619
the aluminum frame       
will undergo a heat treatment.  

34
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,088
first, the frames will be heated intensely,    

35
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,691
then quickly quenched in a cool bath.         

36
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,493
this makes the metal easier to work with.       

37
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,030
this next step is necessary   

38
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:47,032
because slight deformations are created in the frame     

39
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,301
during welding.         

40
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,304
using precise measuring instruments and a rubber mallet             

41
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,173
to avoid denting the metal,   

42
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,376
a technician ensures the frame is perfectly parallel      

43
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,511
to the alignment table.     

44
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,247
it's not easy to align the shorter tubes,   

45
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:06,051
so he uses a longer rod for this task.          

46
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,519
after alignment, the frame    

47
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,389
will be heated one last time to harden the aluminum.     

48
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,393
once the aluminum exhibits the right mechanical properties,           

49
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,863
it's ready for boring.      

50
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,198
this crucial procedure      

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,068
makes the inside        
of the hole perfectly straight  

52
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,937
and aligned with the frame's geometric design.        

53
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,141
in the painting department, they spray auto-grade paint,   

54
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,211
which then dries in an oven for 20 minutes.         

55
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,615
next they use ink transfer tape              

56
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,019
to apply the logo on the bicycle frame.      

57
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,154
after that logo dries in the oven,           

58
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:45,023
they will finish with a clear coat of varnish.  

59
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,759
everything must be perfect.   

60
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,829
when buying a new bicycle, most mountain bikers       

61
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:53,499
pay very close attention to the quality of the paint job.              

62
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,705
the bicycle is ready for the final assembly.     

63
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,641
the assembler starts with the rear shock absorber,  

64
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,578
which contains oil to dampen the suspension movement.     

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,313
this way, the suspension     

66
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,984
doesn't bounce up and down uncontrollably after an impact.             

67
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,921
the stiffness of that dampening is adjustable by the rider.   

68
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,825
the assembler links the shock absorber to the seat stay.    

69
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,862
he installs the handlebar    

70
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,830
and the stem on the steering column.     

71
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,870
next he installs the rear brake caliper.     

72
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:34,005
this is a hydraulic brake, actioned by brake fluid     

73
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,208
that travels through a hydraulic hose.    

74
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,877
it's positioned on the frame in such a way          

75
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,947
that anchoring clips don't restrict its movement.   

76
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,616
now it's time to install the crankset     

77
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,819
and the derailleurs.       

78
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,221
these are useful on technical terrain,      

79
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,756
where quick gear changes     

80
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:54,960
are key to successfully maneuvering trail obstacles.   

81
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,563
he installs the rear wheel.   

82
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:01,300
it's equipped with 10 cogs and a disc brake.        

83
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,902
its deep-treaded tire will grip the ground       

84
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,305
of treacherous mountain paths.  

85
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,041
now he screws in the front brake caliper.     

86
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:16,448
it takes about an hour to fully assemble the mountain bike.   

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,984
the fork provides the front suspension...          

88
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,323
...while the rear suspension  
is connected to the rear wheel  

89
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,792
through a system of pivots at the back.           

90
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,527
as the wheel and pivots move back and forth,       

91
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,264
their movement is dampened by the shock absorber,      

92
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,267
helping to keep the wheel in contact with the ground.   

93
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,670
mountain bikes are engineered  

94
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,674
to withstand the demands of off-road riding.       

95
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,543
precise manufacturing and testing           

96
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:48,213
also ensure that the mountain  
bike will survive years of use  

97
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,082
and abuse.            

98
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,597
narrator: in many parts of the world,   

99
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,066
rice is the main grain.     

100
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:08,867
in fact, it is a food staple   

101
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,136
for nearly half of the planet's population.   

102
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,671
native to asia,         

103
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,608
it has been grown and consumed for thousands of years.     

104
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,210
but today, machines do much of the harvesting and processing           

105
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,480
in order to feed the enormous demand.       

106
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,952
these perfectly formed kernels of rice         

107
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,754
are essentially a crop      

108
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,957
that has been allowed to go to seed.          

109
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,493
after about 150 days of growth,             

110
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,629
the rice seed is ready for harvest.      

111
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,031
machinery strips it from the stalks         

112
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,768
and also suctions out some of the empty husks.     

113
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:50,576
trucks transport the rice to storage facilities.      

114
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:54,312
they empty it into a grated opening at the receiving pit.  

115
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,549
the grates filter out some of the larger stalks and debris.             

116
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,923
from the pit,          

117
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,858
a chain conveyor moves the rice up to storage silos       

118
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,694
and into warehouses.       

119
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,866
inside the storage facilities,  

120
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,402
fans blow air through the mountain of rice   

121
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:19,104
to lower the moisture content substantially.          

122
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:23,409
with the rice sufficiently dried,       

123
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,945
it's on to the processing plant.             

124
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,079
here, a probe vacuums up samples             

125
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,883
from both the front and the back of the massive truckload.    

126
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,022
the probe delivers the samples to a lab.            

127
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,625
a technician first tests the moisture content    

128
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,494
to confirm that it's on target.             

129
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,364
he then transfers batches to a sifting bin         

130
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:48,500
to screen for bugs.       

131
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,503
he switches on a heat lamp to wake them up.         

132
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,907
he shakes the rice and scrutinizes.         

133
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,243
he also examines the tray underneath for tiny bugs     

134
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,512
that may have fallen through the holes.        

135
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,715
if he finds just one moth or beetle,            

136
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:08,053
the entire 5,500-pound truckload of rice will be rejected.    

137
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,457
next the rice falls through perforations           

138
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,059
in rolling cylinders,      

139
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,262
screening out the straw which spills over the side.   

140
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,933
the next machine sifts out the remaining straw bits   

141
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,935
and any weed seed.        

142
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,804
it also suctions out empty rice husks.        

143
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:30,075
they're lightweight and     
pulled out with a weak vacuum.  

144
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,112
finally, they remove mud balls.             

145
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:35,947
free of contaminants,      

146
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,884
the rice now spills between two rubber rollers,   

147
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,820
one moving faster than the other.      

148
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,557
this shears off the husks.    

149
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,962
the rice and empty husks then cascade into another machine.  

150
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:53,432
this is a demo version of the actual production one.  

151
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,770
weak suctioning pulls out the husks       

152
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,472
to separate them from the heavier rice.      

153
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,849
the dehusking process misses a few kernels,      

154
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:14,986
so next giant sifting machines screen out that rice.      

155
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,321
still in husks,         

156
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,657
it's bigger and doesn't pass through the holes        

157
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,659
in the shaking trays.      

158
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:24,063
they dehusk that rice and mix it with the rest.    

159
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:32,404
grinding machines now mill the rice to remove the bran.   

160
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,009
the bran spills out of perforations       

161
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:41,413
and is recovered for use in cattle feed.     

162
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:46,618
with the bran removed, the rice goes from brown to white.    

163
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,021
the final grinding polishes the rice             

164
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,722
to give it a pearly sheen.    

165
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,694
this is the unmilled brown rice.              

166
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,498
and here it is with the bran removed.      

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,569
during milling,         
some rice kernels are damaged.  

168
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:07,372
this spinning, dimpled cylinder now separates the broken kernels             

169
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,040
from the whole ones.       

170
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,310
the broken rice kernels fall into the dimples      

171
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:12,577
of the cylinder,         

172
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,848
and from there, into an internal catch pan.   

173
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,950
they'll be used to make cereal or beer.     

174
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:24,056
the whole rice now moves through a color sorter.  

175
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:27,526
computerized cameras analyze it for dark imperfections      

176
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:32,397
and signal air nozzles to blast them out of the mix.  

177
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,868
of course, there's also a market for unmilled brown rice.     

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,536
now ready for packaging,     

179
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,872
a scraper moves it across a table     

180
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,542
and into plastic tubes below.  

181
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,945
hot jaws seal the tubes at both ends,          

182
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,448
and this rice is in the bag.   

183
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,420
brown or white, short or medium grain,      

184
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,756
there are plenty of options.   

185
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,708
narrator: different types of rifles load the gun in different w 

186
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,779
a lever-action rifle has, as the name implies, a lever,  

187
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,381
which you move downwards to load the ammunition cartridge            

188
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,984
into the gun's chamber.     

189
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,719
when you pull the lever back up,               

190
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:32,791
it cocks the hammer and the gun is ready to fire.  

191
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,060
this italian company       

192
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,330
makes exact reproductions of the renowned winchesters   

193
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:43,001
produced in the u.s. starting in 1866.        

194
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,538
these lever-actions were a game-changer in that era,              

195
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,074
because you no longer had to reload your rifle     

196
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,677
one cartridge at a time.     

197
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,145
to make the barrel,       

198
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,748
the long tube through which the ammunition shoots,      

199
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,418
the factory starts with a bar of solid steel    

200
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,688
that's one inch in diameter.   

201
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,956
a computer-guided circular saw  

202
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,925
slices it into barrel-length pieces.    

203
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,900
next a computer-guided drill   

204
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,936
bores through the center of each barrel-length bar.    

205
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,440
the drill is fluted, which provides a channel     

206
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,577
for a continuous high-pressure flow of cutting oil.       

207
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,047
this breaks down the metal   
shavings as the drill advances  

208
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,316
from one end of the bar to the other     

209
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,485
over the course of five minutes.            

210
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,925
a reamer gradually widens the  
bore to the required diameter.  

211
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,594
this takes 15 minutes.      

212
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,929
the diameter of the barrel    

213
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,498
is what determines a firearm's caliber.       

214
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:55,006
a rifle gets its name from the next operation.     

215
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,343
this specialized tool rifles the barrel,        

216
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,113
meaning it carves spiraled grooves         

217
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,015
into the barrel bore's smooth walls.          

218
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,883
this process takes twice as long              

219
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,953
as drilling and reaming combined.      

220
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,090
the grooves in the barrel put a spin on the cartridge's bullet             

221
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,958
as it exits the gun.       

222
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,028
like the perfect pass of a football,          

223
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,897
this spin stabilizes the bullet,             

224
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,166
rendering it more aerodynamic.  

225
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:26,170
that makes the shot more    
accurate over a long distance.  

226
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,174
the next machine mills the outside of the barrel.    

227
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,044
this particular model has an octagonal barrel,     

228
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,379
so the machine mills eight sides.           

229
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,517
another machine then makes threads on the back end  

230
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,521
so the barrel can later screw into the adjacent part      

231
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:43,355
of the rifle.          

232
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:50,796
a local foundry, meanwhile, forges the rifle's lever.    

233
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:55,867
workers feed solid steel bars into a small furnace.      

234
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,536
the furnace temperature,     

235
00:13:57,538 --> 00:14:00,272
a blazing 2,200 degrees fahrenheit,           

236
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:03,475
softens the steel in a matter of seconds.     

237
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:06,144
while the bar is still red-hot,            

238
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:10,615
they place it in a die and stamp it with a press to bend it.   

239
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,426
then two more pressings in a different die        

240
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,963
form the bent bar into the basic shape of the lever.  

241
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,970
a fourth pressing,        

242
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,239
against a razor-sharp die this time,            

243
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,041
trims the perimeter.       

244
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,317
the roughly shaped lever     

245
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:49,721
is now ready for machining in the rifle factory.      

246
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,525
there, a computer-guided mill  
works at it for eight minutes.  

247
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,928
it meticulously shaves off bits of steel          

248
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,631
until the lever's shape is perfected.          

249
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,410
the mechanical section of the rifle is called the action.             

250
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,214
like the lever, it's forged out of a steel bar.              

251
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,349
then, over the course of an hour,           

252
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,419
it's machined to specifications         

253
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,588
by 100 different computer-guided tools.      

254
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,095
this operation not only finalizes        

255
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,497
the action's external shape,   

256
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,967
it also hollows out areas for the internal components,   

257
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,570
namely the rifle's lever-activated loading     

258
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,772
and firing mechanism.      

259
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,909
but before that assembly happens,             

260
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:47,846
the action takes a side trip to a metal treatment plant    

261
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:51,049
where it undergoes a two-step process.       

262
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,519
first it's submerged for three minutes in a hot-water bath   

263
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,789
with special salts which harden the steel.     

264
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,191
then a quick dip in a second bath,        

265
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:05,530
where a coloring chemical gives the steel an antique finish.   

266
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,199
the action now returns to the gun factory        

267
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,836
to rejoin the rifle's other components.        

268
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,152
narrator: the action is the middle section of the rifle.             

269
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,487
the barrel screws onto the front of it,      

270
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,290
while the gun's wooden handle attaches to the back of it.   

271
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,560
when you pull the trigger, the hammer hits the firing pin.              

272
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,095
this strikes the cartridge,   

273
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,830
igniting the explosive primer inside.   

274
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,569
the blast propels the bullet out of the barrel of the gun.  

275
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,238
to assemble the rifle's firing mechanism,  

276
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,976
workers first attach the trigger and the hammer spring      

277
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:53,445
to a larger component called the trigger guard.    

278
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,382
then they connect the hammer itself with a tight-fitting pin.              

279
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,584
the hammer spring provides resistance,       

280
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,321
allowing the hammer to hit the firing pin hard enough    

281
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,657
to fire the cartridge after it's cocked.        

282
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,592
taking the action,        

283
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,529
they insert the bolt containing the firing pin,    

284
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,532
then the firing pin extension.  

285
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,536
this wedge piece links those two components.      

286
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,210
they insert the trigger guard into the action,         

287
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,278
coaxing it into the correct position    

288
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,548
with a few taps of a mallet.   

289
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,552
they attach the lever underneath the trigger guard.  

290
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,690
they mount a spring on each side of the lever    

291
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,425
to put tension on it.      

292
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,899
then finally, they connect the lever to the firing mechanism  

293
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,101
with two sets of links.     

294
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,970
to cock the hammer and prepare to pull the trigger to fire,   

295
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,308
you pull down the lever, then pull it back up.      

296
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,844
after firing, you move the lever up and down again        

297
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,646
to eject the spent cartridge   

298
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:05,383
and reload and cock for the next shot.        

299
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,251
they finish assembling the action            

300
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,254
by attaching side plates,    

301
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,989
one of which has a side-loading gate     

302
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:13,658
for inserting the cartridges.  

303
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,860
the action has two threaded holes --    

304
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:20,131
one for attaching the magazine to that holds the cartridges   

305
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,534
and the other for attaching the barrel.    

306
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,536
its threaded end requires some top filing     

307
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,139
in order to meet the various strict specifications      

308
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,141
set out by the proofhouse.    

309
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:34,012
the proofhouse is responsible for ensuring that firearms    

310
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:37,148
conform to           
all manufacturing regulations.  

311
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,284
to attach the barrel to the action,          

312
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,286
they lock the barrel in a vise,              

313
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,955
then screw the action on to the threaded end.     

314
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,693
they use various tools and gauges            

315
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,896
to ensure the two parts are perfectly aligned      

316
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:55,033
and that the lever closes completely when pulled up.    

317
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,304
next they insert what's called a check cartridge        

318
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,708
of the appropriate caliber into the chamber.        

319
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,643
this checks the internal spacing             

320
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:11,249
to ensure the ammunition feeds correctly and fires safely.   

321
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,817
then they mount a temporary stock        

322
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,519
on the other end of the action  

323
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,520
and send the rifle to the proofhouse        

324
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,524
for performance and safety testing.       

325
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,927
there, technicians place it in an enclosed chamber,            

326
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,798
load ammunition, and fire twice.         

327
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,474
the proofhouse hand-punches markings      

328
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,544
onto the bottom of the rifle.  

329
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:43,681
these markings, recognized by the european economic community,           

330
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,216
officially certify        

331
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,053
that the firearm        
functions properly and safely.  

332
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,361
the gun factory contracts a woodworking company      

333
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,430
to produce the rifle's stock.  

334
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,634
it's made from a block of walnut.            

335
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,503
first workers trace a template  

336
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,806
that's in the basic shape of the stock.          

337
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,713
they saw along the trace line.  

338
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,456
this gives them a starting form,              

339
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,826
which computer-guided machines then refine.           

340
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,665
a mill progressively carves the detailed profile   

341
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,967
with a series of different tools.       

342
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,273
then they mount the stock on a lathe,           

343
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,875
which rotates it against a sander         

344
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,778
to smooth the surface and perfect the shape.      

345
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,218
the stock has two holes in the back           

346
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,220
to which they attach an endpiece.           

347
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,757
the woodshop stains and varnishes the finished stock              

348
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,693
and sends it to the gun factory,            

349
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,228
where workers attach it to the action.          

350
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,499
after that, they mount the magazine tube to the action.             

351
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,302
when you feed cartridges into the side-loading gate,   

352
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,504
they drop into the magazine tube.        

353
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,106
upon levering the rifle,     

354
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,241
a carrier pushes up one cartridge,     

355
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,844
which the bolt then pushes into the chamber,  

356
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:22,180
preparing the rifle to fire.   

357
