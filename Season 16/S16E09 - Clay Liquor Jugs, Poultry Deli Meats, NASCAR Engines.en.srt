now the distributor.            
it sends electricity from the   
alternator-charged car battery  

501
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,358
it sends electricity from the   
alternator-charged car battery  
to the spark plugs.             

502
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,093
alternator-charged car battery  
to the spark plugs.             
the spark plugs fire, igniting  

503
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,828
to the spark plugs.             
the spark plugs fire, igniting  
the fuel and air mixture in each

504
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,329
the spark plugs fire, igniting  
the fuel and air mixture in each
cylinder, producing a mini      

505
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,764
the fuel and air mixture in each
cylinder, producing a mini      
explosion that drives the       

506
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,899
cylinder, producing a mini      
explosion that drives the       
piston.                         

507
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,901

this component, the intake      
manifold, feeds the air and fuel
mixture to the cylinder intake  

510
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,573
manifold, feeds the air and fuel
mixture to the cylinder intake  
valves.

the carburetor regulates the    
mixture ratio by metering the   

513
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,512
the carburetor regulates the    
mixture ratio by metering the   
right amount of fuel to the     

514
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,913
mixture ratio by metering the   
right amount of fuel to the     
amount of air coming in.        

515
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,782
right amount of fuel to the     
amount of air coming in.        
technicians install the numerous

516
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:51,088
amount of air coming in.        
technicians install the numerous
parts that make up the clutch.  

517
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,257
technicians install the numerous
parts that make up the clutch.  
next, the starter ring, which   

518
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,959
parts that make up the clutch.  
next, the starter ring, which   
engages with the starter to fire

519
00:19:54,961 --> 00:20:00,297
next, the starter ring, which   
engages with the starter to fire
up the engine.

00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,866
engages with the starter to fire
up the engine.                  
finally, they mount the bell    

521
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,868
up the engine.                  
finally, they mount the bell    
housing, a cover that protects  

522
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,770
finally, they mount the bell    
housing, a cover that protects  
the clutch from debris and      

523

the machine starts up and runs  

527
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,890
the motor, analyzing some 300   

528

shooting from different angles  

534
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,235
enable technicians to zoom in   

535
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,003
and view on a monitor anything  

536
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:44,576
they need to visually inspect.  

537
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,310
all this to ensure the engine   

538
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:47,645
they've built will have a
