they wire the pump so they can

provides the required pressure. 
they wire the pump so they can  
later connect it to the

forklift's battery.             

146
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,810
later connect it to the

00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,912
forklift's battery.             
they nudge the pump into its    
permanent position and bolt it

into place.                     
it both activates and brakes the

to move the truck and a load of 

158
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:55,673

159
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,442
to move the truck and a load of 
2.2 tons safely.                
they check the oil and install a

00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:14,360
the handle is then connected to 
a computerized system that      
operates both the vehicle and

00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,164
operates both the vehicle and   
its hydraulic lift.             
they slide the steering wheel

they slide the steering wheel   
onto a shaft and make sure it's 

166
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,267
they slide the steering wheel   
onto a shaft and make sure it's 
solidly attached.               

167
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,036
onto a shaft and make sure it's 
solidly attached.               
production then hits a turning  

168
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,838
solidly attached.               
production then hits a turning  
point as they power up the motor

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,506
production then hits a turning  
point as they power up the motor
and check the steering wheel    

170
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:34,312
point as they power up the motor
and check the steering wheel    
installation.                   

171
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,981
and check the steering wheel    
installation.                   
they flush filtered oil through 

172
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,982
installation.                   
they flush filtered oil through

00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,264
the hydraulics.                 
they test the computerized      
controls for the lift and motor.

mainframe above them.           
this makes it easier to slide   
the inner rails onto the frame,

00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:11,516
and later, the grease will also 
improve the function of this
