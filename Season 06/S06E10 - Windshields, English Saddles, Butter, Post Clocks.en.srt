00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,225
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,726
         windshields...         

5
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,899
      ...english saddles...     

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,738
          ...butter...          

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,210
       ...and post clocks.      

8
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,720
  drivers of the earliest cars  

9
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,522
had only goggles to shield them.

10
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,523
      so, to protect people     
       from the elements,       

11
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,727
      the glass windshield      
      was invented in 1904.     

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,395
    but there was a danger --   

13
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,331
  they would shatter on impact, 
        injuring people.        

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,600
        glass lamination        
       solved the problem.      

15
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,171
     it was shatterproof --     
 a real scientific breakthrough.

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,811
to make a windshield, they start
  with a plain sheet of glass.  

17
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,347
      an automated plotter      
 moves a cutting wheel over it, 

18
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,549
 and the wheel scores the glass.

19
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,619
        now a robotic arm       
       brandishes a torch.      

20
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,488
 it moves along the score line, 

21
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,090
      and the thermal shock     
       completes the cut.       

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,694
      this is the best way      
  to cleanly cut through glass. 

23
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,899
    next, a robot suctions up   
     the cut piece of glass     

24
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,168
        and transfers it        
      to the next station,      

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,970
    where it pushes the glass   

26
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,905
             against            
   a series of sanding belts.   

27
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:51,510
 this takes off the sharp edges.
      it's called seaming.      

28
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:57,182
 now a conveyor belt takes the  
 glass through some soapy water 

29
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,816
         to clean it up.        

30
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,719
  then nozzles spray the glass  

31
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,322
           with a mix           
   of talcum powder and water.  

32
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,656
   this will prevent the glass  

33
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,725
          from sticking         
   to a second sheet of glass.  

34
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,261
        a robot now sets        
   that second piece of glass   

35
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,598
             on top             
   of the freshly sprayed one.  

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,200
this is a temporary arrangement.

37
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,070
     the two sheets of glass    
   are layered for processing   

38
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,172
 but will be pulled apart later.

39
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,884
              next,             
  they silk-screen black paint  

40
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,219
 around the border of the glass 
     that will eventually be    

41
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,422
         the inner part         
       of the windshield.       

42
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,892
       then automated arms      
         carry the glass        

43
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:44,295
   to a station where samples   
     are inspected visually.    

44
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,831
           after that,          
   rollers transfer the glass   

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,435
  to automatic squaring pucks,  
      which position them.      

46
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,637
        and then a robot        
    lifts the sheets of glass   

47
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,240
        and carries them        
       to four metal pins.      

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,648
 the pins recede, and the glass 
   falls onto a bending iron.   

49
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,952
       the iron is shaped       
   like a specific windshield.  

50
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,991
 the conveyor takes the bending 
 iron with the two glass sheets 

51
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,661
          into an oven          
     called a bending lehr.     

52
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,462
 the lehr heats the glass sheets

53
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,932
            to almost           
    1,400 degrees fahrenheit,   

54
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,468
 causing the glass to sink into 
 the shape of the bending iron. 

55
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,938
   then the glass goes through  
      a slow cooling cycle      

56
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,409
     to anneal, or toughen,     
         the new shape.         

57
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,877
     next, a robot picks up     
        a sheet of vinyl        

58
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,013
        cut in the shape        
        of a windshield.        

59
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,815
    it takes the vinyl sheet    

60
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,750
   to one of the newly shaped   
        pieces of glass,        

61
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,086
         just separated         
      from the other piece.     

62
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,623
 then another robot lowers the  
 other identical piece of glass 

63
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,157
         onto the vinyl.        

64
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,027
     and that's the formula     
     for glass lamination --    

65
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:53,898
    two layers of glass with    
 a piece of vinyl between them. 

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,833
  in the event of an accident,  

67
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,437
  the windshield will fracture  
     but not totally shatter    

68
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,241
because the vinyl will hold most
  of the broken glass together. 

69
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,311
       but, at this point,      

70
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,914
      there's no clear view     
 through that milky-white vinyl.

71
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,582
    that's why the windshield   

72
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:14,719
            is headed           
  to a machine called a nipper. 

73
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,788
       the nipper presses       
         the windshield         

74
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,923
             between            
   a series of rubber rollers,  

75
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,059
squeezing out air pockets in it.

76
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,594
     as the air is removed,     

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,463
   the view through the vinyl   
       gets a bit clearer.      

78
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,600
       now squaring pucks       
    position the windshield,    

79
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,237
   and a robot sticks brackets  
for the rearview mirror onto it.

80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,274
      this big blue chamber     
        is an autoclave.        

81
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,009
  it's like a pressure cooker.  

82
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,678
  after about an hour in there, 

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,481
    any remaining air pockets   
 in the windshield are removed. 

84
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,751
    a rail system transports    
    the tubful of windshields   

85
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,487
   to the inspection station.   

86
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,154
 here, each windshield undergoes

87
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,624
      a close-up inspection     
           by a human.          

88
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,760
           he searches          
      for scratches, chips,     

89
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,397
  or any contamination between  
  the glass and vinyl layers.   

90
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,036
         now they place         
      a 5-pound steel ball      

91
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,374
      into a pulley system      
  that raises it 13 feet high.  

92
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,978
    yes, this is a crash test   
    for a sample windshield.    

93
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,681
       the ball represents      
        a driver's head.        

94
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,652
     the ball hits the glass    
     but doesn't go through,    

95
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,189
   which means the windshield   
   has passed the safety test.  

96
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,461
  now they view the windshield  
    through polarized light,    

97
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,130
  which reveals stress defects. 

98
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,333
     but only a trained eye     
         can spot them.         

99
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,536
        once it's decided       
   that everything looks good,  

100
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,204
   the shatterproof windshield  

101
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,442
    is ready to be installed    
    in today's automobiles.     

102
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,760
     narrator: saddle-making    
  goes back thousands of years. 

103
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,496
      but in modern times,      
   saddle makers have realized  

104
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,965
    that a bad-fitting saddle   
     can irritate the horse.    

105
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,701
    an experienced rider will   
  undoubtedly feel a difference 

106
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,303
    in the animal's attitude    
        and performance.        

107
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,706
             so now             
  saddles are often custom-made 

108
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,641
      to fit both the horse     
         and the rider.         

109
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,914
   to make an english saddle,   

110
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,716
     they attach both rigid     
    and flexible steel strips   

111
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,588
to a frame made of polyurethane,
     which is called a tree.    

112
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,591
  then they rivet a stirrup bar 
        through the tree        

113
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,762
  to the steel that's just been 
   fastened to the underside.   

114
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,069
         with a jigsaw,         
a worker cuts a hole in the tree

115
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,238
       and then glues foam      
         for cushioning.        

116
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,544
    now he coats the back of    
 the cantle, or seat, with glue 

117
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,913
  and sticks a piece of leather 
            onto it.            

118
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,086
      he crimps the leather     
  around the edges of the tree. 

119
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,289
    and, using a special tool   
      for cutting leather,      

120
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,824
     called a clicker knife,    

121
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,027
         he carves away         
       the extra material.      

122
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,030
       then he sprays glue      
    onto the top of the tree    

123
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,298
   and presses a layer of foam  
            onto it.            

124
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
using an ordinary kitchen knife,

125
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,970
   he slices away excess foam   
          at the sides          

126
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,706
    and carves out more foam    
       to shape the seat.       

127
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,912
    then he shaves the edges    
          with a rasp.          

128
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,115
         next, he layers        
  two more foam pieces over it  

129
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,752
     and sculpts and shaves     
          those layers.         

130
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,393
he runs a measuring stick along 
the seat to make sure it's even,

131
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,795
         and then pastes        
  a piece of black foam on top  

132
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,864
  to add even more cushioning.  

133
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,601
  now, with a half-moon blade,  

134
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,139
another worker slices a piece of
 leather to make a saddle flap. 

135
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,008
     she follows a trace-out    
       of the rider's leg.      

136
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,111
    she feeds the flap piece    
    into a skiving machine.     

137
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,081
    its circular blade shaves   
    the edges of the leather    

138
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,816
  as a wheel pulls it through.  

139
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,619
      the thinned-out edges     
 will be easier to sew later on.

140
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,894
      next, she heat-stamps     
 the saddle logo onto the flap. 

141
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,963
   she also stamps the model,   
         serial number,         

142
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,900
       tree, and seat size      
        onto the saddle.        

143
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,637
       now she glues foam       
   to a hard piece of leather   

144
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,974
  to make a kneepad and sticks  
   softer leather on the top,   

145
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,976
     where the rider's knee     
           will rest.           

146
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,244
           then, using          
     a piece of whale bone,     

147
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,513
   she draws the leather tight  
        around the edges        

148
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,715
   so that it's smooth on top.  

149
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,286
  whale bone is used because it 
doesn't scar or scratch leather.

150
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,725
 next, she seals the front edges
 and then crimps them together, 

151
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,494
     the way a baker crimps     
       the edges of a pie.      

152
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,067
   she pulls the leather tight  
       from the back side       

153
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,470
         and paints glue        
      onto the fatter rim.      

154
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,741
      then she brushes glue     
          onto the flap         

155
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:07,145
and presses the kneepad and flap
  together so the glue sticks.  

156
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,948
        she hammers them        
     to strengthen the bond,    

157
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,084
  then stitches them together,  
      along that glue line,     

158
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,887
           using a big          
   industrial sewing machine.   

159
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,828
  with a steel prod, she stuffs 
  a wool-and-synthetic mixture  

160
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,898
  into the panel which will be  
      on the horse's back.      

161
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,567
       it's being stuffed       
  with a certain horse in mind. 

162
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,369
   the amount of stuffing used  

163
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,171
             depends            
    on the shape of the horse   

164
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,106
  the saddle is being made for. 

165
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,111
      she hammers it flat       
      with a rubber mallet      

166
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,247
   and then stitches the panel  
    to the top of the saddle.   

167
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,517
         to sew through         
       the leather layers,      

168
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,385
  she makes a hole with an awl  

169
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,520
    and then pulls the needle   
     and thread through it,     

170
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,990
         spraying water         
    to keep the leather soft.   

171
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,062
 she hammers the seam to get rid
 of any gaps between the layers.

172
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,998
but sewing the back of the panel
    to the bottom of the seat   

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,466
       is a bit trickier.       

174
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:05,070
she uses a curved awl and needle
   to work with the contours.   

175
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,008
    it's taken about 25 hours   

176
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,345
        to piece together       
 this customized english saddle.

177
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,619
 this is the saddletech device, 

178
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,022
  and they use it to make sure  
     the saddle measures up.    

179
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,358
it measures it in four sections.

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,827
now it's on to the tree machine.

181
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,428
  it adjusts the gullet plate,  

182
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,498
  the piece of rigid steel that 
 sits above the horse's withers.

183
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,768
         plastic panels         
       support the saddle       

184
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,036
     while a hydraulic press    
         bends the plate        

185
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,772
     to fit the measurement.    

186
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,976
   now it's time to saddle up   

187
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,046
        and check the fit       
    of this custom-made seat.   

188
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,598
            narrator:           
   butter has a rich history.   

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,867
the ancient romans used it as a 
beauty cream and to treat burns.

190
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,936
     even the old testament     
        mentions butter.        

191
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,271
  abraham served it to angels.  

192
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,607
  back then, people made butter 

193
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:19,210
   by shaking milk in bags of   
 animal skin or in hollow logs. 

194
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,113
      today it's a product      
      of modern technology.     

195
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,218
      butter-making begins      

196
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,687
  with a tanker-truck delivery  
         to the dairy --        

197
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,824
      almost 8,000 gallons      
       of raw cow's milk.       

198
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,827
         workers test it        
  for consistent color and odor 

199
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,163
       before unloading it      
  through vacuum-pumped hoses.  

200
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,233
   they pump the raw milk into  
  a machine called a separator. 

201
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,768
      the separator spins,      

202
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,705
  dividing the raw milk's fat   
  from the rest of the liquid.  

203
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:51,042
 the fat is called buttercream, 
   and the rest is skim milk.   

204
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,779
    the essential ingredient    
  in butter is the buttercream. 

205
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,016
     it's thick, off-white,     
   and approximately 38% fat.   

206
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,054
some of it goes to make 2% milk.

207
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,922
    a worker adjusts a valve    

208
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,859
          to re-insert          
    some into the skim milk.    

209
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,262
    the resulting 2% milk is    
  more watery than buttercream  

210
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,731
          and is white.         

211
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,268
    the less the fat content,   

212
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,738
     the thinner and runnier    
          the milk is.          

213
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,745
   back to the butter-making.   

214
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,548
    they put the buttercream    
  in what's called a bulk tank, 

215
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,285
      where mixers stir it      
  to maintain the consistency.  

216
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,620
       after pasteurizing       

217
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,422
 and then aging the buttercream 
          for 24 hours,         

218
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,958
 workers prepare to transfer it 
       to another machine,      

219
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,895
       called the churner.      

220
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,496
   first they clean the inside  

221
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,098
          by filling it         
  with water mixed with iodine. 

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,036
   this removes any germs left  
  behind by the previous batch. 

223
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,172
     they spin the churner      
     for about five minutes     

224
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,740
     before rinsing it out.     

225
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,913
  next, they pour in just under 
   400 gallons of buttercream,  

226
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,981
       filling the churner      
         about halfway.         

227
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,683
         it's important         
       to leave some room       

228
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,252
      so that air released      
     in the churning process    

229
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,722
  can escape through two vents  
         in the churner.        

230
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,891
        the churner spins       
  at 28 rotations per minute -- 

231
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,993
         about the speed        
       of a clothes dryer.      

232
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,530
  this causes the buttercream's 
fat molecules to bunch together,

233
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,466
    releasing water and air.    

234
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,335
       every five minutes,      
   a worker stops the churner   

235
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,404
   and regulates the air vent   
             on top.            

236
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,873
          when he feels         
  there's no more air escaping, 

237
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,810
       he closes the valve      
   and re-starts the machine.   

238
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,214
  after 30 minutes of churning, 

239
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,150
       the fat molecules        
       in the buttercream       

240
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,686
        are creamy clumps       
    known as popcorn butter.    

241
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,755
    these clumps stay trapped   
         in the churner,        

242
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,024
  while the remaining liquid -- 
      called buttermilk --      

243
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,993
flows out a drain at the bottom.

244
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,164
      a vacuum-pump system      

245
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,766
     sends it through hoses     
     to a nearby container.     

246
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,569
     this draining process      
     takes about 10 minutes     

247
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,039
          and produces          
about 210 gallons of buttermilk.

248
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,977
 this dairy uses the buttermilk 
       to make ice cream.       

249
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,713
      the popcorn butter --     
    all 1,500 pounds of it --   

250
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,447
    has the same consistency    

251
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,718
      as a regular butter       
      at room temperature.      

252
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,388
     a worker now flavors it    
     with 30 pounds of salt.    

253
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,391
      this dairy also makes     
        unsalted butter.        

254
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,131
  the worker closes the churner 
   by sealing the glass window  

255
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,467
       with a rubber ring       
       and a metal collar.      

256
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,702
           this keeps           
    the internal air pressure   

257
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,405
          roughly equal         
 to what's outside the churner. 

258
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,775
       doing this ensures       
 the churner works efficiently. 

259
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,483
 another 30 minutes of churning,

260
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,685
      and the fat molecules     
        thicken even more       

261
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,554
    and blend with the salt.    

262
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,422
     what results is butter,    

263
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,093
     which is yellow because    
    of its natural vitamin a.   

264
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,962
      next, a worker scoops     
    about 66 pounds of butter   

265
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,564
     into a milling machine.    

266
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,836
    the mill moves the butter   
into the final production phase,

267
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,507
     where it'll be shaped      
     and put into packages.     

268
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,309
  this machine squeezes butter  

269
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,711
        into an injector        
   that's shaped like a block.  

270
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,681
   the injector then deposits   
        blocks of butter        

271
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,117
       into open packages.      

272
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,120
       the packaging paper      
 has an aluminum outer coating. 

273
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,254
       this prevents light      
        from penetrating.       

274
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,790
    light can make the butter   
             rancid.            

275
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:31,195
each sheet is 10 1/2 inches long
     and 7 1/2 inches wide.     

276
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,398
 before the butter is inserted, 

277
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
        a plastic former        
   bends the paper into shape.  

278
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,670
       this mill operates       
       four days a week,        

279
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,205
     making up to 33 blocks     
           per minute.          

280
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,342
 that's a fairly small quantity 
    compared to some dairies,   

281
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:48,413
  but this relatively slow pace 
 allows greater quality control.

282
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,552
to monitor the mill's precision,
 workers check every 15th block 

283
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:58,222
            to ensure           
  it weighs exactly one pound.  

284
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,092
 the dairy then ships the butter
            to stores           

285
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,961
     in refrigerated trucks.    

286
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,971
narrator: clocks on posts became
popular fixtures in town squares

287
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,706
        during the 1800s.       

288
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,575
  railways were spreading fast, 
     and these public clocks    

289
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,977
          helped people         
 to get to their trains on time.

290
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,113
       today, post clocks       
       are often designed       

291
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,848
          to look like          
     they're from the past.     

292
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,250
       but the technology       
   that goes into making them   

293
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,619
  is actually very up-to-date.  

294
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,125
it all starts with what's called
        a transfer sheet.       

295
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,928
      a worker positions it     
      over an aluminum disc     

296
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,862
that'll become the clock's dial.

297
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,466
she removes the sheet, sprays on
a chemical, and repositions it. 

298
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,936
          the chemical          
  will act as a release agent,  

299
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,205
   detaching the vinyl numbers  
         from the sheet         

300
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,874
     so that they transfer      
     and stick to the dial.     

301
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,043
  she then peels the sheet off. 

302
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,815
      this worker prepares      
     a more elaborate model,    

303
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,652
          with numerals         
     in 23-karat gold leaf.     

304
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,354
   after coating them in glue,  

305
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,690
           she applies          
   a hair-thin sheet of gold.   

306
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,128
then she gently brushes the gold
        onto the numeral.       

307
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,765
 using a computer-guided cutter,

308
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,168
  workers cut a 1/5-inch-thick  
        sheet of aluminum       

309
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,371
       into a clock's hand      
  that's more than 3 feet long. 

310
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,045
  to boost the hand's rigidity, 
   they crease it in a press.   

311
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,648
  this structurally reinforces  
           the metal,           

312
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,317
 helping retain the hand's shape
           over time.           

313
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,125
   a 1 1/2-ounce counterweight  
      will balance the hand     

314
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,894
        when it rotates.        

315
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,663
 here, a welder builds the post 

316
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,001
  by fusing a base and a column 
     made of cast aluminum.     

317
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:54,138
on another model, workers attach
the housing for the clock head. 

318
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,541
this clock will have four dials.

319
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,143
     other models have two.     

320
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,811
       in the paint shop,       

321
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,348
 workers give the base, column, 
 and head four coats of paint.  

322
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,489
  after applying some lubricant 
on a steel shaft, called a stud,

323
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,293
    a worker installs one of    
the clock's eight brass gears --

324
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,761
         brass, because         
    it's strong and durable.    

325
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,432
 a steel loop called a snap ring
    holds each gear in place.   

326
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,300
          one gear has          
      what's called a vane      

327
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,536
           to regulate          
    the pulsing of the gears.   

328
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,840
     next, a worker attaches    
       the shaft and gear       

329
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,842
that'll control the minute hand.

330
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,644
   altogether, the gears form   

331
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,746
          what's called         
       the clock movement.      

332
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,919
   he screws on a brass panel   
       called a backplate       

333
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,189
   to hold the clock movement   
            in place.           

334
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,658
        then he attaches        
   an electronic circuit board  

335
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,995
 that'll later connect the clock
 movement to another component. 

336
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,264
  he installs a 115-volt motor  

337
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,133
            to supply           
   the clock's electric power.  

338
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,637
finally, he connects power wires
and turns on the clock movement.

339
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,341
 here, he's checking to see that
  everything's properly linked  

340
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,410
       and that the gears       
        are moving well.        

341
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,081
          this company          
      makes clock movements     

342
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,683
 for clocks ranging in diameter 

343
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,354
     from just 8 1/2 inches     
     to more than 70 feet.      

344
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:21,692
 the gears in the largest clock 
   are nearly 3 1/2 feet wide.  

345
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:25,362
 here, you can see how the shaft
  that'll hold the minute hand  

346
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,166
  revolves inside what's called 
  the sleeve of the hour hand.  

347
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,168
       a worker attaches        
       the clock movement       

348
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,703
    to the back of the dial.    

349
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,574
   then he ties wires through   
 what's called glass standoffs. 

350
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,177
   these standoffs will cradle  
     the clock's neon light.    

351
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,313
     the neon tube encircles    
     the clock's perimeter.     

352
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,914
    it attaches through holes   

353
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,785
        to a transformer        
     hidden behind the dial.    

354
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:52,856
    he fastens the tube with    
  rust-resistant copper wires.  

355
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,526
  next come the hour and minute 
    hands, now painted black.   

356
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,262
     he uses an allen wrench    

357
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,598
         to attach them         
 to what's called the hand hub. 

358
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,867
    this hub holds the hands    
          on the shaft          

359
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,802
           that's part          
     of the clock movement.     

360
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,674
       the assembled dial       
    now goes into its casing.   

361
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,409
   the casing has two parts --  

362
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,278
        an aluminum ring,       
         called a bezel,        

363
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,347
      around a glass cover      
      known as a crystal.       

364
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,550
       he connects a wire       
       to link the dials        

365
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,352
  so that they'll move in sync. 

366
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,487
           the worker           
    then inserts this casing    

367
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,890
        into what will be       
     a two-dial post clock.     

368
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,960
      workers then turn on      
the neon clock light to test it.

369
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,895
once the post clock's installed,

370
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,298
        a built-in sensor       
   turns the light on at dusk   

371
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100
        and off at dawn.        

372
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,170
      inside every clock is     
a controller that sets the time.

373
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,571
   it's linked to a satellite   

374
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,572
             through            
  a global positioning system.  

375
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,108
   the gps tells the satellite  
    where the clock's located   

376
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,978
 to set the correct local time. 

377
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,513
       after starting up,       
the controller takes six minutes

378
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,648
       to adjust the hands      
       to the exact time,       

379
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,050
       which is determined      

380
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,853
 by an international observatory
     in greenwich, england.     

381
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,122
          certainly not         
   your average pocket watch,   

382
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,857
   this company's post clocks   

383
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:06,597
can stand more than 19 feet high
     and cost up to $35,000.    

384
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,938
    if you have any comments    
         about the show         

385
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,541
   or if you'd like to suggest  
    topics for future shows,
