narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

3
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,725
co2 cartridges...       

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,765
...pretzels...         

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,203
...scissor lifts...      

6
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,144
...and skating rinks.     

7
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,585
sports like paintball are a pressure release       

8
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:54,853
in more ways than one.     

9
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,123
paintball guns contain pressurized co2 cartridges,  

10
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,792
and when the gas is released, 

11
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:02,727
the force propels the ammunition
towards its target.      

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,195
the cartridges are used also  

13
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,065
for things like inflating bike tires and life preservers,

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,402
as they target new uses for these pressure-filled devices. 

15
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,810
a co2 cartridge packs a lot of punch into a little package.

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,548
this one can propel dozens of shots.           

17
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,086
to make one, they unroll some steel and straighten it out.  

18
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,090
then, a punch press descends with 110 tons of force,    

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,493
cutting the steel into disks. 

20
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,695
simultaneously, a machine moves up from below 

21
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,032
to shape the disks into cups. 

22
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,771
the cups move down a vibrating lane.        

23
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,907
they're delivered to a series of cylindrical punches,    

24
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,744
each one with a smaller diameter
than the last.         

25
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,917
each successive punch lengthens
and narrows the cups      

26
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,187
as nozzles flush them with lubricant.        

27
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,922
the process is called redrawing,

28
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:08,393
and at the end of it, the cups look more like test tubes.   

29
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,273
in just a few minutes, that piece of steel      

30
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,176
has undergone several transformations.    

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,951
to continue shaping the tubes, 

32
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,755
they heat the ends by dropping them through an induction coil.

33
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,758
intense magnetic fields excite the molecules in the metal,  

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,060
causing it to heat up sharply. 

35
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,665
this machine is called a necker.

36
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,966
as it revolves,        

37
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,036
it delivers the tubes to a series of dies      

38
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,638
that pinch their ends.     

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,442
with each pinch, the ends get progressively smaller.     

40
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,512
this creates necks in the tubes.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,254
as the diameter of the neck narrows,      

42
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,090
the tube takes the shape of a bottle.          

43
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,396
now each cartridge goes on a lathe.          

44
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,332
a cutting tool plunge-cuts the neck to shorten it.    

45
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,933
then it carves out a lip,   

46
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,770
the same kind of lip that's on any beverage bottle. 

47
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,347
the cartridges now head through
a washing station,       

48
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,183
where soap and water get rid of the oily lubricant.     

49
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,323
a trip under some gas burners dries them off,        

50
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,159
and they head to the filling station.    

51
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,330
here there's a tankful of carbon dioxide.       

52
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,370
the filling head pumps liquid co2 into the cartridges 

53
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,339
and then caps them.      

54
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,445
inside these cartridges,    

55
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:10,015
the gaseous form of co2 is under
great pressure.        

56
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,317
releasing even just a little through a gun         

57
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,586
will be enough to propel things
like bbs, pellets,       

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,723
and paintballs.        

59
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,124
they do spot checks      

60
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,027
to make sure the cartridges are tightly sealed.      

61
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,810
now it's on to the next station,

62
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,813
where they'll be made to look shiny and new.     

63
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,885
the cartridges are inside this revolving drum,      

64
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,620
which delivers an electrical charge,     

65
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,157
attracting zinc from the tank to plate the cartridges.    

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,901
the smooth zinc plating doesn't
just look good.        

67
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,238
it's a better surface to print information on.    

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,644
at this rotary silk-screening station,    

69
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,046
the brand name and cautionary information   

70
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,350
are printed onto the sides of the cartridges.       

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:30,295
a quick bake under an     
ultraviolet light cures the ink.

72
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,869
and the co2 cartridges are now ready         

73
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,173
to demonstrate the power of compression.        

74
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,023
narrator: how and when the first pretzel came to be  

75
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,959
depends on whom you ask.    

76
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,428
one story tells of a monk baking rewards         

77
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,163
for children who were pious.  

78
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,298
today's bakeries still fold the dough      

79
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,367
to resemble arms crossed in prayer,           

80
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,503
but they do it much faster,  

81
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,740
granting tasty wishes to a lot more snackers.    

82
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,982
although hard pretzels are more common,        

83
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,385
this company makes the more traditional soft-baked ones.  

84
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,655
to make enough dough for 4,870 pretzels,       

85
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,925
a workers first blends shortening, sugar, and salt  

86
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,861
in a huge mixer.        

87
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,866
the machine automatically adds yeast...         

88
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,934
corn syrup...         

89
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,738
1,630 gallons of cold water.. 

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,808
and 760 pounds of flour.    

91
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,610
the cold water helps make the dough elastic     

92
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,781
so workers can shape it before it hardens.       

93
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,620
a worker then opens the mixer and slows the blades      

94
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,523
to help the dough fall out.  

95
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,300
he splits the batch on a table,
then creates chunks      

96
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,969
that go into a tank called a hopper.        

97
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,772
it feeds an auger that challenges the dough chunks  

98
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,573
through little guillotines.  

99
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,309
the blades chop the chunks   

100
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,844
into 2 1/2 ounce balls to make small pretzels     

101
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,115
or 5 ounce balls for large pretzels.      

102
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,184
two conveyer belts squeeze them

103
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:36,488
into 15 1/2 inch long segments called noodles.        

104
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,932
another machine now grabs the ends of each noodle    

105
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,934
and twists the ends over each other        

106
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,604
to create the pretzel's three signature holes.     

107
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,742
to keep this knot from unraveling,        

108
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,144
the plate then gently flips the pretzel dough       

109
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,947
onto another plate below.   

110
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,551
that plate carefully flips the doughy creations      

111
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,621
onto a 118-foot long conveyer belt.         

112
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:16,094
the raw pretzels now travel on the conveyer for 14 minutes,

113
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,297
the time it takes for the dough to rise.     

114
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,380
next, they move through showers
of liquid sodium hydroxide,  

115
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,782
heated to 180 degrees fahrenheit.          

116
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,584
that seals in the moisture   

117
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,420
so the pretzel will be chewy when you eat it.        

118
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,394
they go into an oven that's about the length of a city bus.

119
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,932
as they enter, flames sear and harden the outside.    

120
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,333
this prevents the bottoms   

121
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,803
from sticking to the mesh conveyer belt during baking.  

122
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:04,141
after about 3 1/2 minutes at 560 degrees fahrenheit,   

123
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,477
the pretzels are piping hot and golden brown.       

124
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,213
they drop onto a long conveyer,

125
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,548
where they gradually cool   

126
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,484
on their way to the next step --
a trip through a freezer    

127
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,888
that's longer than seven olympic-size swimming pools.  

128
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,027
after 30 minutes at minus-28 degrees celsius,  

129
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,096
the pretzels are rock solid and ready for packaging,    

130
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,632
but first, a camera scans them 

131
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,968
so that a computer can track each pretzel          

132
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,272
and guide a robotic arm to pick it up.         

133
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,776
this arm is one of five operating       

134
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,446
at separate points on the line.

135
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,250
the robots process one pretzel per second           

136
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,087
and clean up after each other until the belt is picked clean.

137
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,194
the pretzels then fall through a sliding gate,        

138
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:00,599
landing on a conveyer that whisks them off to the next step.             

139
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,900
there, a machine drops a packet
of coarse salt         

140
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,802
into each bin of six pretzels. 

141
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,005
a mechanical arm nudges the pretzels over       

142
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,472
to make room for it.      

143
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,943
the salt packet lets you season 
your pretzel the traditional way

144
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,545
before warming it up at home. 

145
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,016
the machine blows open plastic bags with compressed air.   

146
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:22,187
mechanical arms push the    
pretzels and salt packet inside.

147
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:38,536
a robot arm then places each bag
into a cardboard box.     

148
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,974
the printing on this package displays the company logo,   

149
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,444
the nutritional content, the production date,      

150
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,379
and the heating instructions. 

151
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,781
so, next time you're looking for a salty snack,       

152
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,717
don't tie yourself up in knots.

153
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,253
just have a pretzel instead.  

154
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,930
narrator: a scissor lift is a 
mobile work platform that rises.

155
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,066
the elevating mechanism consists
of arms            

156
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,202
that connect in the middle like scissors, hence the name. 

157
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,938
scissor lifts are common sight on construction sites,     

158
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,073
in big warehouses,       

159
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,275
and at buildings where workers need a safe way        

160
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,211
to reach heights to carry out repairs or maintenance.    

161
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,819
the number of arms in the scissor mechanism    

162
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:32,090
varies according to the height of each particular model.   

163
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,159
the factory constructs the scissor arms from steel tubes. 

164
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,761
the first step is to cut them 

165
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,097
to the right length for the model in production.  

166
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,667
a worker uses an air gun    

167
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,205
to blow off tiny shards of metal
the cutting leaves behind.   

168
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,112
the arms go into a press    

169
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,181
that punches a hole for a hollow
steel cylinder called a boss. 

170
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,916
the boss is the housing for a pin           

171
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,852
that will connect one arm to the other,         

172
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:05,056
yet still allow them to pivot like a pair of scissors.    

173
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,992
workers now use a magnetic crane

174
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,395
to move the arm to the welding area.      

175
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,598
they insert the boss into the hole,         

176
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
then tack it in place.     

177
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:21,138
this piece will go on the end of each scissor arm,      

178
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,876
but first, they weld on another boss.        

179
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,650
now fully assembled, this piece
is called the male scissor end.

180
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,429
they tack it to one end of the scissor arm       

181
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:49,700
and tack a female scissor end to the arm's other end.    

182
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:54,705
robots now weld the two endpieces simultaneously,   

183
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,408
then the boss in the middle.  

184
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,180
now workers stack the scissor arms,       

185
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,249
putting a pin in each middle boss.      

186
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,517
they also install the hydraulic lift cylinder  

187
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,453
that will raise and lower the scissor stack.  

188
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,057
this manifold activates the lift cylinder       

189
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,394
by increasing and decreasing hydraulic pressure.      

190
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,405
workers fasten the connected scissor ends to each other   

191
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,141
by driving a pin through the boss.       

192
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,945
they secure it with a locking mechanism called a cotter pin. 

193
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,747
meanwhile, other workers assemble the base

194
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,216
of the scissor lift.      

195
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,685
at this stage, it's upside down.

196
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,823
at the rear, workers bolt in a hydraulic wheel motor.    

197
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,691
hydraulic pressure turns the motor,        

198
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,427
enabling the operator to move the scissor lift forward    

199
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,429
or backward.          

200
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,999
they slide a wheel onto the hub
and bolt it securely.     

201
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,043
this is the wheel hub onto which
the front wheel bolts.     

202
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,580
it attaches with a pin locked by a cotter pin. 

203
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,382
they install the hydraulic steering cylinder.       

204
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,785
this steel tie rod links the front wheels to each other 

205
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,588
so that they turn together.  

206
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,892
now workers hook up the hydraulic hoses.      

207
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,098
they pump a bit of grease in to lubricate the cylinder.   

208
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,272
next, they assemble and install the hydraulic tray.

209
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,873
it contains the electrical panel

210
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,809
that controls all machine functions,     

211
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,811
as well as the hydraulic tank and pump.           

212
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,747
the pump forces hydraulic fluid
to the wheel motor,      

213
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,283
steering cylinder, and lift cylinder.       

214
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:49,487
the hydraulic tray swings closed
under the base for protection. 

215
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,957
on the other side, they install the battery tray. 

216
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,626
it houses the four six-volt batteries       

217
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,828
that power the scissor lift, along with the battery charger.

218
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,230
the scissor stack, meanwhile, 

219
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,432
is in the paint booth getting a coat of primer,       

220
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,568
then a coat of urethane paint. 

221
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,170
this finish prevents the steel from rusting.         

222
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,239
after curing the paint in an oven,          

223
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,575
they install the scissor stack onto the base.         

224
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,110
now they connect the two hoses 

225
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,180
that run between the lift   
cylinder and the hydraulic pump.

226
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,448
through one hose,       

227
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,517
fluid goes to the cylinder to raise the scissor.     

228
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,322
through the other, fluid withdraws to lower the scissor.

229
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,924
they run cables from the electrical panel   

230
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,959
up through the scissor stack. 

231
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,462
after installing a platform made
of painted steel,       

232
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,663
they connect the cables    

233
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,132
to a control box on the platform rail.     

234
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,069
these controls enable a worker to operate the scissor lift  

235
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,771
from the platform.       

236
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,944
after a test drive, it's time to apply the decals, 

237
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,282
up to 75 of them depending on the model.         

238
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,818
some are decorative, but most specify safety information,  

239
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,122
such as the scissor lift's load capacity.         

240
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,766
narrator: for the nhl,     

241
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,970
a regulation skating rink is 200 feet long by 85 feet wide. 

242
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,708
the rink is basic construction,
but making the ice is an art. 

243
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,976
you have to get the thickness just right.          

244
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,310
if the ice is too thick,    

245
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,514
it will tax the refrigeration system and soften on top,   

246
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,049
but if the ice is too thin,  

247
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,552
skate blades will cut right through it.       

248
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,191
the rink floor is a concrete slab.        

249
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,463
covering it with ice begins in the arena's refrigeration room.

250
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,467
there, a powerful compressor pumps refrigeration fluid,   

251
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,669
usually methanol or saline,  

252
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,405
through pipes running underneath
the rink's floor.       

253
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,739
the concrete chills      

254
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,076
to between minus-15.8 and 18 degrees fahrenheit,   

255
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,881
the temperature range required 
for water to freeze on concrete.

256
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,023
this company made its own ice-making machine   

257
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,025
by retrofitting an ice resurfacer.       

258
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,762
its onboard water tank feeds 20 sprayers          

259
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,830
that mist a 13-foot span.   

260
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,770
the water freezes within seconds.        

261
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,571
to make a quality ice surface, 

262
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,107
you have to build up the ice in layers,           

263
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,576
each about .07 inch thick.   

264
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,780
driving in the standard outside-inside oval pattern,  

265
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,482
each layer takes just eight minutes.         

266
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,522
with two layers down, they paint the ice white.   

267
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,923
you'd think it would be simpler

268
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,925
to just paint directly on the concrete,        

269
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,326
but the paint would chip off  

270
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,795
when they remove the ice at the end of the season.   

271
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,931
they would have to scrape and clean the slab       

272
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,468
before repainting it -- a messy, expensive job.    

273
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,341
so, instead, the ice maker mixes
water and powdered paint    

274
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,412
in the onboard tank and sprays three layers onto the ice.   

275
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,014
this paint doesn't dry.    

276
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,683
just like the water the machine sprayed before,  

277
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,418
it freezes into white ice.   

278
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,563
this metal dioxide-based paint 

279
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,500
is specially formulated for skating rinks,       

280
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,968
designed to cling to a base coat
of ice.            

281
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,240
and unlike concrete paint,   
it's nontoxic and biodegradable,

282
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,975
so that at the end of the season,         

283
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,643
the arena can melt the ice   

284
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,047
and let the water drain without
contaminating the environment. 

285
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:46,857
now a crew comes in to paint the hockey markings. 

286
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,860
workers lay down string to mark
the borders of the red line,  

287
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,330
the blue lines, and the goal lines.      

288
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:04,008
they elevate intersecting lines 
so that the paintbrush can pass.

289
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,211
to paint the face-off circles, workers use an anchor,     

290
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,614
cable, and what's called a paint stick.         

291
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,683
it takes just 20 minutes or so to paint them.         

292
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,353
the paint is in a portable tank.

293
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,488
it flows down the paint-stick tube      

294
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,092
to a rectangular pad on the end.

295
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,645
now the goal crease at each net.

296
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,781
first, they trace a template, 

297
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,785
then fill in with a shade of blue you see in swimming pools.

298
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,187
they use the same technique  

299
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,724
to paint the eight red face-off spots.        

300
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,193
back to the blue line.     

301
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,198
first, they spray water to freeze the strings in place.

302
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,936
then, using a brush on the same type of paint stick

303
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,470
they use for the circles,   

304
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,474
they fill in the foot-wide space
between the strings.      

305
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:14,211
now for the home team's logo at center ice.         

306
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,348
after dabbing a mop in blue chalk, they run it over

307
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,685
a computer-generated paper stencil of the logo.   

308
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:24,989
this transfers the design outline to the ice.      

309
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,895
they spray water on the chalk lines to freeze them in place, 

310
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,464
then paint the logo.      

311
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,442
finally, with a garden hose,  

312
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,578
they spray water over all the markings to seal the paint.

313
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,314
then they slowly flood the ice with the larger hose      

314
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,049
for about a day and a half.  

315
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,319
this adds the final 1.1 inches of ice.            

316
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:59,123
the now-skateable ice surface is
about 1.6 inches thick,    

317
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,059
containing over 13,000 gallons of water,           

318
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,895
about 300 bathtubs full.    

319
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,470
if you have any comments about the show,        

320
