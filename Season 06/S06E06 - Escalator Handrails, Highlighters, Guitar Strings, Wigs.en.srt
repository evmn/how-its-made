1
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,291
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,260
     escalator handrails...     

3
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,066
     ...highlighter pens...     

4
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,571
      ...guitar strings...      

5
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,044
          ...and wigs.          

6
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,721
   the escalator was invented   
       over 100 years ago       

7
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,322
   as an amusement park ride.   

8
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,258
  the moving staircase was soon 
 equipped with a moving handrail

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,794
       for safety reasons,      

10
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,730
    but those early handrails   
   were driven by oily chains,  

11
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,065
       leaving passengers       
       with greasy hands.       

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,468
     we get a cleaner ride      
     on today's escalators,     

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,404
    and if we want thrills,     
    we try a roller coaster.    

14
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,542
     an escalator's handrail    

15
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,878
     moves at the same speed    
         as the stairs.         

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,480
  this makes the trip up safer  

17
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,482
   because you have something   
  to hold on to the entire way. 

18
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,418
 to make an escalator handrail, 

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,753
  a machine called an extruder  

20
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,421
     pulls synthetic rubber     
           up into it.          

21
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,024
         a turning screw        
       inside the extruder      

22
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,492
 forces the rubber through a die

23
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:37,429
      the way a pasta maker     
     squeezes out spaghetti.    

24
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,697
 4- to 6-inch-wide rubber strips

25
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,366
            roll out            
  into a tank of water to cool  

26
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,968
        because the heat        
        from the extruder       

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,704
           could alter          
   their molecular structure.   

28
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,442
      now the rubber strips     
        move over rollers       

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,579
  that are part of a mechanical 
        measuring system.       

30
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,914
   there's a little indicator   
          on the roller         

31
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,982
      that gauges the width     
   and thickness of the rubber  

32
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,052
       as it moves across.      

33
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,522
  over at the splitter machine, 

34
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:06,391
       small round knives       
     slice rubberized cotton    

35
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,460
         the same width         
      as the rubber strips.     

36
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,232
    then a mechanical puller    
        unrolls material        

37
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,666
   from four different spools.  

38
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,002
      there are two streams     
     of rubberized fabric --    

39
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,737
           one stream           
     of the synthetic rubber    

40
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,139
         which came out         
     of the extruder earlier    

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,809
      and one of rubberized     
          cable wiring.         

42
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,750
  they merge and stick together 

43
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,085
       as they travel over      
       a big steel roller.      

44
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,621
     an unwinder peels away     
         a plastic liner        

45
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,123
 from the now four-plied strip. 

46
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,497
      next, a worker places     
  a piece of rubberized fabric  

47
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,098
   and one of synthetic rubber  

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,834
         on either side         
    of the four-plied strip.    

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,638
      he presses everything     
   except the strip of rubber   

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,107
        around a u-shaped       
        aluminum former.        

51
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,842
     with a piece of steel,     

52
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:01,646
   he bears down on the shape   
  so the layers stick together. 

53
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,982
   then he brushes tack cement  
         on the outside         

54
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,718
     and pulls that piece of    
 synthetic rubber at the bottom 

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,253
          up around it.         

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,324
     he folds the rim down,     

57
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,595
    and, using a hand roller,   
       he seals its edges.      

58
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,339
        now the handrail        
        has taken shape,        

59
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,207
   but it's not strong enough,  

60
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,144
      so a worker places it     
       in a molding press.      

61
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,082
    he positions a steel form   
       inside the handrail      

62
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,685
   so that it holds its shape.  

63
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,821
the top part of the mold lowers,

64
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,958
     and the handrail bakes     
       under high pressure      

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,293
   at 350 degrees fahrenheit.   

66
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,430
     10 to 15 minutes later,    
         the mold lifts,        

67
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,500
 and a chemical reaction called 
   vulcanization has occurred.  

68
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,102
 the layers have been laminated,

69
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,438
        and the handrail        
      is now strong enough.     

70
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,715
  the last step is to trim away 
  the flash or excess material. 

71
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,919
      here's the latest way     
 to make an escalator handrail. 

72
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,322
  a puller unwinds brass-coated 
    steel wires from spools,    

73
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,657
          drawing them,         

74
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,793
    along with thermoplastic    
 urethane and polyester fabric, 

75
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,295
through the dies of an extruder.

76
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,865
    what comes out is a strip   

77
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:31,069
    of plastic-encased wires    
          and sliders.          

78
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,939
       the handrail shape       
passes through measuring devices

79
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,607
   that check its dimensions.   

80
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,347
   now they splice the ends of  
 two plastic handrails together 

81
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,415
    to form an endless loop.    

82
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,718
using a roller, a worker presses

83
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,622
 the wires and plastic sliders  
 of the inner carcass together. 

84
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,160
 as he rolls, he blasts hot air 
into the splice with a heat gun.

85
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,630
    this softens the plastic    
   so that it melds together.   

86
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,636
    he covers it with a piece   
    of thermoplastic urethane   

87
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,639
   and, again, uses a heat gun  
       to join the pieces.      

88
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,044
 he wipes it clean with alcohol.

89
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,515
  then he heats it up in a mold 
      for a minute or two.      

90
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,518
       the spliced section      
         melts together,        

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,854
 and then cool water hardens it.

92
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,529
   there's no seam line where   
   the handrail could break.    

93
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,665
            it's just           
   one long, continuous piece.  

94
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,870
  and that's the inside story   
  on the escalator handrail --  

95
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,840
    something to think about    
   when you're on your way up.  

96
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,493
  narrator: the highlighter pen 
    was invented in the 1960s   

97
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,827
  simply to get your attention. 

98
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,098
       when text is shaded      
  with transparent, vivid inks  

99
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,965
  in hot pinks or warm yellows, 

100
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,967
  our eye goes directly to it.  

101
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,104
   marketers have always known  
     that color has impact,     

102
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,508
and it's a principle highlighted
         by these pens.         

103
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:25,983
  highlighters come in lots of  
 shades and colors -- even neon.

104
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,521
  this is how a highlighter pen 
         gets its start.        

105
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:33,458
a vacuum siphons plastic pellets
      into this container.      

106
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,393
          the red ones          
     will tint the whole mix    

107
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,462
           as it melts          
     inside a heating tube.     

108
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,130
    a mechanized steel screw    

109
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,134
    pushes the melted plastic   
         into pen molds.        

110
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:46,805
   the force applied is equal   
 to the weight of 350 elephants.

111
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,607
        cooled by water,        

112
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,343
  the newly-molded pen barrels  
  spill into a container below. 

113
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,879
     now some clear-colored     
           pen barrels          

114
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,282
   drop onto a conveyor track,  

115
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,883
       and ink reservoirs       

116
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,953
 that look like pieces of chalk 
    but are made of polyester   

117
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,288
       drop down a shaft,       

118
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,324
 and a robotic arm thrusts them 
    into the plastic barrels.   

119
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,830
        the back-end plug       
      goes in the same way.     

120
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,433
the plugs fall to a robotic arm,

121
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:18,637
       and it pushes them       
    into the back of the pen.   

122
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,972
          now a chemist         
   drops a concentrate of dye   

123
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,841
     into a beaker of water.    

124
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,443
    just over 1/3 of an ounce   
           or 10 drops          

125
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,113
      is enough to turn it      
        fire-engine red.        

126
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,914
          a humectant,          
      already in the water,     

127
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,051
  will keep the ink from drying 
    out when it's in the pen.   

128
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,789
        next he measures        
      the ink's thickness.      

129
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,326
he lowers a steel probe into it,
      and the probe turns.      

130
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,995
   a gauge measures the speed.  

131
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,198
  if the probe turns too fast,  
  it means the ink is too thin. 

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,802
   if it revolves too slowly,   
   then the mix is too thick.   

133
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,603
 at four revolutions per minute,

134
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,006
         the ink is just        
     the right consistency.     

135
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,479
  a vacuum pump sucks the ink   
  into six-inch steel needles,  

136
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,149
       and a robotic arm        
       pushes the needles       

137
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,019
 into the polyester reservoirs, 
    injecting them with ink.    

138
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,289
          now we arrive         
  at the next part of assembly. 

139
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,493
   a combination of mechanical  
  vibrations and compressed air 

140
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,495
     drive a conveyor belt      
     carrying the pen nibs.     

141
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,565
  the nibs fall into the clutch 
      of a mechanical claw      

142
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,368
        which drops them        
      to a circular pusher.     

143
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,838
     it shoves the nibs onto    
  the pens, and they interlock. 

144
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,808
 the impact floods the reservoir
    inside the pen with ink.    

145
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,045
now it's time to top it all off.

146
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,914
   a conveyor transports caps   
    to a mechanical gripper.    

147
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,651
     the gripper slides them    
         over the nibs.         

148
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,122
 over on another assembly line, 

149
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,857
         they're making         
     a three-in-one marker.     

150
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,328
 a conveyor bowl funnels smaller
  ink reservoirs into a shaft,  

151
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,064
 and they drop to a robotic arm.

152
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,468
  the arm stuffs the reservoirs 
     into the small barrels,    

153
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,070
        and then a needle       
     injects them with ink,     

154
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,574
     quickly saturating the     
 reservoirs with vibrant color. 

155
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,147
   the next robotic arm shoves  
  a receptacle onto the barrel, 

156
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,417
     and then another robot     
presses a polyester nib onto it.

157
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,157
        a robot now slips       
  a hood-like cap over the nib. 

158
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,359
     another mechanical arm     

159
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,894
 suctions up the fuchsia-colored
          mini markers          

160
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,798
       and transfers them       
      to a triangular case.     

161
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,170
         down the line,         
     another suctioning arm     

162
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:36,241
   picks up a red mini marker   
and deposits it in the triangle.

163
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,310
  a steel probe presses it in.  

164
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,314
finally, a yellow-colored marker
     completes the triangle.    

165
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,784
           now a robot          
    uses an electrical charge   

166
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,252
  to pick up metallic confetti. 

167
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,920
 when the charge is turned off, 

168
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,391
   the confetti drops into the  
 triangle, adding some glitter. 

169
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,860
     next a suctioning robot    

170
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,864
    drops the top part of the   
  triangle onto the lower case, 

171
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,934
      and a metal cylinder      
        presses it shut.        

172
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,337
 another suctioning arm carries 
     the three-in-one marker    

173
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,975
       to a conveyor belt       
  which unloads it into a box.  

174
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,879
  this three-in-one highlighter 

175
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,148
         makes it easier        
      to color-code text --     

176
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,250
        a different color       
         for each theme.        

177
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,156
   now an electrical conveyor   
     moves the highlighters     

178
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,824
      to a mechanical arm.      

179
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,893
    the arm flips it around,    

180
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,762
         positioning it         
       for the next step.       

181
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,498
     a squeegee silk-screens    
         a logo onto it.        

182
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,235
    i wonder how they came up   
         with that one.         

183
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,237
   now the highlighters enter   
  an ultraviolet-light chamber. 

184
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,974
     the light bonds the ink    
          to the case.          

185
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,576
          and finally,          
      the ultimate test --      

186
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,113
 plastic grippers guide markers 
      as they make circles.     

187
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,585
   700 to 1,000 circles means   
 this particular production line

188
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,887
   will definitely stand out.   

189
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,198
  narrator: playing the guitar  
    is all about vibrations.    

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,534
           the guitar           
     uses vibrating strings     

191
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,870
      to generate the tones     
    that the audience hears.    

192
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,540
strings under tension vibrate at
 a specific frequency or pitch, 

193
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,410
       so if the song that      
   you're hearing is in tune,   

194
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:21,613
    it's because those guitar   
strings are vibrating correctly.

195
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,151
        [ guitar plays ]        

196
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,028
      a good set of strings     
 is behind many a soulful tune. 

197
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,597
    they're an important part   
      of a guitar's sound.      

198
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,303
  to make a guitar string, they 
  start with a steel core wire  

199
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,374
        that they examine       
 under a zoom stereomicroscope. 

200
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,709
   they magnify it 100 times,   

201
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,979
        looking for flaws       
     in the hexagonal wire.     

202
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,515
       next, they measure       
    the core wire's diameter    

203
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,184
   with a digital micrometer.   

204
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,253
          it has to be          
      just the right size.      

205
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,590
now they coil the wrap wire made
     of nickel-plated steel     

206
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,325
          around posts          
 on the instron testing machine.

207
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,263
 this machine stretches the wire
        until it breaks.        

208
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,733
   it's a test of its ability   
   to perform under tension.    

209
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,735
a computer measures the distance

210
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,271
     and the amount of load     
       the wire was under       

211
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,739
         before it broke        

212
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,476
  to determine how much tension 
      this string can take.     

213
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:28,413
        now the core wire       
     undergoes a twist test.    

214
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,681
 they loop the wire onto a hook 

215
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,550
          in a machine          
    called a torsion tester.    

216
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,688
   it spins rapidly, twisting   
 the core wire until it breaks. 

217
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,626
  this is a test of the wire's  
    strength and elasticity.    

218
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,829
     these plastic hoppers      
     are full of ball ends.     

219
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,432
     this machine is called     
       a ball-end sorter.       

220
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,567
hollow pistons move up and down,

221
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,102
     selecting one ball end     
           at a time.           

222
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,905
  this ensures that only those  
       of the proper size       

223
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,908
        will get through.       

224
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,780
          the ball ends         
    shoot out of the pistons    

225
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,215
    into a bucket underneath.   

226
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,687
      from here they'll go      
   to the core-string machine.  

227
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,129
           a mechanism          
  places the ball ends on a pin 

228
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,331
   as they drop from a hopper.  

229
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,538
   rollers feed the core wire   
      into a clamping guide     

230
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,374
         which aligns it        
       with the ball end.       

231
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,812
       then the pin spins,      

232
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,816
     twisting the wire into     
a neat loop around the ball end.

233
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,187
   this is the twisting action  
         in slow motion.        

234
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,697
        the core strings        
 with the ball ends now attached

235
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,699
     drop into a repository.    

236
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,437
 then a worker hooks a ball end 
       with its core wire       

237
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,238
     onto the string winder,    

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,643
  and he loops bronze wrap wire 
      around the core wire.     

239
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,446
    a string-winding carriage   
     guides the bronze wire     

240
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,851
down the length of the core wire
       as it wraps around.      

241
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,120
 the electrically powered winder
      spins the core wire,      

242
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,656
      and it's that action      
    that grabs the wrap wire    

243
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,759
     as the carriage ensures    
  that it gets wrapped neatly.  

244
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,531
  computerized sensors monitor  

245
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,332
            the speed           
  that the string is wound at,  

246
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,235
     as well as the tension.    

247
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,274
       the winder applies       
  a critical amount of tension  

248
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,143
  as it wraps the bronze wiring 
        around the core.        

249
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,890
 they're bundled up like straw, 
     144 wires to the bunch.    

250
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,562
         guitar strings         
    are also made from nylon.   

251
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,632
       they hook the nylon      
  core material onto a winder,  

252
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,801
         pulling it down        
        from a big spool.       

253
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:10,241
  next, they loop silver-plated 
copper wrap wire onto the nylon.

254
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,513
         the hook spins,        
  and this coils the wrap wire  

255
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,716
     around the nylon string    
           binding it.          

256
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,786
    again, a carriage system,   
    run by an electric motor,   

257
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,089
     ensures that everything    
        falls into place.       

258
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,260
  a worker removes the strings  
    and hangs them on a rack.   

259
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,463
   gravity causes the strings   
     to slide into a station    

260
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:37,334
where workers coil them and then
 place them on a conveyor belt. 

261
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,672
 further down the line, another 
    worker puts them in a bag   

262
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,008
   that has a gas-neutralizing  
 barrier built into the plastic 

263
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,110
      to prevent corrosion.     

264
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,282
      and now these strings     
   are ready for some playing.  

265
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,703
  narrator: throughout history, 
   wigs were status symbols --  

266
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,772
    hence the term "bigwig."    

267
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,774
 one early wig-making technique 

268
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,310
       was to use goatskin      
       to simulate a scalp      

269
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,714
   and then hook hair into it   
   with an embroidery needle.   

270
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,850
       today, animal skin       
       is no longer used.       

271
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,860
           these days,          
      wigs can look so real     

272
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,329
    that no one would notice.   

273
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,531
      to make a custom wig,     

274
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,668
    a wig master measures the   
 client's head from all angles, 

275
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,437
          because heads         
 come in many shapes and sizes. 

276
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,408
        he wraps her head       
         in cellophane,         

277
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,277
     twisting it just under     
          the earlobes.         

278
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,281
  next, he sticks filament tape 
  all over the cellophane wrap. 

279
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,451
     he layers it four times    
         to make a cast.        

280
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,290
      he lifts the tape and     
  cellophane cast from her head 

281
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,159
          and places it         
         on a wig block,        

282
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,163
          a head shape          
     made of canvas or wood.    

283
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,966
     using a grease pencil,     
   he traces around the cast,   

284
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,103
making a pattern of the client's
   hairline on the wig block.   

285
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,510
 the wig master then cuts pieces
      of plain blue paper.      

286
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,447
   he pins it on the wig block  
    within the pattern lines.   

287
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,048
  the paper will prevent light  

288
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,418
  from reflecting into his eyes 
          as he works.          

289
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,456
   now he places a large-sized  
    polyester-and-cotton lace   

290
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,657
          on the block          

291
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,859
           and cuts it          
      to pencilled outline.     

292
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,529
      he pins a finer lace      
      from front to back,       

293
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,531
  pleating the edges with pins. 

294
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:52,269
     he pulls open a drawer     
   full of real and fake hair,  

295
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,738
      and it's hard to tell     
  the difference between them.  

296
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,609
 he chooses a tail of synthetic 
 hair labelled "venetian blond."

297
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,347
    pieces of pink and orange   
         synthetic hair         

298
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,950
      will be blended into      
   the venetian blond tresses   

299
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,852
 to create dramatic highlights. 

300
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,889
  this is the tool for the job. 

301
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,758
        it's a giant comb       
 with rows of sharp steel teeth.

302
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,161
      it's called a hackle.     

303
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,434
    the wig master places the   
  venetian blond synthetic hair 

304
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,102
 between the teeth of the hackle

305
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,272
    and sets the bright pink    
    and orange locks on top.    

306
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,581
now he repeatedly drags the hair
       through the hackle.      

307
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,117
      he loses some strands     
          in the comb,          

308
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,920
      but those are usually     
        the weaker ones.        

309
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,989
    this is called hackling,    

310
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,059
       and the action gets      
  progressively more vigorous.  

311
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:52,063
he twists and twirls the tail as
he pulls it through the hackle. 

312
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,065
this is actually dangerous work.

313
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,466
         one wrong move         

314
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,069
  and he could pierce his hand  
       on the barbed comb.      

315
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,879
    once the hair is blended,   
       he cuts it in two.       

316
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,548
    then he presses the hair    
     into little metal pins     

317
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,550
   on a leather holding card.   

318
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,354
the pins on a top card interlock
      with the bottom one.      

319
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,964
he pulls hair out of the holding
 cards a few strands at a time. 

320
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,167
       with a small needle      
 that looks like a fishing hook,

321
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,169
      he knots the strands      
          into the lace         

322
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,904
     beginning at the nape.     

323
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,773
   this is called ventilating.  

324
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,775
        it's very similar       
         to rug hooking.        

325
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:42,380
 in fact, it may be why toupees 
 are often referred to as rugs. 

326
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,717
 ventilating is labor-intensive.

327
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,519
 he spends a minimum of 50 hours

328
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,521
     knotting the thousands     
           of strands           

329
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,456
  that it takes to make a wig.  

330
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,470
      partway into the job,     
    he combs out any tangles    

331
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,874
      and flounces the hair     
to make sure it moves naturally.

332
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,413
      wigs for film and tv      
    are usually made by hand    

333
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,747
       rather than machine      

334
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,217
       because the result       
   is more authentic-looking.   

335
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,952
  because the camera tells all, 

336
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,154
      the wigs need to look     
      as real as possible.      

337
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,564
 he weaves the front of the wig 
      one strand at a time,     

338
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,034
   because the front hairline   
 always gets the most scrutiny. 

339
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:47,978
  now it's time for the fitting 
     and the transformation.    

340
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,147
          the wig needs         
       a little styling...      

341
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,519
    ...and he trims the ends.   

342
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,789
  he cuts away the extra lace,  
           and voilà.           

343
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,192
           she's ready          
 to let her synthetic hair down 

344
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,126
   and get into her new role.
