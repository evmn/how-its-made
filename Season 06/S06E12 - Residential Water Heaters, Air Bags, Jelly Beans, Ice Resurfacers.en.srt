00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,757
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:28,594
  residential water heaters...  

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,832
         ...air bags...         

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,005
        ...jelly beans...       

5
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,244
     ...and ice resurfacers.    

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,121
  the residential water heater  
   was invented back in 1889,   

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,790
      and the basic concept     
      still applies today.      

8
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,392
         it heats water,        
    usually with natural gas,   

9
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,462
    propane, or electricity,    

10
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,663
 then keeps it continuously hot 

11
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,934
     so that you always have    
a supply ready for the bathroom,

12
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,670
            kitchen,            
  or anywhere else you need it. 

13
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,209
  water heaters may look plain, 

14
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,879
        but there's a lot       
        going on inside.        

15
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,351
 to make one, a hydraulic press 
 transforms a round, steel blank

16
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,953
       into a dome shape.       

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,756
  this dome will form the base  
      of a gas-heated tank,     

18
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,791
  and it will hold the burner.  

19
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,164
 next, rollers behind and above 

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,633
      curl a sheet of steel     
       around a cylinder.       

21
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,970
this forms the inner-tank shape.

22
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,305
      a seam-welder device      

23
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,107
    then pinches the two ends   
   of the tank shape together   

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,709
         and welds them.        

25
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,382
        in the next step,       

26
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:01,186
a worker positions the tank body
   under a projection-welder.   

27
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,188
 he selects a threaded fitting, 

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,923
     places it on the tank,     

29
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,159
     and lowers the welder.     

30
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,131
     this projection-welder     
uses 10,000 volts of electricity

31
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,532
        to fuse fittings        
        to the tank body.       

32
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,069
     it also welds fittings     
     to the top of the tank.    

33
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,403
     valves and other parts     

34
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,006
         will be screwed        
   into these fittings later.   

35
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:29,147
          next, a press         
  applies over 27 tons of force 

36
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,416
   to fit a top onto the tank.  

37
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,753
  then they spray liquid enamel 
  inside of the spinning tank.  

38
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,157
       it will be baked in      
       at 1,650 fahrenheit      

39
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:40,559
         for 45 minutes         
       to prevent rusting.      

40
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:44,163
   now it's back to the bottom  
          of the tank.          

41
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,232
  a worker inserts a flue tube  
    in a hole in the center,    

42
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,835
     and an automated welder    
   joins it to the tank base.   

43
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,805
    the flue will vent gases    
        from the burner.        

44
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,848
 after anti-rust enamel coating 
is baked onto the base and flue,

45
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,317
    they lower the tank body    
            onto it.            

46
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,922
   next, robotic welding arms   
   work both ends of the tank.  

47
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,591
    one welds the base to it,   

48
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,793
    the other bonds the flue    
           to the top.          

49
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,998
     now the pressure test.     

50
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,733
   they pump air into the tank  

51
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,801
       and then pour water      
        over the outside.       

52
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,403
  if water bubbles on the tank, 

53
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,205
    it means air is escaping    

54
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,209
       and there's a leak       
     that needs to be fixed.    

55
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,449
   here they install elements   
 in an electric water heater... 

56
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,922
...and they hook up a thermostat
  and the wires that run to it. 

57
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,765
now it's time to make the tank's
     outer shell, or jacket.    

58
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,034
       an operator slides       
      a painted-steel shape     

59
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:00,072
         onto a mandrel         
 so that it becomes cylindrical.

60
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,443
          a lockformer          
    then moves along a rail,    

61
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,045
      folding and pressing      
       the seam together.       

62
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,520
       next, a rollformer       
 crimps the top and bottom edges

63
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,357
          so that lids          
    can be easily installed.    

64
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,533
 here they drape a plastic apron
         over a tank...         

65
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,136
...and then slide on its jacket,
         or tank shell,         

66
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,507
     with just the electric     
       components exposed.      

67
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,444
    they screw a steel cover    
           over them.           

68
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,881
     here's a demonstration     
         of what's next.        

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,148
       a chemical reaction      

70
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:49,020
    causes polyurethane foam    
      to expand in seconds.     

71
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,756
 they inject this expanding foam
     into the plastic apron     

72
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,359
   that's now between the tank  
        and outer shell.        

73
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,862
the foam will insulate the tank.

74
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,632
         now they finish        
      installing the wiring     

75
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,267
   on this electric heater...   

76
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,771
  ...and then do an inspection. 

77
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,173
       it makes the grade.      

78
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,643
         on gas heaters,        

79
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,245
       they slide a burner      
    into the dome-shaped base   

80
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,849
   and then connect the burner  
     tubes to the gas valve.    

81
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,120
     they attach some wiring    

82
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,791
          that controls         
     the burner ignition...     

83
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,727
       and then hook it up      
 to the gas line for a test run.

84
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,930
         that inner glow        
     is the burner at work.     

85
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,000
 they light a torch on the flame
   and pass it over the valve   

86
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,068
 to check for little gas leaks. 

87
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,939
        it didn't ignite,       
      so there aren't any.      

88
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,408
  it gets the seal of approval, 

89
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,210
 and now it's up to the consumer

90
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,313
        to test the water       
      when it's installed.      

91
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,193
      narrator: the air bag     
   was invented in the 1960s,   

92
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,295
 but it actually didn't catch on
   until several years later.   

93
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,696
          by the 1980s,         

94
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,633
 automakers were installing them
        in most vehicles.       

95
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,970
  air bags deploy when sensors  
  detect a sudden deceleration  

96
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,171
        and inflate them,       

97
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,641
    giving vehicle occupants    
    the protection they need.   

98
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,849
    this side-curtain air bag   

99
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,784
   inflates in less than .020   
          of a second.          

100
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,887
   blink, and you'll miss it.   

101
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,657
  air bags don't have any seams 

102
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,660
      because they're woven     
          in one piece.         

103
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,730
     big, computerized looms    
  weave at a blurring speed --  

104
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,866
   600 revolutions per minute.  

105
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,669
         they're called         
    air-jet lacquered looms.    

106
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,272
       they lift and lower      
         each nylon yarn        

107
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,941
      to make an intricate      
        one-piece fabric.       

108
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,011
       up to 10,700 yarns       

109
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,881
          could be used         
      to make the material.     

110
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,483
  if even one of the thousands  
         of yarns break,        

111
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,351
      an electrical sensor      
         will detect it         

112
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,887
     and shut the loom down.    

113
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,690
           it's a step          
   to ensure quality control.   

114
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,625
       despite this rapid       
         weaving action,        

115
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,162
   the loom produces just over  
   26 feet of fabric an hour.   

116
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,432
         that's because         
     it's very dense fabric.    

117
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,300
          that density          
     will allow the air bag     

118
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,104
    to stand up to the force    
         of deployment.         

119
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,979
    now the woven fabric goes   
 through an inspection station. 

120
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:33,051
as automated rollers wind it up,
      a worker examines it.     

121
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,154
       if it's acceptable,      
        he signs it off.        

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,935
           next, it's           
   on to the scouring station.  

123
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,271
         here a machine         
   unwinds the air-bag fabric   

124
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,408
   as rollers guide it towards  
      a wash-and-dry system     

125
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,877
      that's 118 feet long.     

126
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,814
        the rollers draw        
      the air-bag material      

127
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,550
        through a number        
        of big wash tanks       

128
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,886
 to ensure a thorough cleaning. 

129
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,494
  then a series of hot rollers  
    dry and press the fabric.   

130
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,842
      the freshly laundered     
        air-bag material        

131
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,111
          moves through         
      the coating machine.      

132
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,581
  a hose pumps liquid silicone  
        onto the fabric,        

133
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,450
     and a scraper overhead     
         distributes it.        

134
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,052
   as a worker scoops some up,  

135
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,556
 you can see that it's as thick 
          as molasses.          

136
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,795
       the silicone seals       
       the air-bag fabric.      

137
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,198
     but it's wet and sticky    
        and needs to dry,       

138
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,534
      so it passes through      
        a series of ovens       

139
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,472
         heated to about        
     370 degrees fahrenheit.    

140
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,476
 as it dries, the silicone cures
         to the fabric.         

141
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,416
   now a computer-guided laser  
        cuts the material       

142
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,817
  with the precision and speed  

143
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,720
          that no human         
      could ever replicate.     

144
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,093
        black lines woven       
into the fabric assist the laser

145
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,629
 as it cuts the air-bag design. 

146
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,897
      at any point in time,     

147
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,301
 it's cutting multiple air bags 
       out of the fabric.       

148
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,909
      when the job is done,     

149
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,346
        the conveyor belt       
   moves the air bags forward.  

150
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,692
   and now they're scrutinized  
           by humans.           

151
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,195
  a worker pulls the one-piece  
    air bag across a template   

152
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:02,333
  and examines it to make sure  
      the dimensions match.     

153
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:05,737
       then it's sent over      
     to the sewing station.     

154
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,673
      although the air bags     
   have been seamlessly woven,  

155
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:13,011
  attachment and reinforcements 
     still need to sewn on.     

156
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,880
          the stitching         
     is computer-controlled.    

157
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,550
    a worker feeds the fabric   
      to the sewing machine     

158
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,953
         and then simply        
        presses a button.       

159
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,022
           the machine          
   stitches together the tabs   

160
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,490
  that will connect the air bag 

161
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,292
          to the inside         
      of the vehicle frame      

162
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,894
   just above the side window.  

163
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,699
      here it sews a tether     
          onto the bag.         

164
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,835
      this strip of fabric      
        will also be used       

165
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,304
  to hold the air bag in place. 

166
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,176
          now it's time         
    to test a sample air bag    

167
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,278
    from the production run.    

168
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,584
  and, yes, it works perfectly. 

169
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,797
    narrator: the jelly bean    
      is a colorful treat.      

170
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,331
       but, unfortunately,      

171
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,402
 no one is sure exactly when the
 jelly bean was invented or how.

172
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,137
          it's believed         
      that the jelly center     

173
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,074
 dates back to biblical times as
 a candy called turkish delight.

174
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,310
      many centuries later,     
   the outer shell was added,   

175
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,847
   thus making the jelly bean   
         we know today.         

176
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,086
 the jelly bean is very popular.

177
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,956
        billions are sold       
        at easter alone.        

178
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,291
      to make jelly beans,      

179
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,093
     they heat liquid sugar     
         in a big kettle        

180
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,363
   to 347 degrees fahrenheit.   

181
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,597
        they add glucose,       

182
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,432
            which is            
   a more concentrated sugar,   

183
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,368
        and then starch.        

184
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,573
       an agitating device      
    mixes it all together...    

185
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,241
 while elsewhere in the factory,

186
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,578
   starch spills out of a drum  
         onto big trays.        

187
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,383
 a leveler moves back and forth 

188
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,520
     to even out the starch     
          on the trays.         

189
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,189
  the trays then move forward,  

190
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,791
     and a brush knocks off     
       the excess starch.       

191
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,928
      it will be recycled.      

192
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,136
a molding board now presses down
        into the starch.        

193
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,940
          it makes 756          
     jelly-bean impressions     

194
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,542
   in the starch in each tray.  

195
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,011
  the impressions in the starch 
       will serve as molds      

196
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,280
   for the jelly-bean centers.  

197
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,290
         nozzles inject         
    the sugar-and-starch mix    

198
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,026
      cooked in the kettle      
     into the starch molds.     

199
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,896
   this system can make almost  
  a million jelly-bean centers  

200
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:49,100
            an hour.            

201
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,702
     next, the conveyor belt    

202
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,104
  takes the jelly-bean centers  
       to the drying room,      

203
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,640
  where they stay for 24 hours. 

204
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,110
      this solidifies them.     
      they become chewier.      

205
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,655
       arms flip the trays      
of dried candy centers in starch

206
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,992
  and dump them into a big drum 
    that will separate them.    

207
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,660
    when the trays flip back,   

208
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,395
  they're refilled with starch, 

209
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,098
     and the molding process    
          begins again.         

210
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,374
           meanwhile,           
  the dried jelly-bean centers, 

211
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,876
 now separated from the starch, 

212
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:36,014
   tumble out of the drum onto  
  a wire-mesh conveyor system.  

213
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,421
       it transports them       
        to a steam belt,        

214
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,023
       which dampens them.      

215
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,891
        this readies them       
      for the next step --      

216
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,560
          sugarcoating.         

217
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,829
     the jelly-bean centers     
      go into a sander drum     

218
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,097
     that tosses them around    

219
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,401
    while nozzles spray them    
           with sugar.          

220
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,041
 in another part of the factory,

221
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,378
     liquid sugar flows out     
     of a kettle into a tub.    

222
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,517
a worker adds blue food coloring
          to the syrup,         

223
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,720
    and then he blends it in.   

224
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,989
       this mix is called       
        engrossing syrup.       

225
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,726
  he adds the engrossing syrup, 
   along with some flavoring,   

226
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,061
    to the jelly-bean centers   

227
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,397
      as they tumble around     
   in a tilted, spinning pan.   

228
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,801
         after they turn        
       a very sticky blue,      

229
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,536
   the worker dumps some sugar  
          into the pan.         

230
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,873
          this process          
     is repeated four times     

231
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,209
 in order to build up a coating 
    around the gummy center.    

232
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,013
          the next day,         
  when the beans have hardened, 

233
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:46,017
  they add hot syrup to the mix 
and toss the beans around again.

234
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,020
 this polishes the jelly beans. 

235
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,222
          there's a lot         
     of sweet stuff here --     

236
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:55,093
124,000 jelly beans in each pan.

237
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,698
    now he adds a little wax.   

238
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,433
      and as the pan spins,     

239
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,770
   the beans rub against each   
  other, distributing the wax.  

240
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,706
 this adds gloss to the polish. 

241
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,648
  then the pan stops spinning,  

242
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,584
   and the jelly beans air dry  
          for 24 hours          

243
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,720
   to allow the glaze to set.   

244
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,189
    it's the finishing touch.   

245
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,259
        after 3 1/2 days,       

246
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,629
         this big batch         
    of jelly beans is ready.    

247
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,334
            they move           
     in a multi-colored mass    

248
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,938
  along a series of conveyors.  

249
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,744
  they fall into a scale system 

250
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,348
     that portions them out     
     for specific bag sizes.    

251
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,816
     then a trap door opens,    

252
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,553
   and they drop down a chute   
  to the packaging department.  

253
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,022
    once they're in the bag,    

254
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,892
    the jelly beans are ready   
      to sweeten your day.      

255
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,368
   narrator: in just minutes,   

256
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,437
  an ice resurfacer can smooth  
           the surface          

257
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,372
        of an ice-skating       
         or hockey rink.        

258
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,308
 before it was invented in 1949,

259
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,578
  it took several workers over  
  an hour to resurface the ice  

260
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,913
   using scrapers, squeegees,   
           and hoses.           

261
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,784
      today, these machines     
 provide quick, uniform results.

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,061
    if you ice-skate, you're    
   thankful for this machine.   

263
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,465
   it smooths the ice in just   
  a few turns around the rink.  

264
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,734
   to make an ice resurfacer,   

265
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,937
 they weld together steel pieces
     to build the mainframe.    

266
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,740
 the frame has to be very strong

267
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,208
     because it will support    
   everything from the engine   

268
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,744
       to the water tank.       

269
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,480
  it's a load of almost 3 tons. 

270
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,420
 sparks fly as they grind smooth
            the areas           

271
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,155
  where parts will be mounted.  

272
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:08,259
  the sparks are actually steel 
   fragments being sanded off.  

273
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,097
 next, they weld support braces 
       with holes in them       

274
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,965
to the center of the water tank.

275
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,366
    these are called baffles,   

276
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,236
    and the holes will allow    
            the water           

277
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,338
     to flow into both ends     
          of the tank.          

278
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,442
     now they slide a piece     
       of spiraling steel,      

279
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,413
    which is auger flighting,   
      on one end of a pipe.     

280
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,183
   and they slip a piece that   
twists in the opposite direction

281
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,219
     on the other end of it.    

282
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,662
   they weld a u-shaped paddle  
           to the pipe          

283
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,698
 between the two steel spirals, 
         or flightings.         

284
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,934
 the paddle is a critical part. 

285
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,536
    the flightings will feed    
       ice shavings to it,      

286
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,072
       and the paddle will      
     then toss them to a bin    

287
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,009
   mounted above a water tank   
    to be disposed of later.    

288
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,484
     next, the worker clamps    
          the flighting         

289
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,685
    to a hydraulic cylinder.    

290
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,822
 he turns a lever, and hydraulic
     energy pulls the clamp,    

291
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,192
   drawing the auger flighting  
       snugly to the pipe.      

292
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,300
       as the clamp holds       
   the flighting in position,   

293
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,203
    he welds it to the pipe.    

294
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,010
   now they're solidly sealed   
            together.           

295
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,648
      next, another worker      
    places a long steel blade   

296
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,116
      on a magnetic table.      

297
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,651
    the magnets hold it down    

298
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,454
 while a grinding machine moves 
  over it, sharpening the edge. 

299
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,191
      because the grinding      
         generates heat,        

300
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,194
     the machine also floods    
      the blade with water.     

301
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,231
       this cools it down       
    so the steel stays hard.    

302
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:59,003
 now, using a crane, they lower 
    an engine onto the frame    

303
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,172
   that we saw welded together  
            earlier.            

304
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,480
         then they slide        
 the rear drive shaft into place

305
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,050
        and bolt it down        
    using a pneumatic wrench.   

306
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:20,091
 the tires for an ice resurfacer
will need some serious traction.

307
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,628
        each tire gets 92       
      of these metal studs.     

308
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,332
       they drop the studs      
    into a revolving feeder.    

309
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,036
  the studs funnel down a tube  
        to the stud gun,        

310
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,705
 ensuring that it never runs out
         of ammunition.         

311
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:46,050
the road these tires travel will
 be nothing but a sheet of ice, 

312
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,353
  and these studs should allow  
    them to stay the course.    

313
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,325
      next, using a crane,      

314
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,628
  they transfer the water tank  
   to the center of the frame.  

315
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,602
  the snow bin, which will hold 
    the scraped ice, is next.   

316
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,672
  they place it on pivot points 
          at the front.         

317
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:14,211
  then workers slide the blade  
           into place.          

318
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,782
      the bolt it tightly,      
working from the center outward.

319
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,819
    the workers are shielded    
    from the very sharp blade   

320
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,789
       by a plastic sleeve      
     that sheathes the edge.    

321
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,126
    when the blade is secure,   
    they remove the plastic.    

322
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,165
      now it's time to give     
 the ice resurfacer a test run. 

323
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,169
      the steel flightings      
    twist towards the paddle    

324
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,237
 at the center, as they should. 

325
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,574
        here's a close-up       
    of that razor-sharp blade   

326
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,843
    that will shave the ice.    

327
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:49,847
  a rectangular scraper slides  
      over the flightings,      

328
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,684
preventing snow from building up
    and clogging the system.    

329
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,056
this ice resurfacer is now ready
          for the rink,         

330
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,793
 and it's sure to smooth the ice
       for years to come.
