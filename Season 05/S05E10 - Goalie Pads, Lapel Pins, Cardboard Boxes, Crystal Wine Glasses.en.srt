00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,225
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,527
         goalie pads...         

3
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,999
        ...lapel pins...        

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,072
      ...cardboard boxes...     

5
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,943
   ...and crystal wineglasses.  

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,586
            in 1896,            

7
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:58,257
 george merritt of the canadian 
 hockey team winnipeg victorias 

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,525
       was the first-ever       
       hockey goaltender        

9
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,728
     to wear pads to protect    
            his legs.           

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,529
  he and those who followed him 

11
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,466
         used pads from         
    another sport -- cricket.   

12
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,469
     wider pads specifically    
for ice hockey didn't come about

13
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:11,937
        until the 1920s.        

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,077
       this company spends      
         $40,000 a year         

15
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,812
   on research and development  
         of goalie pads.        

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,348
      it redesigns its pads     
         every two years        

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,552
    to upgrade to the latest    
   materials and construction.  

18
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,754
         each goalie pad        
       has 100 components.      

19
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,223
    the factory uses hundreds   
          of metal dies         

20
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,492
    to cut parts to make pads   
          in 15 sizes.          

21
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,296
workers position the appropriate
      dies on the material.     

22
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,898
       a hydraulic machine      
   applies roughly the weight   

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,033
      of four elephants --      

24
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,769
    forcing the dies through    
   up to four layers at once.   

25
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,438
    here, it's a synthetic,     
    water-repellent material    

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
      called p.u. leather.      

27
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,609
      the machine also cuts     
      various types of foam     

28
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,512
   for structure, protection,   
          and comfort.          

29
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,447
      and it creates holes,     
         called eyelets,        

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,382
      for laces or buttons.     

31
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,385
  here, the machine cuts soft,  
        low-density foam,       

32
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,923
 which acts as a shock absorber 
 against the force of the puck. 

33
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,257
      workers sew the pads      

34
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,927
    using industrial-strength   
        nylon stitching.        

35
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,203
  to protect the p.u. leather,  
  they sew on a layer of foam   

36
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,539
        that's an eighth        
        of an inch thick,       

37
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,275
     and zippers on openings    
       that will be packed      

38
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,344
       with shredded foam       
         for a snug fit.        

39
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,547
   they use a half-inch-thick   
      layer of spongy foam      

40
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,683
      to line the player's      
      knee and calf areas       

41
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,819
  for flexibility and comfort.  

42
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,755
     the stitching is purely    
           decorative.          

43
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,632
  the factory often embroiders  
        the player's name       

44
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,902
 on the goalie pads to identify 
     the gear if it's lost.     

45
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,171
         this automated         
       embroidery machine       

46
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,106
  has 12 computer-guided heads. 

47
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,842
   they use up to 40 different  
         thread colors.         

48
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,111
    every year, this factory    
   produces up to 3,500 pairs   

49
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,048
         of goalie pads.        

50
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,785
  the players wear an array of  
 corporate logos on their pads. 

51
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,921
 it's all part of the commercial
       nature of the game       

52
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,056
        and the industry.       

53
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,399
         now they sew on        
       a zippered pocket,       

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,503
  which, when filled with foam, 
   will protect the calf area.  

55
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,540
 they use water-resistant fabric

56
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,076
        to cover the back       
       of the player's leg      

57
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,811
        and line the area       
      with low-density foam     

58
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,547
  to absorb the puck's impact.  

59
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,483
     then they attach flaps,    
      called knee raisers,      

60
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,151
    to protect the knee area.   

61
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,355
  good thing, given that pucks  
      will slam the goalie      

62
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,924
        at a speed of up        
     to 100 miles per hour.     

63
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,695
         next, they sew         
    the front and back parts    

64
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,130
      of the pads together.     

65
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,502
  then they hot-glue a sandwich 
         of harder foam         

66
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:01,239
     for structural support,    
 soft foam for shock absorbency,

67
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,841
     and an even softer foam    
          for comfort.          

68
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,612
       this padding forms       
      the guts of the pad.      

69
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,118
 using crimpers, workers fasten 
 the pads together temporarily. 

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,455
          then they use         
      a 7-inch-long needle      

71
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,724
    with a diamond-shaped tip   
   to sew the layers together.  

72
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,395
 the worker threads the layers, 
  uniting them into one piece.  

73
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,865
 this process is called lasting.

74
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,668
  workers now pack the outside  
        of the goalie pad       

75
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,203
      with more rigid foam      
          for structure         

76
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,705
  and softer foam for comfort.  

77
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,879
  they use clamps to fasten the 
 boot area together temporarily,

78
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,948
while inserting shredded foam --

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,951
  shredded because it's easier  
         to squeeze in.         

80
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,023
    then, using a specialized   
         sewing machine,        

81
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,092
  they sew the outermost shell  
           of the pad.          

82
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,562
 this is considered the toughest
      part of the assembly,     

83
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,165
      since it joins layers     
      as thick as an inch.      

84
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,570
     they use pliers to hold    
   the pieces tightly together  

85
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:09,975
during the 45 minutes or so that
  it takes to sew just one pad. 

86
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,715
    after trimming the excess   
         from the ends,         

87
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,917
       workers cover them       
 with a strip of p.u. leather --

88
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,586
    a process called capping.   

89
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,056
   they attach the strip using  
   13 overlapping stitches --   

90
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,660
 a durability feature that gives
   the goalie pads long life.   

91
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,529
        next, they insert       
     a removable knee guard,    

92
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,465
      which can be adjusted     
      or replaced later on.     

93
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,002
     using a rivet machine,     
   they attach a leather strap  

94
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,804
 to an adjustable nylon buckle. 

95
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,273
  it's an important component.  

96
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,942
  this is what fastens the pads 
           to the leg.          

97
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,479
    and at a price of nearly    
         $1,600 a pair,         

98
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,882
    you, too, can stop those    
 speeding pucks with confidence.

99
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,825
      narrator: lapel pins      
    let you proudly show off    

100
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,094
        where you've been       
       or where you stand,      

101
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,098
  from an event you've attended 
    or your political beliefs   

102
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,102
to your professional affiliation
  or your favorite sports team. 

103
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,704
     lapel pins cost pennies    
           to produce,          

104
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,441
  but some are collectors items 
   worth thousands of dollars.  

105
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,981
        they may be tiny,       

106
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,316
      but they're out there     
        in huge numbers.        

107
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,918
   this one company churns out  

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,120
         about 5 million        
       lapel pins a year.       

109
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,723
  it all starts with the sketch 
        of the pin design       

110
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,391
  and from that, the master --  

111
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,128
  a negative made of magnesium, 
        a type of metal.        

112
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,196
       they'll make copies      
         of this master         

113
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,798
  to create a production mold.  

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,334
 but first, using what's called 
          a coping saw,         

115
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,237
     they cut out the front     
 and back pieces of the master. 

116
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,480
using a dispenser about the size
       of a sewing needle,      

117
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,082
  they glue the pieces together 
           with epoxy.          

118
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,951
  it takes five minutes to dry. 

119
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,687
  then they cast enough copies  
          of the master         

120
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,288
    to fill up a rubber disk.   

121
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,890
   after tracing the outlines,  

122
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,826
 a worker uses a surgical knife 

123
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,361
    to meticulously carve out   
          the cavities.         

124
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,697
      he softens the rubber     
       with paint thinner,      

125
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,833
    to enable precision cuts.   

126
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:19,170
      then he places a copy     
  of the master in each cavity. 

127
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,105
    another disk goes on top,   

128
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,376
 then it's into a machine called
   a vulcanizer for one hour.   

129
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,245
        this machine uses       
        heat and pressure       

130
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:31,115
       to cure the rubber,      
making it as hard as a car tire.

131
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,718
    it also melds the rubber    
    around each master copy,    

132
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
      embedding the detail.     

133
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,455
          this will be          
       the production mold      

134
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,457
 for producing this pin design. 

135
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,394
   now, using a surgical knife  
      again for precision,      

136
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,794
    they carve out sprues --    

137
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,398
         channels that,         
   during the casting process,  

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
     will direct the flow of    
  molten metal to the cavities. 

139
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,603
     they also make smaller     
curved channels, called runners,

140
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,006
      to filter out any air     
       or dirt particles.       

141
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,543
    it's crucial to position    
the sprues and runners correctly

142
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,346
        because this mold       
     produces an entire line    

143
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,814
      of a particular pin.      

144
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,218
   mess up, and they'd have to  
  remake the mold from scratch. 

145
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,360
        next, they insert       
  a half-inch-long brass tack,  

146
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,362
called a post, into each cavity.

147
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:22,166
 it'll later fasten to a clasp, 
 attaching the pin to clothing. 

148
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,569
      the post goes in now,     
       rather than later,       

149
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:28,039
so that it will fuse to the back
of the lapel pin during casting.

150
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,310
     now, to close the mold,    

151
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,378
     they align the buttons     
           on one half          

152
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,648
      with the depressions      
       in the other half.       

153
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,085
 the mold then goes into what's 
 called a spin casting machine. 

154
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,327
using a cast-iron ladle that can
withstand the fiery temperature,

155
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,329
  they pour in molten metal --  

156
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,932
      either pewter, zinc,      
         or a tin alloy.        

157
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,066
      as the machine spins,     

158
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,669
        centrifugal force       
        propels the metal       

159
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,338
   into every nook and cranny   
        of the cavities.        

160
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,341
  after a minute of spinning -- 
        400 rotations --        

161
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,543
       the mold comes out.      

162
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,180
   the metal takes about five   
   minutes to cool and harden.  

163
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,864
 the factory re-melts the excess
    metal for the next batch.   

164
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,570
      next, a brass clasp,      
        called a clutch,        

165
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,139
       goes onto the post.      

166
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,577
       now the lapel pins       
    go for an hour-long wash    

167
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,313
        in soap and water       
      and abrasive stones.      

168
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,016
      the stones smooth out     
        any rough edges.        

169
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,057
        the pins go into        
     the electroplating tank    

170
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,058
 for a surface coating of metal.

171
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,729
  how many coats and the types  
 of metal vary with the design. 

172
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,365
       an electric current      
    draws the metal particles   

173
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,733
         onto the pins,         
    plating them thoroughly.    

174
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,936
      these pins first get      
         copper plating,        

175
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,407
      then nickel plating,      
       then gold plating.       

176
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,214
     now it's time to paint     
         the lapel pins.        

177
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,482
         workers follow         
       a numerical guide,       

178
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,217
  like a paint-by-numbers kit.  

179
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,420
       they paint each pin      
          individually,         

180
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,889
     using minute quantities    
         of epoxy paint.        

181
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,892
 they control the paint syringe 
       with a foot pedal.       

182
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,033
      once the paint dries,     

183
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,369
        a machine called        
a pad printer gathers up the ink

184
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,371
 and stamps on the tiny details,

185
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,841
       the ones too small       
       to paint by hand.        

186
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:51,649
 pierce the post through fabric,
   secure it with the clutch,   

187
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,853
       and this lapel pin       
      is now ready to wear.     

188
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,663
            narrator:           
      like many inventions,     

189
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,466
   the cardboard box was born   
       by sheer accident.       

190
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,601
          in the 1870s,         

191
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,003
       an american printer      
   by the name of robert gair   

192
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,671
     stumbled upon the idea.    

193
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,008
   by mistake, he cut a paper   
    seed bag he was creasing    

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,276
       with a metal ruler.      

195
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,945
 gair concluded he could create 
      a sturdier container      

196
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,080
        with paperboard.        

197
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,754
         cardboard boxes        
     come in a wide variety     

198
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,556
  of sizes, shapes, and colors. 

199
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,625
   but most share three basic   
    structural components --    

200
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,095
    one wavy sheet of paper,    
         called a flute,        

201
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,231
     sandwiched between two     
   flat sheets, called liners.  

202
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,502
together they form what's called
       a corrugated board.      

203
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,905
        production starts       
       with a massive roll      

204
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,639
  of partially recycled paper.  

205
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,241
 the width of the paper varies, 

206
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,843
      depending on the size     
  of the boxes they're making.  

207
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,179
    the roll feeds a machine    
      called a corrugator.      

208
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,049
  the machine presses the paper 
   between two ridged rollers   

209
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,584
  and blasts it with hot steam. 

210
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,586
      this shapes the waves     
          of the flute.         

211
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,789
   another roller applies glue  
    to one side of the flute.   

212
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,725
   the glue's main ingredients  
      are water and starch,     

213
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,928
     which won't contaminate    
          fresh produce         

214
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,662
  the boxes may later contain.  

215
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,733
    next, the machine adheres   
       one liner sheet...       

216
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,270
     ...and then the other.     

217
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,738
 the waves create an air cushion

218
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,406
        between the flute       
         and the liners,        

219
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,142
    strengthening the board.    

220
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,210
 for added strength, some boxes 
     have a double lining --    

221
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,479
  two flutes and three liners.  

222
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,482
       the flutes may also      
        vary in thickness       

223
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,950
  for more or less cushioning.  

224
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,953
   the factory uses partially   
  recycled paper for the flutes 

225
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:39,023
   because it's more malleable  
    than non-recycled paper.    

226
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,559
    a razor-thin circular saw   
        trims each side.        

227
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,363
   the corrugator machine then  
cuts the board up to nine times,

228
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,032
depending on the size of the box
       they're producing.       

229
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,036
 the corrugator's final function

230
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,239
    is to separate the boards   
          into layers,          

231
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,908
  using flexible aluminum tongs 
         called fingers.        

232
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,043
           workers do           
     a quality-control check    

233
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,247
    before sending the boards   
        off for printing.       

234
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,783
        the next machine        
        stacks the boards       

235
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,986
into piles of between 25 and 80,
  depending on their thickness. 

236
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,255
     this machine also feeds    
       one board at a time      

237
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,590
   to the upcoming equipment.   

238
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,925
          it does this          
      at lightning speed --     

239
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,595
         at a rate of up        
    to 8,000 boards per hour.   

240
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,806
        first, a trimmer        
      perforates the boards     

241
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,341
  to create flaps and handles.  

242
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,277
         rubber sponges         
       cushion the blades       

243
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,180
 so that they cut only the parts
      they're supposed to.      

244
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,483
      during the trimming,      

245
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,520
  a press condenses the boxes'  
       overlapping panels       

246
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,421
  to level out their thickness. 

247
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,024
       workers usually cut      
       the sponges by hand      

248
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,094
  to make sure they fit snugly  
       around the blades.       

249
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,097
   the trimmer runs at a speed  
       of 5 miles an hour,      

250
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,633
    processing up to 90 boxes   
           per minute.          

251
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,240
    workers send the cutoffs    
     back to the paper mill     

252
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,810
         to be recycled         
   as many as six times over.   

253
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,250
a folding machine now bends them
        along score lines       

254
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,186
  the corrugator made earlier.  

255
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,388
    it then applies cold glue   
         to the sections        

256
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,590
      that'll join together     
        to form the box,        

257
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,393
    hot glue if the cardboard   
         is wax-coated.         

258
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,064
     the next machine folds     
    over the glued sections.    

259
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,701
       they aren't visible      
    once the box is finished.   

260
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,606
     another machine stacks     
       the boxes in piles.      

261
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,675
         a separator arm        
        moves the bundles       

262
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,044
     to trays, called skids,    
          for shipping.         

263
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,414
 the printing of the boxes began
  in the factory's ink kitchen. 

264
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,016
   a computer-guided dispenser  

265
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,352
           squirts out          
    different shades of ink,    

266
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,554
   following a precise recipe   
  to create a particular color, 

267
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,057
  one of 5,000 in the palette.  

268
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:01,298
 one pail holds about 45 pounds 
       of printing ink --       

269
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,368
     enough for 2,000 boxes,    

270
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,903
          depending on          
      the coverage needed.      

271
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,041
the factory uses water-based ink
   because it dries instantly.  

272
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,910
       the printing press       
 applies the ink to the boards, 

273
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,445
   one color group at a time,   

274
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,580
    through four consecutive    
            stations.           

275
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,584
this factory uses a flexographic
        printing system,        

276
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,854
    a process that can print    
   drawings and illustrations.  

277
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,790
       some companies use       
      a lithographic press,     

278
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,859
      which can also print      
          photographs.          

279
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,067
   back on the trimming line,   

280
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,003
     more complicated types     
    of box flaps and handles    

281
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,606
      require what's called     
       a flatbed trimmer.       

282
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,941
       it holds the boards      
      in place with suction     

283
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,677
     while making intricate     
          perforations.         

284
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,679
after removing the trimmed bits,

285
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,615
     workers give the boxes     
     one last quality check.    

286
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,950
      then they stack them      

287
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,286
        and send them off       
        to the warehouse.       

288
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,769
  narrator: the main ingredient 
    in glass is silica sand.    

289
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,438
        when you heat it        
   along with other chemicals,  

290
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,173
  it turns into a syrupy liquid 

291
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,310
 that you can then mold or blow 
    into a particular shape.    

292
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,779
         add lead oxide         
  and you've got lead crystal.  

293
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,981
        it's much softer        
       than regular glass,      

294
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,185
  making it easier to decorate  
  with intricate cut designs,   

295
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,253
   to enhance its brilliance.   

296
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,255
         [ glass dings ]        

297
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,326
         craftsmen start        
        with silica sand,       

298
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,528
      which is a very pure      
          type of sand.         

299
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,765
   then they add nickel oxide   
  to help the silica sand melt, 

300
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,468
lead oxide, potassium carbonate,
potassium nitrate, and antimony,

301
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,137
  to give the finished crystal  

302
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,206
         its smoothness,        
       heft, and sparkle.       

303
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,474
      they compress the mix     
          into pellets.         

304
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,543
      they heat the pellets     
          for 18 hours,         

305
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,679
 creating a mass of molten glass
  that they can call the melt.  

306
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,947
   to that, they add cullet --  

307
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,151
      the term for excess,      
  broken, or rejected crystal.  

308
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,752
  cullet smoothes out the melt. 

309
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,021
        a blower now uses       
      a hollow blowing iron     

310
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,358
made of tempered stainless steel
  to collect some of the melt.  

311
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,695
 he constantly rotates the iron 
   so the melt clings together  

312
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,096
   in what's called a gather.   

313
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,165
   the blower rolls the gather  
   on a heat-resistant table.   

314
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,569
   this sparks a flame because  
the table is coated with beeswax

315
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,039
  to prevent the molten crystal 
         from sticking.         

316
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,906
   the blower exhales a slow,   
      steady breath of air      

317
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,043
to create the base of the piece,
        called the ball.        

318
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,112
      after letting it cool     
         for 90 seconds,        

319
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,047
        he dips the ball        
       back in the furnace      

320
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,517
  to coat it with another layer 
       of molten crystal.       

321
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,453
    this fortifies the ball.    

322
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,655
 now he begins shaping the ball,
   using various wooden tools.  

323
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,057
   this one's called a block.   

324
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,793
he uses another tool, a divider,
        to create grooves       

325
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,795
        so the ball will        
        fit into a mold.        

326
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,065
        the blower soaks        
    the wooden tools in water   

327
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,466
       so they won't burn.      

328
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,269
     he now inserts the ball    
       into a steel mold,       

329
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,138
  one of 150 this company uses  
       for its collection.      

330
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,541
  the craftsmen coat the inside 
     of the mold beforehand     

331
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,546
   with a paste of cork dust,   
 linseed oil, and charcoal dust.

332
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,414
     this prevents the ball     
         from sticking,         

333
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,349
     which would cause flaws    
         in the crystal.        

334
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,618
  the blower releases the ball, 
      now called the bowl,      

335
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,752
       using a foot pedal.      

336
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,222
     after cooling the bowl     
         for one minute,        

337
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,691
       another craftsman,       
       called a stemmer,        

338
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,161
  adds another gather to create 
   the stem of the wineglass.   

339
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:20,832
       he clips the gather      
  with heat-resistant scissors. 

340
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,767
    he uses a wooden divider    
     to shape the stem area     

341
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,303
       and a metal divider      
      to stretch the gather     

342
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,905
   into the shape of the stem.  

343
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,176
       the stemmer must be      
         highly skilled.        

344
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,512
   there's no mold or pattern   
           to follow.           

345
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:38,916
 he relies entirely on eyesight,
    intuition, and patience.    

346
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,124
        he cools the stem       
  with layers of wet newspaper. 

347
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,728
 they absorb heat well and don't
      leave marks or flaws.     

348
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,131
     next, another craftsman    
        adds more gather        

349
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,866
to create the foot of the glass.

350
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,802
     he uses a wooden tool,     
         called a pitch,        

351
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,470
      to flatten the foot.      

352
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,141
 he also shapes the foot by hand

353
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,943
       with wet newspaper.      

354
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,413
   this metal template ensures  

355
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,016
         it's generally         
      the right dimensions.     

356
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,819
 everything is handmade, so each
   piece may differ slightly.   

357
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,622
  this company makes 20 models  
           of glasses,          

358
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,424
   including different styles   

359
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,927
         for red, white,        
      port, and ice wines.      

360
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,634
 the piece then goes into a kiln
   at 840 degrees fahrenheit.   

361
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,369
     at the end of the day,     
    they switch off the kiln    

362
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,705
       to let the glasses       
    gradually cool overnight    

363
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,507
      to room temperature.      

364
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,443
    the next day, a craftsman   
     uses an acetylene torch    

365
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,645
        to cut the glass        
       and remove the cap.      

366
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,582
they use an old record turntable
    to spin the glass around    

367
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,183
        and make the cut.       

368
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,319
         for precision,         
  they smooth and bevel the rim 

369
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,921
      with a diamond-coated     
         steel grinder.         

370
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,990
       another craftsman,       
        called a cutter,        

371
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:55,325
        marks out a grid        
     with a waterproof pen.     

372
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,261
      he uses another type      
          of turntable          

373
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,596
 to steady his hand as he draws.

374
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,199
   it's not an exact pattern,   

375
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,936
   just a general guideline to  
 create the design of the piece.

376
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,274
      this design's called      
          the titanic.          

377
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,544
  it's based on a light fixture 
      from the ocean liner.     

378
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,480
    water cools, lubricates,    
       and cleans the area      

379
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,681
         during cutting.        

380
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,684
     there are two types of     
   cutting -- wedge and flat.   

381
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,554
      wedge cutting creates     
    the deep, intricate cuts.   

382
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,556
 flat cutting creates smoother, 
        less-angled cuts.       

383
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,426
here, they use the wedge method,

384
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,495
     which can only be done     
   with diamond-tipped wheels.  

385
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,432
    here, the cutter creates    
     a diamond-shaped grid,     

386
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,933
       called a karo cut.       

387
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,373
       finally, the cutter      
    creates a star-shaped cut   

388
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,043
    spanning the entire foot    
          of the glass.         

389
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,446
      once the decorations      
          are complete,         

390
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,448
        an inspector does       
    a detailed quality check,   

391
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,784
before etching the company logo.
