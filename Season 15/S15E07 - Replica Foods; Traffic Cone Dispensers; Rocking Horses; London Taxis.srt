1
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,386
            narrator:           
  this meal may look delicious, 

2
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,722
     but it actually tastes     
          like plastic.         

3
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,190
       this is fake food.       

4
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,793
     it's not for tasting --    
       it's for tempting.       

5
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,461
   restaurants and food stores  

6
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,064
      use these imitations      
      to entice customers.      

7
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,467
     fake food is also used     
    as props in movies and tv   

8
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,336
  because the camera loves it.  

9
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:17,209
    this fake food will keep    
 that fresh-cooked look forever.

10
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,811
           that means           
     there will be no waste     

11
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,380
       from the restaurant      
          display case.         

12
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,754
 these authentic-looking fakes  
 start out with the real thing. 

13
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,624
 in this case, it's a sea bass. 

14
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,694
 the worker blots up excess oil 
         from the skin.         

15
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:38,631
    he then uses an adhesive    
        to glue the fish        

16
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,333
  to the base of a wooden box.  

17
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,476
   next, he immerses the fish   
       in liquid silicone.      

18
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:01,853
         24 hours later,        
   after the silicone is set,   

19
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,857
     he breaks open the box     
     and removes the fish.      

20
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,929
 this detailed silicone negative

21
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,467
 can now be used to mold exact  
 replicas of the original fish. 

22
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:20,205
      they preheat the mold     
  until it's warm to the touch. 

23
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,475
   this kick-starts the curing  
     of this liquid plastic,    

24
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,511
 which they pour into the mold. 

25
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,216
    once the mold is filled,    

26
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:34,820
 they zap it in a microwave oven
         for 45 seconds.        

27
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,690
    it solidifies the plastic   
         significantly,         

28
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:39,891
       but it still needs       
       a bit more curing,       

29
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,662
   so the worker transfers it   
         to a conveyor.         

30
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,433
       it carries the mold      
          under a lamp,         

31
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,137
 whose intense energy completes 
   the curing of the plastic.   

32
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,377
     the worker now extracts    
  the mold and plastic replica. 

33
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,047
   spillover from the molding   
 has created a few ragged edges,

34
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,750
        so he trims them        
   with a pair of scissors...   

35
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,823
    ...then grinds the edges    
    to smooth away the rest.    

36
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:18,330
    he also uses the grinder    
     to do some contouring.     

37
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,135
   now for the real artistry.   

38
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:26,739
 the worker sprays silvery paint
     onto the plastic bass.     

39
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,675
    it gives the fish scales    
  a lifelike, luminous texture. 

40
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,344
    a bit of dark-gray paint    

41
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,614
           brings out           
     the silvery undercoat.     

42
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,889
brown paint on the tail and fins
 make them look more realistic. 

43
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:50,696
    using an artist's brush,    
       he paints the eyes.      

44
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:54,433
    he brushes on fine lines    
 that look like natural creases 

45
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,737
   and adds some other typical  
       sea-bass markings.       

46
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,243
     a coat of lacquer keeps    
     the paint from chipping    

47
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,312
     and makes the sea bass     
           look moist.          

48
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:11,850
        now the sea bass        

49
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,220
      will always look like     
      the catch of the day.     

50
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:19,959
     and unlike a real fish,    
  it won't start to decompose.  

51
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:26,966
   at this faux-food factory,   
     there are 3,500 molds.     

52
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,540
      each one can be used      
        hundreds of times       

53
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,878
 and will produce an exact copy 
   of the original every time.  

54
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,613
           for things           
     like meat and potatoes,    

55
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,549
         they add color         
      to the liquid plastic     

56
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,083
   before they do the molding.  

57
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,685
     this reduces the amount    
           of painting          

58
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,487
    they'll need to do later.   

59
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:52,357
it takes some trial and error to
  get the pigments just right,  

60
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,428
but when they do, this fake meal
    looks good enough to eat.   

61
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,838
 they drizzle the beef and side 
 dishes with gravy-colored glue 

62
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,176
    that makes the fake food    
      adhere to the plate.      

63
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,784
     now that they've pulled    
       this meal together,      

64
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,955
   it should never come apart.  

65
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:31,530
    it takes a couple of days   
  to produce all these dishes,  

66
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,332
    but it should be worth it   
 because, compared to real food,

67
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,535
      it will last forever.     

68
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,621
     narrator: traffic cones    
  create a necessary diversion. 

69
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,892
     they keep drivers away     
   from dangerous situations.   

70
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,160
      but sending workers       
      out onto the highway      

71
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,697
     to set up those cones      
     can be a perilous job.     

72
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,631
now there's an automated machine

73
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,034
       that both dispenses      
       and collects cones       

74
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,338
        to keep everyone        
       out of harm's way.       

75
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,176
          the automated         
     traffic cone dispenser     

76
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,111
   goes where some might fear   
           to tread --          

77
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,514
   the middle of the highway.   

78
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,450
         its robotic arm        
      swings back and forth     

79
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,920
     for a speedy deployment    
        of traffic cones.       

80
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:35,193
   to make one, workers slide   
      three big metal disks     

81
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,330
          onto a shaft          
  and space them evenly apart.  

82
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:42,000
       they pull a string       
       from disk to disk        

83
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,203
           to confirm           
     all three are aligned.     

84
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,940
     once they're in place,     

85
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:52,210
    a worker welds the disks    
          to the shaft.         

86
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,748
they reinforce this installation
    job with several braces,    

87
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,219
welding five to each disk at the
point where it meets the shaft. 

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,560
       they spin the shaft      
      and inspect the work.     

89
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,898
  next, they install the tracks 

90
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,101
  that will shuttle the traffic 
    cones to the robotic arm.   

91
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,039
      they weld 13 of them      
          to the disks.         

92
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,109
 the framework for the automatic
     traffic cone dispenser     

93
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:28,980
        is now complete,        
so it's over to the paint booth.

94
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,117
     they prime and paint it    
         bright yellow,         

95
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,920
  so it will be clearly visible 
         on the highway.        

96
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,657
       here, a technician       

97
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,660
         then assembles         
     the main control panel.    

98
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:45,197
     it's the brains behind     
   the cone-dispensing robot.   

99
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,799
 the technician connects cables 

100
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,868
       that deliver power       
         to the motors.         

101
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,204
      he installs a series      
     of switches and relays     

102
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,940
  that will activate the motors 
      that rotate the drum,     

103
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,877
     swing the robotic arm,     
 and deliver the traffic cones. 

104
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,882
        finally, he tests       
      the circuit breakers      

105
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,219
           to confirm           
    that all systems are go.    

106
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,954
    down the production line,   

107
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,623
this worker attaches the gripper
           to the arm.          

108
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,296
 a pivot bolt allows the gripper
       to open and close,       

109
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,966
   and this chain will keep it  
        pointed downward,       

110
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,069
   so it's always in position   
   to deploy a traffic cone.    

111
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:30,442
he tightens the turnbuckles and 
then checks the chain's tension.

112
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,579
  he swings the arm to confirm  

113
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:39,184
     that it and the gripper    
          move freely.          

114
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,053
now he installs the transmission

115
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:44,390
          for the motor         
that will move this robotic arm.

116
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,859
        finally, he snaps       
         a retainer ring        

117
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,761
  onto the transmission shaft.  

118
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,335
     two workers then carry     
   a heavy extender mechanism   

119
00:08:56,337 --> 00:09:00,072
     over to the gripper arm    
  and bolt the mechanism to it. 

120
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,541
          this extender         
    will both support the arm   

121
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,142
   and allow it to move easily  

122
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,845
 from one side of the dispenser 
          to the other.         

123
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,018
        a sensor device,        
       called an encoder,       

124
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,723
 will keep track of the gripper 
arm's position when it's moving.

125
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,559
         the technician         
     then installs the motor    

126
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,361
 that will power the gripper arm

127
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,696
     to oscillate and deploy    
       the traffic cones.       

128
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,503
  once the gripper arm has been 
 attached to the cone dispenser,

129
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,705
    they mount the whole unit   
          on a trailer,         

130
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:37,375
    with the main control box   
          on the front.         

131
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,044
    they adjust the settings    
   for traffic-cone deployment  

132
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,448
       and put the machine      
     through all its paces.     

133
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,418
          this test run         
   ensures that all the parts   

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,688
    are functioning properly.   

135
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,730
       a technician tweaks      
 the machine's computer program 

136
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,333
          to fine-tune          
    the drop-off coordinates.   

137
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,002
 after all, releasing the cones 
            too soon            

138
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,071
   could cause them to topple.  

139
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,212
 every automatic cone dispenser 

140
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,881
      undergoes a road test     
       on the open highway      

141
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,951
 to confirm that it will perform
       in real conditions.      

142
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,891
  the driver activates it from  
  the safety of the truck cab,  

143
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,260
    while the robotic system    
       is at center line,       

144
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:31,830
      doing all the lifting     
    and taking all the risks.   

145
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,831
   if they find a problem now,  

146
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,835
     they'll send it back to    
 the factory for modifications, 

147
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,571
    but this machine handles    
    the drop-offs and pickups   

148
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,772
         with precision,        

149
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,742
         and that means         
  it's ready for traffic duty.  

150
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,456
     narrator: the ancestors    
      of toy rocking horses     

151
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,326
    may be the wooden horses    
  on wheels of the middle ages, 

152
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,128
 on which knights would practice
     their jousting skills.     

153
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,065
    child-sized wooden horses   
      on bow-shaped rockers     

154
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,068
 emerged in england and germany 
          in the 1700s,         

155
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,672
when queen victoria famously had
   dapple-gray rocking horses   

156
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,374
     made for her children.     

157
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,545
   this rocking-horse company   
           in the u.k.          

158
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,482
handcrafts antique reproductions
         and originals.         

159
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,684
            some have           
    traditional bow rockers,    

160
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,288
  but most glide back and forth 
       on a safety stand.       

161
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,957
       the horses are made      
      of durable hardwoods,     

162
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,626
       such as oak, maple,      
         and tulipwood.         

163
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,295
     after cutting off knots    
       and other defects,       

164
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,965
     workers run each piece     
        through a ripsaw,       

165
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,866
      slicing off the rough     
       and discolored wood      

166
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,368
     directly under the bar.    

167
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,903
    then they cut the pieces    
    into 12-inch-wide blocks,   

168
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:50,041
  and with a planer, slice off  
      a thin layer of wood.     

169
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,444
     this makes the surfaces    
        nice and smooth.        

170
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,981
      these are the blocks      

171
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,851
  with which they'll construct  
     the horse's main body.     

172
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,987
  to make the legs, an artisan  

173
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:05,256
      lays a template on an     
  as-yet-unplaned piece of wood 

174
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,524
         and traces it.         

175
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,394
       then he cuts along       
 the trace line with a band saw 

176
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,730
        and runs the leg        
       through the planer.      

177
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,066
 each leg has a protruding piece
      on top called a tenon     

178
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,670
  that fits into a slot called  
a mortise beneath the main body.

179
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,873
  to build the body, they roll  
    glue onto the body blocks   

180
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,075
 and assemble one to the other, 

181
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,212
building a large rectangular box
   with a hole at the center.   

182
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,614
       this hole reduces        
       the horse's weight       

183
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,549
 and relieves structural stress.

184
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,218
    in some models, the hole    

185
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,021
           also serves          
as a secret locking compartment.

186
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:40,292
   after clamping the assembly  
and letting it set for 24 hours,

187
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,360
    they coat each leg tenon    
            with glue           

188
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,029
  and insert it into a mortise. 

189
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:47,131
  after rough-carving the body, 

190
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,034
   a highly skilled craftsman   

191
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,836
   outlines the head features   
          in pencil --          

192
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,972
      cheekbones, nostrils,     
          eyes, teeth.          

193
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,574
         then he begins         
       the meticulous task      

194
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,177
      of carving the horse      
         to completion,         

195
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,314
        hitting a mallet        
    against a u-shaped gouge.   

196
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:06,151
this painstaking carving process
       takes 2 to 3 days.       

197
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,590
      now, after inserting      
          a glass eye,          

198
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,258
 he rough-files the whole horse 

199
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,794
     using a rasp to remove     
      all the gouge marks.      

200
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,264
  this takes another few hours. 

201
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,333
        then he smoothes        
       the entire surface       

202
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,802
     with an electric sander    
        four times over,        

203
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,939
    using progressively finer   
           sandpapers.          

204
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,542
        he does the final       
   sanding touch-ups by hand.   

205
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,011
   the wood is now ready to be  
         either stained         

206
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,748
          or painted to         
 the customer's specifications. 

207
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,150
       if it's the latter,      

208
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:42,153
 the artist first applies a coat
     of water-based primer,     

209
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,756
     then, for this client's    
          custom order,         

210
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,026
   a coat of light-blue paint   
 that turns gray when varnished.

211
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,299
once the background color dries,
   he hand-stipples a pattern.  

212
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,834
        after the surface       
     is varnished and waxed,    

213
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,771
      he dresses the horse      
   in a suede saddle blanket.   

214
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,342
 he uses brass tacks to affix it
     along the leather trim.    

215
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:08,613
         next, he nails         
  the leather saddle in place.  

216
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,652
    he squeezes globs of glue   

217
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,254
           into a slot          
  running down the horse's neck 

218
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:20,058
      and inserts the mane,     
  a weft of genuine horsehair.  

219
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,233
   then he nails it in place.   

220
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,612
     now he applies glue to     
 the tail hole and fits a tail, 

221
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,814
  also made of real horsehair.  

222
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,424
   now they begin constructing  
        the safety stand,       

223
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,559
   on which the rocking horse   
           will glide.          

224
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,894
       to make the posts,       

225
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,663
  they turn cylindrical blocks  
       of wood on a lathe.      

226
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,635
  then they assemble the posts  
 to the other parts of the stand

227
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,538
       and stain the wood.      

228
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,510
 they apply two coats of varnish

229
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:14,780
and let the stand dry overnight.

230
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,649
    they install the stand's    
  stained and varnished gliders 

231
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,851
      and mount the horse.      

232
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,087
        they drill a hole       
  through each hoof and glider, 

233
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,524
         then join them         
      with a nut and bolt.      

234
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,527
     the gliders connect to     
 the front and back of the frame

235
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,930
 with plated steel swing irons. 

236
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,965
            the angle           
   at which the irons are set   

237
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:37,002
             ensures            
   a continuous smooth glide.   

238
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,603
         so even though         
      these rocking horses      

239
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,539
     are built to withstand     
    the weight of two adults,   

240
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,476
  riding them is child's play.  

241
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,159
   narrator: with curved lines  
      and classic styling,      

242
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,628
    the black cabs of london    

243
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,764
 are internationally recognized 
        as british icons.       

244
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,302
 many say the london taxi system
    is the best in the world,   

245
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,103
  and for many london visitors, 

246
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,972
    a taxi ride is more than    
     just transportation --     

247
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,542
    it's a tourist attraction   
          unto itself.          

248
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,314
      the modern black cab      
        was born in 1948.       

249
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,051
        today, there are        
     about 20,000 black cabs    

250
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,852
    on the streets of london.   

251
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,723
 because the taxi can easily be 
 driven 30,000 miles each year, 

252
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:35,526
   the cars need to be robust.  

253
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,531
  to start, operators position  
    steel panels into a press   

254
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,400
      that uses hydraulics      
 and air pressure to fold them. 

255
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,739
       the press can apply      
     up to 800 tons of force    

256
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,542
        to fold and form        
     each chassis component.    

257
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,678
          once they get         
   their 3-dimensional shape,   

258
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,681
        the supple panels       
    become stiff side rails.    

259
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:06,157
      welders then assemble     
 two side rail with a cruciform 

260
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,426
 to create the chassis assembly.

261
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,030
they clamp the side rails firmly
  in place before welding them. 

262
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,580
          the taxi uses         
 a 4-cylinder, direct-injection,

263
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,350
     turbodiesel engine that    
 is hoisted in with the gearbox.

264
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:38,189
 then they connect the radiator 
 hoses and pipes to the engine. 

265
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,799
 the axles, wheels, suspension, 
       and exhaust system       

266
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,734
        are now in place.       

267
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,207
     to build the components    
       of the taxi's body,      

268
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,477
  welders assemble sheet metal  
      using a spot welder.      

269
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,149
           the device           
    has two copper electrodes   

270
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,084
 that clamp the sheets together 

271
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:10,555
and concentrate electric current
       into a small spot.       

272
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,024
     forcing a large current    
        through the spot        

273
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,093
         melts the metal        
       and forms the weld.      

274
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:25,704
    now it's time to assemble   
   the taxi's sides and floor.  

275
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,907
  since the floor is completely 
   flat and the roof is high,   

276
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,843
passengers with reduced mobility

277
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,212
    can easily enter and exit   
            the taxi.           

278
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,849
    the body has been covered   

279
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,119
   with an anticorrosion coat   
       and a gray primer.       

280
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,454
         before the car         
      gets its final color,     

281
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,590
      a worker inspects it      
     for any surface damage.    

282
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,795
  infrared lamps warm the body  
 shell to 122 degrees fahrenheit

283
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,598
    to make paint application   
             easier.            

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,733
 not all london taxis are black.

285
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,469
       they spray this one      
       with yellow paint.       

286
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,905
        later, they apply       
       a shiny clear coat.      

287
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,678
        each painted car        
  moves to the polishing room.  

288
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,413
        the bright lights       
      allow the technicians     

289
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:14,018
to check for any dirt, runs, dry
  spray, or other paint defects 

290
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,388
    as they carefully polish    
            the car.            

291
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:29,100
  a worker bolts the hire sign  
          to the roof.          

292
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,936
          a rubber seal         
      prevents water leaks.     

293
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,112
 they carry the front windshield
    with rubber suction pads    

294
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,182
 and carefully put it in place. 

295
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,219
   they seal the rubber sides   
 to ensure they are watertight. 

296
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,526
the body is covered with plastic
casing to protect it from damage

297
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,896
         as it's hoisted        
     down onto the chassis.     

298
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,867
      although these taxis      
      are large and roomy,      

299
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,804
     their mandatory 28-foot    
   curb-to-curb turning circle  

300
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,275
      allows them to easily     
        perform u-turns.        

301
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,881
     a driver tests the car     
      at different speeds,      

302
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,719
         changing gears,        
 and testing the a.b.s. brakes. 

303
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:27,158
    each taxi also undergoes    
          a water test.         

304
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,595
  they check for leaks through  
 the glass and around the doors.

305
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,167
      with an access ramp       
      and fold-down seats,      

306
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,937
    it's easy for wheelchairs   
       to board the taxi.       

307
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,443
  the taxi offers enough space  
  for five seated passengers.   

308
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,379
    it takes about two weeks    
        to build a taxi.        

309
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,249
    then it's off to navigate   
     the streets of london.
