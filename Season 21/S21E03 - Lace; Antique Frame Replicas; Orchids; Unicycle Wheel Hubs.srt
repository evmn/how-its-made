   discovery communications

00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,518
           narrator:            
lace began as a fringe fabric.  

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
   back in the middle ages,     

5
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,590
 it was handcrafted by european 
 women to trim fashion finery.  

6
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,793
    the ladies' fingers got a   
             break              

7
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,530
 with the advent of lace-making 
equipment in the 19th century.  

8
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,331
     with mass production,      

9
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,468
   lace moved from the fringe   
      to the mainstream.        

10
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,341
     in the material world,     
   lace used to be a luxury,    

11
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,812
   handcrafted for decorative   
rather than practical reasons.  

12
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,948
            machines            
   now produce lace quickly,    

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,884
    and you don't have to be    
             wealthy            
         to afford it.          

14
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,020
     to manufacture lace,       

15
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,689
       hundreds of nylon        
     and polyester threads      

16
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,759
     unwind simultaneously      
       into a separator.        

17
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,896
  it arranges the threads in a  
        configuration for       
         manufacturing          

18
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:40,366
  and keeps them from tangling  
     as they move forward.      

19
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,968
  to maintain the formation,    

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,638
  the the threads pass through  
    a comb-like apparatus.      

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,574
             still              
  in that neat configuration,   

22
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,309
          the threads           
  wind around a large spool.    

23
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,712
         this spool is          
    known as a ground beam      

24
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,114
   because the threads on it    

25
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,516
          will be used          
    for the lace's ground, or   
             mesh.              

26
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,656
  these smaller spools supply   
 the threads for the pattern.   

27
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,459
        they all unwind         
 into the lace-making machine,  

28
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:10,096
 which will interweave them to  
     create a pattern on the    
            ground.             

29
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,334
    here's how it happens.      

30
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,003
       a long thick card        
  with holes punched into it    

31
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,271
      defines the pattern       

32
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,475
           and guides           
a system of hooks and needles.  

33
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,477
 it's called a jacquard card,   

34
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,279
  and the technology has been   
   around for two centuries     

35
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,550
      and was actually the      
           inspiration          
   for computer technology.     

36
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,620
     each hole on the card      
   corresponds to one hook,     

37
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,157
       and the hooks are        
 attached to these guide bars.  

38
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,296
     if the hook encounters     
 a hole in the jacquard card,   

39
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,698
      it loops a thread,        

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,234
      and if it encounters      
   the solid card, it stops.    

41
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,236
         the guide bars         
    shuffle back and forth      

42
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,506
       to move the hooks        
    in concert with needles     

43
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:56,075
      and weave the design      
        on the ground.          

44
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:03,182
    this is the lace-weaving    
             action             
        in slow motion.         

45
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,857
     the punch-card system      
  allows for the same pattern   

46
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,093
     to be woven repeatedly     
        without error.          

47
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,933
            it's all            
   perfectly choreographed,     

48
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,935
 and this complex lace design   

49
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:27,139
     comes together quickly     
        with no snarls.         

50
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,674
           the result           
    is a thing of beauty --     

51
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,279
  an intricate floral pattern   
     on a mesh background.      

52
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,485
 the lace rolls by inspectors,  

53
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,023
 who scrutinize the needlework  
          for flaws.            

54
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:49,461
  it then heads into a station  
    with high-speed knives.     

55
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,098
   they cut the loose threads   
              that              
     run between the floral     
            patterns            

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,633
   on the front of the lace.    

57
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,836
   a worker finishes the job    
           by hand,             

58
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,972
removing what the knives miss.  

59
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:03,308
      here you can see the      
           difference           
      the trimming makes.       

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,179
      the mesh between the      
           needlework           
is now completely transparent.  

61
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,649
     they mend the lace when    
            needed,             

62
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,953
   and then it's into a dying   
  machine to add some color.    

63
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,860
         after rinsing,         
  the now bright-yellow lace    

64
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,998
     travels over bars under    
             tension            
    to wring out the water.     

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,203
     the lace, still damp,      
   lands and accumulates in a   
              bin,              

66
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:36,007
     which they wheel over      
    to a finishing machine.     

67
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,344
     the finishing machine      
   is equipped with rollers.    

68
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,947
         the first ones         
remove the curl from the lace.  

69
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,950
       the others take it       
    through a chemical bath     

70
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,219
        for a treatment         
  that both softens the lace    

71
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,321
    and prevents shrinkage.     

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,629
 a trip through a dryer removes 
   the water from the fabric    

73
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,764
           and cures            
   the finishing chemicals.     

74
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:04,636
  now complete, the lace exits  
  onto a network of rollers.    

75
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,372
         the final one          
 swings the fabric to and fro   

76
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,174
so that it lands neatly folded  

77
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,277
          for transfer          
    to the packaging line.      

78
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,583
   heavy industrial machinery   
   has produced this delicate   
              lace              

79
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,053
    in a matter of minutes.     

80
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:24,322
   they roll it and wrap it,    

81
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,860
   and it's on its way to the   
     fabric store or another    
            factory.            

82
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:31,063
     no ordinary textile,       

83
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,199
 the factory-made lace will add 
 beauty to things of necessity  

84
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,202
         like curtains,         
   a tablecloth, or a dress.    

85
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,406
      its sheer good looks      
    will add visual appeal      

86
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,641
   to these ordinary items.     

87
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,696
    narrator: it's important    
     that the frame around a    
            painting            

88
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,565
  be stylistically consistent   

89
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,567
    with the period in which    
 the artist created the work.   

90
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,170
   when you're dealing with a   
     centuries-old painting,    
            however,            

91
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,439
       the original frame       
    has often been replaced     

92
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,641
       with a newer one.        

93
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,242
 the solution is commissioning  

94
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,678
    an historically accurate    
       antique replica.         

95
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,850
   when a painting's original   
              frame             
           is lost,             

96
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,519
    a specialist can produce    
       an exact replica         

97
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,522
   or a historically accurate   
         alternative.           

98
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,657
basswood is the wood of choice  

99
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,928
  because it's relatively soft  
       and even-grained.        

100
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,899
   first, they saw the length   
    required for the frame.     

101
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:46,605
   then they plane the sides    
  to smooth the rough edges.    

102
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,679
    next, they saw the piece    
  to the required dimensions.   

103
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,349
 once pieces for all four sides 
     of the frame are cut,      

104
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,151
    workers set up a machine    
   called a molding planer.     

105
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,688
  as its contoured steel blade  
            spins,              

106
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,757
   they run each piece against  
              it,               

107
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,559
  carving the blade's profile   
        into the wood.          

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,498
          the workshop          
    has thousand of blades,     

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,633
each with a different profile.  

110
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,702
         they all began         
    as a flat bar of steel,     

111
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,239
 which the shop milled to shape 
 following a profile drawing.   

112
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,976
 once each side is contoured,   

113
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:27,112
      workers saw the ends      
    at 45-degree angles...      

114
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,818
   ...then cut a slot in each   
              one.              

115
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,390
  they spread glue in the slot  
 and over the entire surface,   

116
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,659
     then insert a beechwood    
            biscuit.            

117
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,129
      the biscuit goes in       
         just halfway.          

118
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,064
  they insert the other half    

119
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,069
      into the glued slot       
 of the adjoining frame piece.  

120
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,673
      once the glue dries,      
    the master carver gets to   
             work.              

121
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,474
        with a pencil,          

122
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,278
  he draws the frame's design   
      onto tracing paper,       

123
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,147
      then lays the paper       
  upside down on the replica    

124
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,083
   and retraces the design,     

125
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:08,053
 which transfers it in graphite 
    onto the frame surface.     

126
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,358
  then he turns to his arsenal  
      of 40-plus chisels        

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,227
     and begins carving out     
          the design.           

128
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,964
        each chisel has         
   a different shape and sized  
              tip               

129
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,167
      and therefore makes       
 a very specific type of cut.   

130
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,636
  he first cuts straight down   
       along the outline        

131
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,638
   to sever the wood grain.     

132
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,441
         this prevents          
the angled cuts, which follow,  

133
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,177
    from splitting the wood     
      beyond the outline.       

134
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,978
    interchanging chisels,      

135
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,448
     he repeatedly removes      
     small chunks of wood       

136
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,584
   until the design emerges.    

137
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:42,187
 he clears away the wood chips  
      with a wire brush.        

138
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,389
     now the master gilder      
          takes over,           

139
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,859
          brushing on           
  up to 20 coats of gesso --    

140
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,261
    a traditional mixture of    
             water,             
      calcium carbonate,        

141
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,398
    and a very flexible glue    
    made from rabbit skin.      

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,467
 flexibility prevents cracking  

143
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,203
         when the wood          
    expands and contracts.      

144
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,737
   he brushes on four coats     

145
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,739
 of another traditional mixture 
         called bole.           

146
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,741
      the ingredients --        

147
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,414
    ultra-fine particle clay,   
             water,             
 and, again, rabbit-skin glue.  

148
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,550
    bole provides background    
            colors.             

149
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,485
  it also provides a cushion    

150
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,488
    between the gesso layer     
      and the gold leaf.        

151
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,691
 next, a coat of what's called  
      gilder's liquor --        

152
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,260
     a combination of water,    
            alcohol,            

153
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,096
       and either gelatin       
     or rabbit-skin glue.       

154
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,566
          then he cuts          
    a piece of gold leaf --     

155
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:32,904
 a sheet of genuine gold a mere 
    1/10,000 of a millimeter    
             thick.             

156
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,040
    he applies it with a fine   
              brush             
    made of squirrel hair,      

157
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,510
  which he has lightly oiled.   

158
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,313
 as soon as he taps the frame,  

159
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,716
    the water in the gilder's   
             liquor             
     grabs the gold leaf,       

160
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,120
 pulling it away from the oil,  
 adhering it to the bristles.   

161
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,255
   this is the tricky part,     

162
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,190
      because too much oil      
         on the brush           

163
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,259
      or too little water       
    in the gilder's liquor      

164
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,262
           can hinder           
    this delicate transfer.     

165
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,532
  next, the master gilder rubs  
         select areas           

166
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,801
     with a polished agate,     
       a natural stone.         

167
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,072
    this burnishing process     
   compresses the gold leaf,    

168
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,675
  making it smooth and shiny.   

169
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:13,412
    now he'll make the frame    
           look old.            

170
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,014
      he removes some gold      
     from the high points       

171
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,216
           to create            
    the appearance of wear.     

172
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:22,421
 then he applies a tinted glaze 
     to simulate patina --      

173
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:25,090
       natural darkening        
    that develops over time     

174
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:29,160
    due to the accumulation     
  of airborne dust and dirt.    

175
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,497
     he works in the glaze      
         with a brush           

176
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,432
to distribute it strategically  

177
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:39,304
    so that the fake patina     
   looks perfectly natural.     

178
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,841
        for this frame,         
  he uses 23-karat gold leaf.   

179
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:47,779
 gilders will also use 6-, 12-, 
  14, 18-, and 22-karat leaf    

180
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,182
           to achieve           
   different shades of gold.    

181
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,918
     the higher the karat,      
    the yellower the color,     

182
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,853
 due to the greater proportion  
  of gold in the composition    

183
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:00,292
     and lesser proportion      
 of copper and silver alloys.   

184
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
           narrator:            
    orchids are a standout.     

185
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,608
    their exquisite beauty      

186
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,477
      even caused a frenzy      
    in the mid-19th century     

187
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,947
      when wealthy british      
           collectors           
     hired orchid hunters       

188
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,216
      to search the world       
       for new species.         

189
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:28,419
     today, the fascination     
    with orchids continues,     

190
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,089
      and cultivating them      
    is a growing industry.      

191
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,562
    in thailand, orchids grow   
             wild,              

192
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,564
      but the wild orchids      
       have been tamed.         

193
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,900
          they've been          
  hybridized and domesticated   

194
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:45,571
   to satisfy a global demand   
  for this fantastic flower.    

195
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:51,309
   at this farm, cultivation    
   starts with bud cuttings,    

196
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,646
 mixed with nutrients and water 
       in glass bottle.         

197
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,782
      the bottle provides       
       a germ-free growing      
          environment,          

198
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,718
      keeping the cuttings      
         disease-free           

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,453
     as they grow into baby     
            orchids.            

200
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,123
  this takes a year or more.    

201
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,859
 when the plants have developed 
     a strong root system,      

202
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,895
   they're ready to come out    
        into the world.         

203
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,734
  the worker deposits the baby  
    orchids in a tub of clean   
             water              

204
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,571
 and swishes each one around to 
give their roots a good rinse.  

205
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,479
 she transfers the baby orchids 
     to a perforated plastic    
            basket.             

206
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,352
     a wad of coconut fiber     
        soaked in water         

207
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,887
            provides            
 the next growing environment.  

208
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,759
       the worker places        
 the roots of each baby plant   

209
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,227
      in one of the wads.       

210
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:46,231
  she wraps the fiber snuggly   
       and ties the wad.        

211
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,637
  she places the fiber-wrapped  
   orchids in growing cells.    

212
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,975
 the team waters and fertilizes 
 them for four to six months.   

213
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,446
 the orchids grow to midsize,   

214
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,916
  and the plant's root system   
          flourishes.           

215
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,787
    the plants are now ready    
 for the next phase of growth.  

216
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:13,258
  they transfer the mid-sized   
   orchids to coconut husks.    

217
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:21,867
   the husks act as a kind of   
              plant             
 pot and growing media in one.  

218
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:26,270
  they absorb water to provide  
    a constant supply to the    
            plants.             

219
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,073
 the plants grow on the husks.  

220
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:32,344
      no soil is needed.        

221
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:36,882
  in nature, orchids flourish   
    on tree bark or cracks in   
             rocks,             

222
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,885
       and coconut husks        
   are the next best thing.     

223
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:44,489
 overhead, a nylon-fabric roof  
       diffuses sunlight        

224
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,759
     to simulate conditions     
 found in a shady rainforest.   

225
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,163
       too much light and       
     the heat would harm the    
            plants.             

226
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,370
  gardeners regularly observe   
  the growth of the orchids.    

227
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,840
     they're on the lookout     
for disease or other problems.  

228
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,242
     not all of the plants      
         will thrive.           

229
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,045
          they'll lose          
    about 10% of the crop.      

230
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,649
    they fertilize and water    
          the orchids           

231
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,185
    over a period of several    
            months.             

232
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,522
     many of the plants are     
            hybrids,            

233
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,993
 created by crossing species to 
   achieve a certain color or   
             shape              

234
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,996
    or to improve the plant's   
             vigor.             

235
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,665
   with thousands of species    
     available in nature,       

236
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,334
   the potential combinations   
       are never-ending,        

237
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,372
        and the results         
     are always stunning.       

238
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:40,212
    with the orchids in full    
             bloom,             
  it's time for the harvest.    

239
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,617
    workers cut the orchids     
   at the base of the stems,    

240
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:49,087
   with an eye to making them   
approximately the same length.  

241
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,027
    in the packing room, they   
              tweak             
    the length of the stems     

242
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,430
        until each bunch        
     is perfectly uniform.      

243
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,900
    they make this final cut    
         on an angle.           

244
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,970
 this creates a larger surface  
      for absorbing water       

245
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,240
         so the orchid          
    will stay fresh longer.     

246
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,943
     they sort the flowers      
   by the size of the bloom.    

247
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,649
     they insert the stems      
      in plastic capsules       

248
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:21,052
          that contain          
     a flower-food and water    
            mixture.            

249
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,187
      this should maintain      
    the orchids' freshness      

250
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,056
       during shipping.         

251
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,329
      it's time to wrap up      
    each stunning display.      

252
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:36,268
     the plastic sleeve will    
            preserve            
  them on the journey ahead.    

253
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,541
  this particular orchid is a   
     hybrid species known as    
            mokara.             

254
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,143
     extremely desirable,       

255
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,613
    cut mokara orchids should   
              bloom             
    for up to three weeks.      

256
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,684
    en route to the airport     
in a climate-controlled truck,  

257
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,620
        they'll soon be         
  on an international flight.   

258
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,757
          thai orchids          
  are sold around the world.    

259
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,292
  chances are they'll end up    

260
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,361
  at the center of a big event  
      in someone's life,        

261
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,830
          and whether           
 it's a wedding or a birthday,  

262
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,668
   these stunning orchids will  
               add              
    something special to the    
             party.             

263
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,050
     narrator: the key part     
    of a wheel is its hub,      

264
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,120
   the central point to which   
    all the spokes attach.      

265
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,856
    it's comprised of a body    
   which receives the spokes    

266
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,926
     and houses an axle and     
           bearings.            

267
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,528
     if the wheel has a gear    
            system,             

268
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,996
 then those gears and a clutch  

269
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,065
      are also integrated       
         into the hub.          

270
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,136
        this is the only        
     commercially available     
            unicycle            

271
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,605
    with a gearing system.      

272
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,540
   located on the wheel hub,    

273
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,342
      it enables the rider      
       to push a button         

274
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,144
   to shift from regular gear   
        into high gear          

275
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,346
and reach 25 miles per hour --  

276
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,083
        twice the speed         
    of a regular unicycle.      

277
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,554
 the geared wheel hub contains  
  six identical small gears,    

278
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,423
            rotating            
 around a large central gear.   

279
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,358
        the central one         
    is called the sun wheel     

280
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,028
      and the small ones,       
       planetary gears,         

281
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,564
      because they revolve      
    around the central gear     

282
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,499
        the way planets         
    revolve around the sun.     

283
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:19,504
 each of the small gears begins 
 as a disk-shaped steel blank.  

284
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,773
        a conventional,         
1950s-era gear-cutting machine  

285
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,542
      cuts teeth into it        

286
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,179
 as a shower of oil washes away 
     the shards of metal.       

287
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,982
       the oil also cools       
    and lubricates the tool     

288
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,653
       so that it doesn't       
       overheat or jam.         

289
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,921
     after about 30 seconds     
         of machining,          

290
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,124
          the blank is          
     a fully shaped gear.       

291
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,661
     an even older machine,     
          circa 1930,           

292
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:45,463
      mills a larger blank      
    into the central gear.      

293
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,132
            however,            
 because this gear is bigger,   

294
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,601
   cutting the teeth into it    

295
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:53,138
      takes much longer --      
      about two minutes.        

296
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,607
     once all the gears are     
           machined,            

297
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,676
   they, along with the hub's   
    other steel components,     

298
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:03,614
        undergo a complex       
         heat-treatment         
    process to strengthen the   
             steel.             

299
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,950
   elsewhere in the factory,    

300
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,887
        workers assemble        
 the two halves of the clutch,  

301
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,222
   the component which locks    
   into regular or high gear    

302
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,691
    when the rider shifts.      

303
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,761
    using a cylindrical tool    
       called a broach,         

304
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,898
      the machine grooves       
 in the center of the clutch.   

305
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,134
       slots on the axle        
 will fit into these grooves.   

306
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,375
       next, they unscrew       
 the two halves of the clutch   

307
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,578
  and mount eight hollow pins   
         in each one.           

308
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,649
 in one half, they also install 
  three longer alignment pins   

309
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,586
      and a greased spring      
    inside each hollow pin.     

310
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:45,123
    then they thread the two    
             halves             
 of the clutch onto the axle,   

311
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,859
    aligning the axle slots     
    in the clutch's grooves     

312
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,794
   and the pins on one half     

313
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,998
    with corresponding pins     
    and holes on the other.     

314
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,668
   after fastening the halves   
     together once again,       

315
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,936
           they mount           
    the six planetary gears     

316
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,672
        on a ring called        
      the planet carrier,       

317
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,541
 then install it on the axle.   

318
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,943
     the spring-loaded pins     
         on the clutch          

319
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,813
 click into corresponding slots 
    on the planet carrier.      

320
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,482
   these slots are engineered   
        to fit the pins         

321
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,821
       with no more than        
 .01 millimeters of clearance.  

322
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,223
         after securing         
the planet carrier to the axle  

323
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,558
    with a retaining clip,      

324
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,761
   they insert ball bearings    
         with a spring          

325
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,430
          in two holes          
on opposite sides of the axle.  

326
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:29,700
  a retaining ring holds these  
    spring-loaded bearings in   
             place.             

327
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,904
  meanwhile, a laser engraver   
    etches the company logo     

328
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,640
   and product identification   
    on the wheel-hub body.      

329
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,309
        the body is made        
   of high-strength aluminum    

330
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,445
        that's undergone        
 an electrochemical treatment   

331
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,447
           to make it           
      corrosion-resistant.      

332
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,451
    they mount the hub body     
     on a hydraulic press       

333
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,186
   and insert the sun wheel,    

334
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,722
           surrounded           
   by a large ball bearing.     

335
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,590
 then they activate the press,  

336
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,060
   which forces the sun wheel   
        into the body.          

337
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:57,261
     they install the body      
         on the axle,           

338
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,863
   positioning the sun wheel    

339
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,599
      right in the center       
    of the planetary gears.     

340
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:06,137
   a cover protects the gears   
              from              
dust, dirt, and precipitation.  

341
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,540
   on the opposite end of the   
             body,              

342
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,542
     they install additional    
            bearings            

343
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,745
       and affix a cover        
       with nine screws.        

344
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:16,080
   now the shift buttons --     

345
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,750
      a chrome-plated one       
      for shifting down,        

346
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:21,152
       a gold-plated one        
       for shifting up.         

347
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:25,489
     both screw into a shaft    
             running            
    through the center of the   
             axle.              

348
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,891
the two spring-loaded bearings  

349
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,093
  workers inserted in the axle  
            earlier             

350
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,961
   hold that shaft in place.    

351
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,366
 this cross-section model shows 
how everything comes together.  

352
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,635
        the shift button        
       moves the shaft,         

353
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,505
     which moves the clutch     
    to lock into the selected   
             gear.              

354
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,974
       in regular gear,         

355
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:46,845
 pedaling one revolution makes  
the wheel turn one revolution.  

356
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:49,313
     when the rider shifts      
         to high gear,          

357
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,316
    pedaling one revolution     

358
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,452
      makes the wheel turn      
      1 1/2 revolutions.        

359
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:59,657
 the unicycle moves 50% further 
     as a result of the same    
            action.             

360
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,861
  riders use the regular gear   
         for climbing           

361
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,797
      and the higher gear       
 for flat or downhill terrain.  

362
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,699
   they hit the shift button    

363
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,001
    with their heel or ankle    
       while pedaling --        

364
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:14,773
 a quick, slight movement that  
 won't throw them off balance.  

365
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,419
