     an innerspring mattress    

7
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,123
 is made with steel-wire springs

8
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,059
           to support           
     a person's body weight.    

9
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,394
   the quality of the mattress  
      is usually determined     

10
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,463
        by the thickness

     the number of springs,

    are configured and linked   

13
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,770

         support system.        

14
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,276
    most of this innerspring    
  mattress is crafted by hand.  

15
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:20,746
   the material in between the  
springs contains multiple layers

16

  of batting made from a blend  
       of polyester fiber       

17
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,419
    and organic cotton fiber.   

18
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,355
    cotton allows the batting   
        to be breathable,       

19
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,092
         so the mattress        
      won't trap body heat.     

20
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,695
       polyester prevents       
    the cotton from matting,    

21
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:39,231
         so the batting         
   doesn't flatten over time.   

22
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:43,402
     this machine feeds both    
 materials to a carding machine.

23
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,173
      at the first station,

  next, the blended poly cotton 

26
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,016

          fluffy sheet.

00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,653

        layers the sheet.       

28
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,525
   rollers compress the layers  
     to form a thicker sheet

    about 2 3/4 inches high.    

30
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,797
   the machine cuts the sheet   
     to the width and length    

31
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,133
   of the specified mattress.

   the finished bat on a scale  

33
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,873
        to ensure it hits       
       the target weight.       

34
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,542
   he piles 18 bats on a cart,

 which is how many are required 
     for just one mattress.     

36
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,148
  meanwhile, another technician 

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,550

       support structure,       

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,219
 known as the innerspring unit. 

39
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,024
     a coiling machine pulls    
 spring-steel wire off a spool, 

40
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,160
           then winds           
     and cuts it into coils.    

41
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,962
     the top and the bottom     
    of each coil are crimped,   

42
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,465
creating inter-connection areas.

43
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,770
      a technician inserts      
        spring-steel wire       

44
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:55,174
into a lacing machine and places
   a row of coils on a table.   

45
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,044
    as the machine advances,    
        the helical wire        

46
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,846
 catches the coils at the points
     where they're crimped,     

47
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,449
      lacing them together.     

48
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,252
  the process is repeated until 
      the spring structure      

49
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,921
  is the size of the mattress.  

50

the perimeter of the mattress is
 framed with more helical wire. 

51
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:18,063
 he fabric surface of a mattress
    is known as the ticking.    

52
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,399
       a seamstress marks       
     the required dimensions    

53
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,602
  on a stack of cotton fabric.  

54
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,538
  using a rotary cutting blade, 

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,275
   she cuts the ticking fabric  
  along the marked dimensions.  

56
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:36,082
     a sewer hems the edges     
      of all three panels.      

57
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:39,418
    this step will strengthen   
      the connected seams.      

58
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,421
   he also sews on the labels   
       listing the product      

59
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,690
     and safety information.    

60
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,425
     the side wall consists     
        of four layers --       

61
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,697
 the ticking, two types of bats,
      and a backing fabric.     

62

   through a stamping machine,  

63
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,969

      together with a pair      

64

 batting to prevent indentation.

  the mattress with nine bats,  

76
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:44,016
    equivalent to 27.5 inches   
           of padding.          

77
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,019
   he trims each bat by hand,   

78
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,957
 gradually narrowing the layers 
  as he works his way downward, 

79
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,693
    creating a tapered shape.   

80
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:58,364
  then a polyester fabric layer 
      is added for comfort,     

81
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:02,535
 and a non-woven flame-resistant
  barrier fabric layer on top.

00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,371
           the ticking          
      is put into position,     

83
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,640
     and the excess filling     
           is trimmed.          

84
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,176
      the technician pulls      
     the ticking and pins it    

85
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,445
  to the top of the side wall.  

86

00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,567
  woven cotton ticking is more  
  durable than knitted cotton.

  with a pom-pom on both sides.

    or a plastic receptacle,
