           narrator:            
 today, on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,453
     history suggests slate     
   may have first been mined    

5
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,122
       in the roman era,        

6
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:58,190
      although the earliest     
            confirmed           
     records date back to       

7
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,460
       the early 1700s.         

8
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,797
   slate tiles were used for    
 general building construction  

9
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,499
   and are still used today     

10
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,668
  for practical and aesthetic   
           purposes.            

11
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,474
  these pieces of floor slate   
      appear to be right        

12
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:16,742
       from the quarry,         

13
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,679
        but they're part        
         of an 18-piece puzzle  

14
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,415
    that's cut the same way     
          every time.           

15
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,882
  these pieces of wall slate    

16
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,918
        are much thinner        
  and are used for paneling.    

17
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,957
     uncut sheets of slate      
  in a variety of thicknesses   

18
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,559
come straight from the quarry.  

19
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:40,232
     after the slate sheets     
  are stacked on a forklift,    

20
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,833
       a worker carefully       
          drives them           

21
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,769
        to another part         
     of the storage yard.       

22
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,741
   he sets them down gently.    

23
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,379
    another worker splits the   
             sheets             
           of slate             

24
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,815
  using a pneumatic zip gun.    

25
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,921
   it's a delicate process.     

26
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,189
    once he splits the slate    
            sheets,             

27
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,026
 the worker inspects the lines  
    in the pieces of slate      

28
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,594
     and looks for cracks.      

29
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:15,267
   then, he carries the sheet   
     to a gauging machine.      

30
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,136
    he checks the thickness     
         of the sheet           

31
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,039
   to make sure it won't cause  
              jams              
     on the cutting table.      

32
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,480
 this multiblade cutting table  
    slices a sheet of slate     

33
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,348
   into a series of strips.     

34
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,821
          it's covered          
     with recycled water.       

35
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,823
        this lubricates         
     the cutting process,       

36
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,825
        cools the slate         
      and cutting blades,       

37
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,895
   and removes unwanted dust    
        and particles.          

38
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,364
    a conveyor slowly moves     
   the slate sheet forward.     

39
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,103
 a total of 18 diamond blades   

40
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,739
    slice the sheet of slate    
         into strips.           

41
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,712
     these strips of slate      
      will be used for wall     
           paneling.            

42
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,118
       this cutting table       
    can cut several sheets of   
             slate              

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,486
       at the same time.        

44
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:13,391
    once the cutting process    
         is complete,           

45
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,328
  a worker inspects the strips  
      of slate and sorts        

46
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,732
  them according to thickness   
          and width.            

47
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,903
  next, he piles some of them   
 in preparation for splitting.  

48
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:29,141
    he cracks thicker strips    
     of slate using a stone     
            splitter            

49
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,876
 with a hardened steel blade.   

50
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,413
         he makes sure          
      they're thin enough       

51
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,816
 to be used for wall paneling.  

52
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:43,288
    once the pieces of slate    
 reach their final thickness,   

53
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,126
 a worker places them in boxes, 
    ready for installation.     

54
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,097
   a worker inspects a sheet    
           of slate             

55
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,233
      that will be used for     
           flooring.            

56
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,902
     the thickness of slate     
            flooring            
       must be constant.        

57
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,375
     he places a sheet on a     
           conveyor.            

58
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,111
       it takes the slate       
  through a gauging machine,    

59
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,980
       where its surface        
 will be made perfectly even.   

60
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,720
   using two diamond grinding   
  wheels, the gauging machine   

61
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:19,492
 shaves off any pieces of stone 
      that exceed a preset      
           thickness.           

62
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,863
     after several minutes      
          of shaving,           

63
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,800
    the slate sheet emerges     
   from the gauging machine.    

64
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:31,804
  an employee checks the sheet  
   to make sure it's smooth.    

65
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:36,875
 first, he checks the underside 
 of the eventual floor tiles.   

66
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,944
 then, he checks the top side,  

67
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,946
         the stone face         
    that will be displayed.     

68
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,019
 the worker places the smooth,  
      flat piece of slate       

69
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,620
      on a cutting frame.       

70
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,355
    the computerized cutting    
            machine             

71
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:54,960
    cuts 18 pieces of slate     
according to a preset pattern.  

72
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,164
   a high-velocity water jet    
 cuts the stone at three times  

73
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,565
      the speed of sound.       

74
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,370
       the water is pure,       
    filtered several times.     

75
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,039
    the first time the slabs    
   move through the machine,    

76
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,375
    it cuts pieces 1 to 9,      

77
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,243
 and the second time through,   

78
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,212
   it cuts pieces 10 to 18.     

79
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,118
   the worker snaps off excess  
              trim              
          and stacks            

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,390
    the cut pieces of slate     
  according to their numbers.   

81
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,392
      all the number ones       
 are identical to each other,   

82
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,296
    as are each of the other    
             numbers            
   in the 18-piece pattern.     

83
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,802
     repeated on a floor,       

84
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:40,071
      the 18-piece pattern      
       appears natural.         

85
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,742
 this nonporous slate comes in  
different textures and colors,  

86
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,712
      and can also be used      
   in bathrooms or roofing.     

87
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,031
           narrator:            
    the first hot dog carts     

88
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,567
   were rolled out in new york  
              city              
   in the mid-19th century.     

89
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,906
  they were simple push carts   
  with small charcoal stoves    

90
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,975
 and served sausages on buns.   

91
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,712
 those sandwiches became known  
         as hot dogs.           

92
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,720
     a modern hot dog cart      
    is a kitchen on wheels.     

93
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,990
   equipped with a water tank   
           and sink,            

94
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,457
     a steamer and grill,       

95
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,060
         and a cooler,          
it's made to serve the public.  

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,333
 and they're sometimes designed 
   to stand out in a crowd.     

97
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,470
  to make this hot dog cart,    

98
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,440
     they start with molds      
 for the hot dog-shaped body.   

99
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,948
  a worker brushes a nonstick   
 coating into the first mold.   

100
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,751
   it will allow the completed  
              part              
     to be easily removed.      

101
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,493
 he places fiberglass one sheet 
     at time in the mold.       

102
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:12,097
  he brushes a generous amount  
    of epoxy resin onto each    
             piece.             

103
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,500
     the fiberglass starts      
   to solidify very quickly,    

104
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,570
    but he leaves it to set     
overnight for a complete cure.  

105
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,179
  they assemble the two halves  
  of the hot dog-shaped body    

106
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,916
    and apply bonding to the    
             seams.             

107
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,052
      a colorful paint job      
      completes the look.       

108
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,123
   next, computerized tools     

109
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,193
      cut holes in a sheet      
     of food-grade steel.       

110
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,063
  these holes will accommodate  
      the sink, faucets,        

111
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,099
       and other parts.         

112
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,601
     then, the cooler door      
         takes shape.           

113
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,869
        using a press,          

114
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,272
  the worker bends up the edge  
      of a piece of steel       

115
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,873
   that's been cut to size.     

116
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,612
     he transfers the part      
    to another break press.     

117
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,149
   this one is computerized.    

118
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,753
 it folds back the bend to give 
    the door a strong, smooth   
             edge.              

119
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:13,092
    he repeats this process     
      on two other sides.       

120
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:18,630
  he then clamps a continuous   
   hinge to the only unfolded   
             edge,              

121
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,699
          and he welds          
  and rivets the hinge to it.   

122
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:31,376
 work now begins on the chassis 
     of the hot dog cart.       

123
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,445
    a worker welds heavy wall   
             steel              

124
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,814
        tubing to create        
      a rugged framework.       

125
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,384
      after painting it,        

126
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,054
    he bolts the wheel axle     
   to brackets on the sides.    

127
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,530
     he tightens the bolts      

128
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,033
       to an exact torque       
   using a pneumatic wrench.    

129
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,370
      he screws taillights      
        to the bumper.          

130
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,807
  the lights are surrounded by  
metal brackets to protect them  

131
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,011
       from being damaged       
 by customers waiting in line.  

132
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,514
       the brackets also        
  serve as a mounting plate.    

133
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,953
     the team now transfers     
   the fiberglass cart body     

134
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,121
        to the chassis.         

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,759
    they drill large holes      

136
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,229
       to vent gas fumes        
    and smaller screw holes     

137
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,764
       to secure the body       
        to the chassis.         

138
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,042
    they line the cart with a   
             molded             
fiberglass and styrofoam unit.  

139
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,379
    it has compartments for     
     the water tank and food    
            cooler,             

140
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,981
       and it also serves       
    as an insulating layer.     

141
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,853
  they install the steel food   
     preparation surface,       

142
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,322
    which has been equipped     
   with a sink and faucets.     

143
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:57,196
 a member of the team tightens  
 a crimp ring around the hoses  

144
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:01,066
        to supply water         
     to the sink faucets.       

145
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,336
       he runs a gas line       
   to the steamer's burners     

146
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,438
     and lowers the steamer     
    into place on the cart.     

147
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,079
    he assembles a barbecue     
to the other side of the cart,  

148
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,214
    and this gives customers    
       a grilled option         

149
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,216
      for their hot dogs.       

150
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,456
   they hinge the cooler door   
   to the front of the cart.    

151
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,964
     once closed, the door      
  seals the insulated chamber   

152
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,235
  to keep hot dogs, sausages,   
       and sodas on ice.        

153
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,976
the team presses bold graphics  

154
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,479
    to the fiberglass shell     
and peels off the paper liner.  

155
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:53,752
   and with that, this hot dog  
              cart              
  is ready to hit the street,   

156
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,589
    just in time for lunch.     

157
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,674
 narrator: decades ago, people  
   had to get out of the car    

158
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,413
  when arriving home in order   
   to open the garage door.     

159
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,616
  today, it's routine to open   
  and close your garage door    

160
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,419
   at the push of a button,     

161
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:31,356
  either on a wall-mounted pad  
    or on a remote control.     

162
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:37,496
  a garage door opener's motor  
drives either a belt, a chain,  

163
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,965
        or a screw rod,         
      like these models.        

164
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:44,369
 in turn, they move a carriage  
 connected to the garage door.  

165
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,903
       at this factory,         

166
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,174
   the production line starts   
  and ends at the same place.   

167
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,311
 they take one completed garage 
   door opener off the line,    

168
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,911
     then start a new one       

169
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:59,150
   by attaching a power cord    
 to the unit's steel chassis.   

170
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,318
 then, they place the chassis   

171
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,387
   onto a traveling assembly    
            fixture             

172
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,855
  and plug in the power cord    

173
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,091
        to prep the unit        
      for testing later.        

174
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:12,931
 they place the unit's plastic  
 housing next to the chassis,   

175
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,667
           then snap            
 in the plastic safety cover.   

176
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,936
   this goes over the direct    
        current motor,          

177
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,939
         the equivalent         
     of 1 1/4 horsepower.       

178
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,009
 they attach an optical encoder 
         to the motor.          

179
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,546
    the encoder is a sensor     
     which reads the door's     
            position            

180
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,450
  so that the motor knows when  
 to stop moving the carriage.   

181
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,221
      they place the motor      
   against the safety cover,    

182
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,689
    then screw it in place.     

183
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,029
        in the housing,         
     they install the motion    
            sensor.             

184
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,764
it turns on the opener's light  

185
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,965
            as soon             
  as you walk into the garage   

186
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,701
or when the garage door opens.  

187
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,441
   next are the switches for    
programming the remote control  

188
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,443
        and for setting         
      the travel limits.        

189
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,045
 these are the points to which  

190
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:04,783
 the opener must move the door  
  to fully open and close it.   

191
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,053
 they then install the circuit  
  board, routing the antenna    

192
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,723
     for the remote control     
            receiver            
        to the outside.         

193
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,525
    they plug in the motion     
         sensor cable,          

194
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,529
   then wire and plug in the    
 connector for the light bulbs  

195
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,800
 and fasten the board in place  
         with screws.           

196
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,804
   they attach the electrical   
  ground wire to the chassis,   

197
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,272
   connect the power cable,     

198
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,275
 and then, the optical encoder  
     to the circuit board.      

199
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,547
      with all the internal     
           components           
        installed now,          

200
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,216
     they affix the housing     
        to the chassis.         

201
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,819
    this completes the brain    
  of the garage door opener,    

202
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,187
   called the operator unit.    

203
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,827
  an automated testing machine  
 now checks all the functions,  

204
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,563
      simulating the load       
      of the garage door.       

205
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:55,033
 it also checks the light bulb  
   sockets and the connection   
             ports              

206
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:59,103
      on the circuit board      
     for the safety beams.      

207
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,773
         the beams stop         
 and reverse the closing door   

208
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:05,310
   if they detect any object    
         in its path.           

209
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:10,048
     once the operator unit     
        passes inspect,         

210
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,352
   it comes full circle to the  
              end,              
   which is also the start,     

211
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,420
    of the production line.     

212
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,458
         a plastic lens         
  to enclose the light bulbs,   

213
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,061
   and the unit comes off the   
             line.              

214
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,937
       the carriage rail        
    is milled from galvanized   
             steel.             

215
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,872
          it has slots          
 for locking in plastic liners  

216
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,409
   which hold the screw rod.    

217
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,218
   to produce the screw rod,    

218
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,020
      the factory machines      
     a solid bar of steel       

219
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,556
   to the required dimensions   
         and profile.           

220
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,627
    then, with high-pressure    
  rollers, it forms threads in  
              it.               

221
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:59,764
  workers insert the screw rod  
 into the liners in the rail.   

222
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,032
    for the retail market,      

223
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,902
      rather than produce       
 one long rail and screw rod,   

224
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,970
          the factory           
makes three shorter connecting  

225
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,641
       sections that fit        
    into a smaller package.     

226
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,844
    this machine lubricates     
  the screw rod with grease.    

227
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,580
  it helps it rotate smoothly   
       in the rail liner        

228
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,050
    when the opener's motor     
          is running.           

229
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,718
   when the screw rod turns,    

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,988
       teeth on the base        
   of the carriage interlock    

231
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,189
       with the threads,        

232
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,458
      moving the carriage       
        along the rail.         

233
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,996
   workers first install the    
 carriage base at the factory.  

234
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,464
        then, they pack         

235
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,332
   all the garage door opener   
   components for shipping,     

236
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,802
     starting with the rail     
            sections            
    and the operator unit.      

237
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,677
       last to go in are        
 the wall-mounted control pad,  

238
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,746
      the remote controls,      
     and the safety beams,      

239
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:53,084
 which you install on each side 
  of the garage door opening.   

240
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,420
        when you install        
    the garage door opener,     

241
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,556
    you insert the screw rod    
 into the motor's drive shaft.  

242
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,892
  then, you assemble the rest   
       of the carriage,         

243
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,227
    connecting it to an arm     

244
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,629
         which attaches         
      to the garage door.       

245
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,834
          motor runs,           
    screw rod turns, carriage   
             moves,             

246
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,269
      and your garage door      
       opens or closes.         

247
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,317
     narrator: the bicycle      

248
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,787
   is the most efficient mode   
  of transport ever invented.   

249
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,388
      ninety-nine percent       
         of the effort          

250
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,658
    put into turning a pedal    
  is transferred to movement,   

251
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,127
    so the lighter the bike,    
          the better.           

252
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,929
 using cutting-edge materials,  

253
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,266
  a high-performance seat can   
     weigh as little as five    
            ounces.             

254
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,404
   this company made a special  
              seat              

255
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,006
   for a past tour de france    
            winner.             

256
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,611
 in fact, half the cyclists on  
    the prestigious pro tour    
             racing             

257
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:54,812
   circuit use their seats.     

258
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,949
 the design process begins with 
     the simplest tools --      

259
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,818
      pencils and paper.        

260
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,954
        designers sketch        
    out a few basic ideas.      

261
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,757
   specialists then transform   
      the sketched ideas        

262
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,892
   into 3-d digital images.     

263
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:12,364
        the manufacturers       
          machine-model         
those images into a prototype.  

264
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,568
      after testing, they       
     begin the manufacturing    
            process.            

265
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,036
    a worker places a base,     

266
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,305
           or shell,            
    on the upper segment of a   
             mold.              

267
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,108
    this company makes their    
             shells             

268
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,410
         from a variety         
  of carbon fiber materials.    

269
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,048
    polyurethane pours into     
the other section of the mold.  

270
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,517
 this is the part of the mold   

271
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,652
    that will give the seat     
          its shape.            

272
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,454
     when the mold closes,      

273
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,657
 it cooks at a mere 104 degrees 
          fahrenheit.           

274
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,594
    a chemical reaction takes   
              place             
       inside the mold,         

275
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:46,464
 which causes the polyurethane  
          to expand.            

276
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,732
      five minutes later,       

277
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,469
 an operator removes the seats  
        from the molds.         

278
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:56,474
  here, we see what the shells  
  look like before and after.   

279
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,678
    a worker removes excess     
  polyurethane from the edges   

280
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,479
         with a knife.          

281
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,815
 while the polyurethane cures,  

282
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,750
            workers             
  prepare the cover material.   

283
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,353
        the material is         
   a proprietary microfiber     

284
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,821
     specially made for this    
            company.            

285
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,025
   not only does this material  
              need              
  to be flexible, waterproof,   

286
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,226
       and comfortable,         

287
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,562
     it has to be incredibly    
            durable.            

288
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,132
 once they've cut the material  
         into strips,           

289
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,835
          the workers           
    stack them on a stamping    
             press.             

290
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,839
   a die has been custom made   
   to match the design of the   
             seat.              

291
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,509
       the stamping press       
  descends with enough force    

292
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:35,112
     to cut through multiple    
            layers.             

293
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,383
     it's now time to join      
 the three panels of material   

294
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,185
 that make up the seat cover.   

295
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,721
         this facility          
   has two different methods    

296
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,323
    for attaching the pieces    
        to each other.          

297
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,058
         in this case,          

298
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,361
   a skilled worker carefully   
      stitches the material     
           together.            

299
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,466
       a different method       
     of joining the panels      

300
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:58,335
       involves a process       
    called thermal welding.     

301
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,471
 an operator skives, or thins,  

302
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,742
   the edges by shaving them    
 so that there won't be a bump  

303
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:06,544
      where they overlap.       

304
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,948
       double-sided tape        
     will hold the material     
           together.            

305
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,219
    a special tape dispenser    
             applies            
 the tape to the skived edges.  

306
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:20,891
 a worker positions the panels, 
    carefully overlapping the   
             edges.             

307
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,493
  a vacuum system removes air   

308
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,897
    from between the top and    
             bottom             
    sections of the press,      

309
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,231
holding the panels in position  

310
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,168
   and ensuring there will be   
   no bubbles at the seams.     

311
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,371
         the press then         
      heats the material        

312
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,840
 up to 280 degrees fahrenheit,  

313
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,778
   ensuring that the adhesive   
              bonds             
     the panels together.       

314
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,781
           the design           
  of the shell for this seat    

315
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,382
    has several slots in it     

316
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,984
         to help create         
     the right combination      

317
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,652
 of flexibility and rigidity.   

318
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,254
        a laser machine         

319
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,724
    cuts stripes in the cover   
             fabric             
  to create a graphic element   

320
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,393
   that reflects this design    
           feature.             

321
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,331
  workers glue silver material  
       under the stripes        

322
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,599
      to highlight them,        

323
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,670
    then brush glue all over    
  the underside of the cover.   

324
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:09,206
 mounting the cover on the seat 
    requires two operators.     

325
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,343
 they place the cover glue side 
       down on the seat,        

326
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,746
            ensuring            
that it's positioned perfectly  

327
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,247
     and that there are no      
         air pockets.           

328
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,086
      they work the cover       
      into a small recess       

329
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,955
 that runs around the perimeter 
         of the base.           

330
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,590
    they will then trim off     
      the excess material       

331
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,159
     with a utility knife.      

332
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,562
           the amount           
        of skilled manual       
         craftsmanship          

333
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,563
 required to build these seats  

334
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,299
        is a key feature        
       of their quality,        

335
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:39,570
  but the company also relies   
       on state-of-the-art      
          technology.           

336
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,575
     bicycle seats sit on a     
            framework           
        called a rail.          

337
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,244
   this facility makes rails    
    from both carbon fiber      

338
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,246
       and metal alloys,        

339
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,381
     and it tests each one      
      with a dynamometer.       

340
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,851
       workers put glue         

341
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,521
    in the attachment points    
   on the bottom of the seat    

342
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:00,525
       to ensure that it        
    passes a stringent safety   
             test.              

343
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:04,929
   a customized machine bends   
the seat to fit into the rail.  

344
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,132
   the seat will then be bent   
              back              
    in the other direction      

345
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,202
          to return it          
    to its original shape.      

346
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,804
   the seat is now finished.    

347
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,940
             fusing
