narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,092
nails and staples --

5
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,962
a fascinating
manufacturing process.

6
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,964
safety glasses --

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,634
focused on protecting
your eyesight.

8
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,170
fabrics --

9
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:43,574
we'll weave our way
through a textile mill.

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,976
and bicycles --

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,246
we gear up
to see how they're made.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,654
if you've ever needed
to attach two pieces of wood,

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,323
you know there's no shortage
of fasteners.

14
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,927
you can choose from
common nails, spiral nails,

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,596
finishing nails,
and even staples.

16
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,064
and if you've ever wondered

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,467
where these
useful little items come from,

18
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,637
well, we've got it all
nailed down for you.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,944
there are hundreds of varieties
of nails being made,

20
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,147
and they're made
of very durable carbon steel,

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,483
all starting from steel wire.

22
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,485
rolled up on a drum,

23
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:32,756
this steel wire weighs in
at 5,500 pounds.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,359
the wire's diameter
is a quarter of an inch.

25
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,694
and that's too large,

26
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:40,164
so they'll have to reduce
its size.

27
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,899
using many drums,

28
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,301
they're going to pull the wire
successively

29
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,770
to gradually thin it.

30
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,872
then they'll roll it up again.

31
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,316
when full,
this roll will contain

32
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,121
almost 80,000 feet of wire
weighing 2,500 pounds.

33
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:08,592
the wire now has a diameter
of 1/10 of an inch,

34
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,196
so it will have to be reduced
by half.

35
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,800
now they're going to cut
the wire into little rods.

36
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,604
the cut rods are gathered up
with this electromagnet

37
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,975
and dumped into a machine
that will process them.

38
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,884
here, the rods
are made into nails.

39
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,153
the metal rods
move along slowly,

40
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,422
and a blade
forms the nail points.

41
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,159
these blades are changed
every 600 hours.

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,635
this machine forms nailheads

43
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,606
by flattening them with great
pressure on the rod ends.

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,780
nailheads are formed
at a rate of 1,400 per minute.

45
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,389
the manufacturing of nails
is now finished.

46
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,861
they fall into a chute,
then into this collecting bin.

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,263
nails are sold by the pound

48
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,500
or embedded in plastic rolls,
as we see here.

49
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:30,274
this machine inserts 167 nails
into each roll.

50
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:34,312
the plastic strip has teeth,
and the nails hook into these.

51
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,151
they handle the rolls
with gloves,

52
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,789
since the coating applied
to the nails is not yet dry.

53
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,762
this machine produces
five rolls a minute

54
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,031
for a total of 835 nails.

55
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,571
making spiral nails requires
an extra processing step.

56
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,307
this machine puts the spirals
into the nails

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,442
with these cylinders
and welds them.

58
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,678
it makes 1,200 nails a minute.

59
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,449
then the nails
are put together into strips

60
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,052
for use
in pneumatic nailing guns.

61
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,022
each strip contains
30 spiral nails.

62
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,462
to help them in place,
the nails are coated

63
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,265
with a resin
that dries in four minutes.

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,337
this is the nailing device
that uses nails on a strip.

65
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,808
it sets the nails in one strike
with the user's trigger finger.

66
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,418
now we move on
to the fabrication of staples.

67
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,087
the staple press binds
80 iron wires,

68
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,890
which have been well-lined up.

69
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:58,062
the 80 small wires
are placed side by side.

70
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,968
the wires are glued together.

71
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,975
then the wires come out
well-adhered to one another.

72
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,380
the staple strips
are fed into this machine.

73
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,785
it cuts the staples
to the desired length

74
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,321
and folds them
in one stroke of this press,

75
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,790
which applies 40 tons
of pressure.

76
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,059
staples are formed
on this gauge,

77
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,662
and the staple strips
are then ready for packaging.

78
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,666
every day they produce a total
of some 25 million nails here,

79
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,401
which require the processing

80
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:41,038
of 11,000 tons of metal
annually.

81
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,815
narrator:
at work and at play,

82
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,617
our precious vision
can be at risk.

83
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,620
for instance,
we need to protect our eyes

84
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,024
when we're using power tools
and when we're playing squash.

85
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,561
thankfully, all we need to do
is wear safety glasses.

86
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,296
how do they make them
so resistant?

87
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,165
let's have a look.

88
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,773
many sports and trades require
the wearing of safety glasses.

89
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,310
these glasses are made
with plastic molding.

90
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,978
here we see the interior
of a mold.

91
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,449
the optical part of the lens
is mirrored

92
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:29,954
in order to be as transparent as
possible without being deformed.

93
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,995
the glasses are made by melting
the primary material,

94
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,332
a plastic resin
called polycarbonate.

95
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,204
the resin granules
are poured into this machine.

96
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,208
it becomes liquefied
at a temperature of 450 degrees.

97
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,012
the liquid plastic is injected
into the mold under pressure

98
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,415
over a 30- to 60-second period.

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,751
the plastic hardens rapidly,

100
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,555
and the glasses are then
removed from the mold.

101
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,224
they mold several glasses
at a time.

102
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,093
the glasses are separated
by hand

103
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,997
and then are given
an initial visual inspection.

104
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,574
the glasses are placed
on this support.

105
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,309
they're then taken
to the laboratory,

106
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,778
where they'll be given
a surface treatment.

107
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,315
but before beginning
the treatment,

108
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,517
they're washed
to eliminate any impurities

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,719
and to assure
that the coating treatment

110
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,621
adheres well to the lens.

111
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,462
when they've been washed,

112
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,264
the glasses are then rinsed
in clear water.

113
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,807
the glasses are now gently
soaked in a chemical solution,

114
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,211
which prevents misting
and scratching of the lens.

115
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,821
this coating
now has to be cooked.

116
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,823
they direct the glasses
toward an oven

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,893
heated to 480 degrees.

118
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,094
the soaking and cooking
processes

119
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,465
vary between 30 minutes
and 2 hours.

120
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,969
each pair of glasses
is inspected to make sure

121
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,374
there are no imperfections
or distortions in the lenses.

122
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,546
then the glasses are placed
on this support.

123
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,787
this milling machine
automatically removes

124
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,257
the last piece of polycarbonate.

125
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,857
this one was left in place

126
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,126
so that they would be able
to handle the glasses

127
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,329
without having to touch
the lenses.

128
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,801
at this stage of the production
of the glasses,

129
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,738
the nosepiece is glued on.

130
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,347
certain pairs of glasses
are selected

131
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,082
from each production run.

132
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,885
here they evaluate
the resistance of glasses

133
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,223
to a racquetball hurled at them
at 90 miles per hour.

134
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,427
here a hockey visor is tested

135
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,098
against a puck traveling
at 60 miles an hour.

136
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,233
to conform to safety standards,

137
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,435
the glasses must withstand
these tests.

138
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,439
it confirms
that they're truly safe.

139
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,443
they now proceed
to final assembly steps

140
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,046
in making the glasses.

141
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,981
the last few pieces
of the glasses,

142
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,917
such as the plastic ear stems,
are installed.

143
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:57,261
now completed,
the glasses are placed in cases.

144
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,164
it's the final step
in their fabrication.

145
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,402
they make several types
of safety glasses here --

146
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,939
industrial,
hockey and football visors,

147
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,110
swimming goggles,
and racquetball glasses.

148
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,823
this facility turns out

149
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,294
thousands of safety glasses
every day,

150
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,764
and the polycarbonate resin used
to make those safety glasses

151
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,001
could very well save your eyes
one day.

152
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,443
narrator:
early man relied on animal skins

153
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,979
to protect himself
against the elements.

154
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,248
eventually,
fabrics were invented,

155
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,851
giving us a bit more choice
in the matter

156
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,187
and eliminating the need to hunt
or go naked.

157
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,057
today textile mills make fabrics

158
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,560
in every conceivable pattern
and color.

159
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,667
fabric is made from thousands
of braided threads.

160
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,737
this mill has 700 bobbins
of polyester.

161
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,674
each bobbin contains
155 miles of thread.

162
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,678
we begin by separating
the threads.

163
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,947
this warp unit takes the 700
strands and assembles them.

164
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,684
then this comb separates them.

165
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,755
other strands are added,

166
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,758
and in total there will be
7,000 of them.

167
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,163
one fabric is composed of
threads braided at 90 degrees.

168
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,632
the warp threads
are assembled lengthwise,

169
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,836
while the weft threads
are joined transversely.

170
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,471
to prevent the threads
from tearing,

171
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,373
they pass through a bin of glue.

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,842
these rollers eliminate
the surplus.

173
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:57,314
the glue will be removed with
water before dyeing the threads.

174
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,651
the glued-together threads
exit this machine.

175
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,055
these large green cylinders
are heated

176
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,425
and dry the glue on the threads.

177
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,197
knitting will soon begin.

178
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,401
the 700 strands are newly
separated on this loom roller.

179
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,809
each thread must pass through
a blade

180
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,145
to produce a specific design.

181
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:32,549
this machine takes the 7,000
strands of thread, one by one,

182
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,751
and they pass through the blade.

183
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,987
it's a highly precise operation.

184
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,567
the threads pass through
a blade,

185
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,836
and the weaving finally begins.

186
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,172
on this jacquard-type
loom roller,

187
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:59,109
the warped thread is inserted
by a jet of air.

188
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,913
the weaving machine
assembles two loom rollers

189
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,115
made of 7,000 strands.

190
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,519
the fabric reaches a width
of 12 feet.

191
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,321
the dark threads are inserted
into the weave.

192
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:15,325
they insert 600 weft strands
per minute.

193
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,794
the blades remove
the weft strands

194
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,797
to insert the warp ones
between the two.

195
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,633
a comb pushes the weft.

196
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,604
the plate of the breakage chain
stops the machine

197
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,607
if a thread should break.

198
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,812
this bobbin contains
155 miles of thread.

199
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:44,087
the weft thread
is in the insertion nozzle.

200
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,025
when a weft is inserted,
an air jet nudges it in.

201
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,962
the loom roller operates
at full tilt.

202
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,767
it makes 600
thread intersections a minute.

203
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,171
weaving is now over.

204
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,309
we move on to the following
steps -- washing and dyeing.

205
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:10,980
washing is done in
a soapy solution at 175 degrees

206
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,717
and at a speed of 195 feet
of fabric a minute.

207
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,055
the fabric is rinsed in
clear water of about 85 degrees.

208
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,257
now it's on to dyeing.

209
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,793
this is done with jets.

210
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:26,663
up to 7 1/2 miles of fabric
is placed in clean water

211
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,665
into which colorants
have been added.

212
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,199
the solution is heated,

213
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,869
and the fabric soaks here
for about six hours.

214
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,006
then it will be rinsed
in lukewarm water.

215
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,545
the fabric is placed in a bin.

216
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,687
this machine is called
an opener.

217
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,089
it unfolds and stretches
the material

218
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,993
before rolling it up
on an immense roller.

219
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,171
and now the roll is almost full.

220
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,379
we now move to thermosetting
in a high-temperature oven

221
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,847
that dries the fabric.

222
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,249
the temperature
is almost 400 degrees

223
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,584
at the oven's entrance.

224
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,187
the fabric circulates here
for 45 seconds.

225
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,189
the bobbin that we saw
at the beginning

226
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,926
has produced 15 miles of fabric.

227
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,429
this finished roll
weighs 3,300 pounds.

228
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,471
narrator:
bicycles have come a long way

229
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,541
from the original basic design.

230
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,743
now they feature multiple gears,

231
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,479
high-tech materials
like carbon-fiber frames

232
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,149
and featherlight metal alloys.

233
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,284
and they're made
to tackle everything

234
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,956
from quiet bike paths to
the most rugged mountain trails.

235
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,230
a french invention of 1790,

236
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,567
the first bicycle resembled
a 2-wheeled wooden horse

237
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,835
without pedals or handlebars.

238
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,506
in 1817, a german gave it
direction control.

239
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,642
the addition of pedals
to the front wheels

240
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,843
came from france in 1861.

241
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,578
the british contributed as well,

242
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,249
adding the large front wheel
in 1870.

243
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:30,120
by 1903,
all countries participated

244
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,522
in the first
bicycle tour de france.

245
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:46,202
a bicycle is a beautiful piece
of engineering.

246
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,071
the frames are made of steel

247
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,541
or a chromium-molybdenum alloy
known as chromoly.

248
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,277
fabrication begins
with these hollow tubes.

249
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,081
the tube cutter cuts the steel
before sending it to the bender.

250
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,417
the bender curves the tubes
cold,

251
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,620
exerting strong pressure
against the bending jig.

252
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,429
the tubes must now be
machined --

253
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,765
that is, cut into lengths

254
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,367
so that they correctly fit
into one another.

255
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,638
during this operation,
cutting oil cools the tube.

256
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,242
the tube is cut,
taking into consideration

257
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,712
the insertion angle
of the other pieces.

258
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,249
tubes to be welded together
are placed in this support.

259
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,190
they insert a piece in an alloy
of silver and bronze,

260
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,925
which increases the strength

261
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:45,128
and produces a better finish
at the welding point.

262
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,333
welding now takes place.

263
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,136
welding of the frame
requires about two minutes

264
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,573
at a temperature
of over 1,400 degrees.

265
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,612
once welded, the part
takes four minutes to cool.

266
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,415
they proceed in the same way
with all the tubes

267
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,617
that form the frame
of the bicycle.

268
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:14,157
at this stage, it's important
to straighten the frame,

269
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,560
which could have deformed
during welding.

270
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,362
they verify the alignment
of the tubes

271
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,864
and straighten it out cold

272
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,800
with a tool that sets it
to the right dimensions.

273
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,774
now they're going to paint
the frames.

274
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,709
paint is applied
with a spray gun

275
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,712
and adheres to the frame
by static contact.

276
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,647
then the paint will be baked

277
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,285
in a natural-gas oven
at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.

278
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:49,526
the frame is now cooled,
and we can begin the assembly.

279
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,633
the labels are now applied.

280
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,071
in another department,

281
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,274
an employee assembles
the handlebars.

282
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,911
he installs the mechanism
for the brakes and the gears.

283
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,885
now we move on
to the wheel rims.

284
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,622
the 36 stainless-steel spokes
of each aluminum wheel

285
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,625
are installed manually.

286
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:25,295
the dexterity of these workers
allows them to install spokes

287
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,898
on 65 wheel rims in an hour.

288
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:34,271
this spoke tool allows them to
screw the spokes into the rim.

289
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,780
this machine exerts a pressure
on the spokes

290
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,249
so that they'll have
the desired tension.

291
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,718
if there's too much
or not enough tension,

292
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,787
the rim will be crooked.

293
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,595
this machine aligns the rims,

294
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,264
essential for proper functioning
of the bicycle.

295
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,400
it automatically adjusts
the spokes

296
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,869
so that the wheel
will be truly straight.

297
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,405
next step --

298
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,908
placing of the tubes
and the tires on the wheel rims.

299
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,415
set upside down,

300
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,751
the bicycle circulates
from one workshop to another,

301
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,621
where they will install
the last mechanical parts.

302
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,624
these accessories
are not made here.

303
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,160
the handlebars, the pedals,
the fork, the brake,

304
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,831
and chain mechanisms
are all installed manually.

305
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,738
here they screw on
the rear brake plate.

306
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,841
finally they inspect
each bicycle

307
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,109
to make sure that the bolts
are well-tightened

308
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,579
and that everything's
working properly.

309
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,581
then it's on to packaging.

310
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,985
this factory makes
2,500 bicycles each day.

311
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,953
assembled from various tubes
of chromoly,

312
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,723
each one weighs about 25 pounds

313
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,994
and will run
for thousands of miles.

314
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,271
if you have any comments
