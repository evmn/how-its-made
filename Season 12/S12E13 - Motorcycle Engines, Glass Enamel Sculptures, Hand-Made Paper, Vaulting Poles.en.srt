00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,653
           narrator:            
 the v-twin motorcycle engine   

4
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,789
      actually dates back       
     more than a century.       

5
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,991
   talk about staying power.    

6
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,493
     central to the design      
       are two cylinders        

7
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,062
        that form a "v"         
    around the crankshaft.      

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,265
       this configuration       
        is more compact         

9
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:10,570
  than a straight-line engine,  
  and its appeal is timeless.   

10
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,542
  with its throttle cranked,    

11
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,412
    the v-twin can take you     
      on an exciting ride       

12
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,348
 and leave sedans in its dust.  

13
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,420
          to make one,          
   a robot loads a cylinder     

14
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:30,556
         into a machine         
 equipped with cutting tools.   

15
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:34,493
 the tools mill the cylinder's  
metal slats to highlight them.  

16
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,628
           the slats            
   are called cooling fins.     

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,699
  they allow the engine's heat  
         to dissipate.          

18
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,970
    this cutting tool bores     
     into the center of the     
           cylinder,            

19
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,972
      carving it to precise     
           dimensions           

20
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,775
   to allow engine components   
        a perfect fit.          

21
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:54,246
       next, an operator        
   assembles the crankshaft.    

22
00:01:54,248 --> 00:02:00,052
   he aligns connecting rods    
and slides them over bearings.  

23
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:04,190
   he then assembles the rods   
       and bearings to the      
          crankshaft.           

24
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,696
           a machine            
      press-fits everything     
           together.            

25
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,670
     next, a lift scoops up     
    the crankshaft assembly     

26
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:21,307
      and transfers it to       
      the lower half of the     
           crankcase.           

27
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,815
     at the next station,       

28
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,551
     an automated dispenser     
   precisely applies sealant    

29
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,187
       to the inner edge        
       of the crankcase.        

30
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,492
       they then arrange        
      the upper half of the     
           crankcase            

31
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,827
     on the lower assembly      

32
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,929
  and bolt the two together.    

33
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,636
     it's now time to link      
     the crankcase and shaft    
            assembly            

34
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,773
     to the transmission.       

35
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,079
    this chrome-plated cover    
    is the finishing touch.     

36
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,653
  next, they fit the camshaft   
      into the crankcase.       

37
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,690
            its job             
 is to maintain valve timing.   

38
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,996
   they position the pistons    

39
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:20,566
     on the connecting rods     
      now installed in the      
           crankcase.           

40
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,670
   remember those highlighted   
    cylinders made earlier?     

41
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,941
     workers now slide them     
       over the pistons.        

42
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,280
           these are            
  the cylinder-head castings.   

43
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,281
    technicians paint them      

44
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,485
     and then machine them      
   to fit on the cylinders.     

45
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,760
   a robot bolts them together  
              with              
    just the right amount of    
            torque.             

46
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:52,264
   the operator then installs   
     tubing that will house     
           pushrods.            

47
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:59,971
         he snaps them          
   into the cylinder heads.     

48
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:04,509
 then he clips on metal covers  
        to secure them.         

49
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,581
  he now inserts the pushrods   
        in the tubing.          

50
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,851
   up next is the electronic    
    fuel-injection system,      

51
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:15,988
         which controls         
     the flow of fuel to the    
            engine.             

52
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,924
        they install it         
  between the two cylinders.    

53
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,932
    a special bracket holds     
the injection system in place.  

54
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:33,606
   he bolts the rocker boxes    
    to the cylinder heads,      

55
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:38,544
   then tops off the assembly   
              with              
 more gleaming chrome covers.   

56
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,750
  the operator now screws the   
   oil filter onto the engine   
              case              

57
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:48,019
         and secures it         
    with a special wrench.      

58
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,089
     this is the electrical     
       charging system.         

59
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,159
  it goes on the crankshaft.    

60
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,499
   now it's time to pump oil    
    into this v-twin engine     

61
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,101
 and put it through its paces.  

62
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,304
 computerized testing equipment 
           moves in             

63
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,039
   and mates to the engine.     

64
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,777
      the engine rotates,       

65
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,046
       and they shift the       
          transmission          
    through all the gears.      

66
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,848
          this allows           
     the testing equipment      

67
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,052
    to analyze every aspect     
      of its performance.       

68
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:31,263
 next, they insert spark plugs  
   into the cylinder heads.     

69
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,666
           and these            
   1584cc motorcycle engines    

70
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,870
    are now revved and ready    
       for their wheels.        

71
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,488
           narrator:            
   enameling is the process     

72
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,958
   of fusing colored glass to   
              metal             
      with intense heat.        

73
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,228
 this decorative art developed  
  more than 3,000 years ago.    

74
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,431
 the earliest enameled objects  
   archeologists have found     

75
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,168
     are pieces of jewelry      
    made in ancient greece.     

76
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,572
   today, artisans most often   
     produce glass enamel on    
            copper.             

77
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,178
       artisans handcraft       
 these magnificent sculptures   

78
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,248
    by fusing vibrant colors    
    of finely ground glass      

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,817
       to solid copper.         

80
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,254
       first, the artist        
       draws the design,        

81
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,056
 then chooses the glass colors  

82
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,859
         from a palette         
    of hundreds of shades.      

83
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,928
   she takes one element at a   
              time              

84
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,364
  and makes multiple copies of  
               it               
     on a sheet of paper.       

85
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,067
         she has a lab          
   produce a film negative,     

86
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,670
         which she lays         
    in an exposure machine.     

87
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,139
on top, she lays a silk screen  

88
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,708
          coated with           
  a light-sensitive chemical.   

89
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,482
      then it exposes them      
     to halogen light for 90    
            seconds.            

90
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,884
       the film negative        
     works like a stencil.      

91
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,153
 its dark parts block the light 
    from hitting the screen     

92
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,823
     while its clear parts      
     allow light through.       

93
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,491
    where light penetrates,     

94
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,095
  the light-sensitive chemical  
      reacts and hardens.       

95
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,964
    the unhardened chemical     
         rinses away,           

96
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,768
leaving just the image behind.  

97
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,306
    in the next department,     

98
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,777
      they lay the screen       
   in a silk-screen printer,    

99
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,979
 apply chemical-resistant ink,  

100
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,847
           then load            
    a sheet of solid copper     

101
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,717
about half a millimeter thick.  

102
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,689
    the machine automatically   
             prints             
  the images onto the copper.   

103
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,862
  they cure the ink in an oven  
        for 20 minutes,         

104
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,064
          then repeat           
  the entire exposure process   

105
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,467
    for the back side of the    
             sheet.             

106
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,406
   next, they feed the sheet    
     into a two-step milling    
            machine.            

107
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,109
      it applies chemicals      
   that eat away any copper     

108
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:00,946
       that isn't coated        
   with the chemical-resistant  
              ink.              

109
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,948
   this cuts out the shapes.    

110
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,083
  then it strips off the ink,   

111
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,720
     which, by this point,      
    has served its purpose.     

112
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,360
  now they have a blank shape,  
   but it's completely flat.    

113
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,765
   to give it dimension, they   
 stamp it with a forming dye.   

114
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,701
   now the enameling process    
      can finally begin.        

115
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,238
    for each color grouping     
        of the design,          

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,972
 there's an aluminum stencil.   

117
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,575
  they lay down the first one   

118
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:33,111
   and sprinkle glass powder    
 in the first base-coat color,  

119
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,382
     which looks white now,     
     but comes out clear.       

120
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:39,451
     then a second stencil      

121
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,054
         for the second         
   base-coat color -- white.    

122
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,461
   the shape then goes into a   
              kiln              
      for about a minute        

123
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,065
  to liquefy the glass powder   
  and fuse it to the copper.    

124
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,404
   once the base coat cools,    

125
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:03,042
   they create the detail work  
              with              
     additional stencils and    
            colors.             

126
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,279
         this is where          
  the true artistry comes in.   

127
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,949
  each shake of powdered glass  
       is like a painter's      
          brushstroke.          

128
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,886
    too much, and the color     
    will come out too dark.     

129
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,354
          too little,           
 and it'll come out too light.  

130
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:20,793
     it takes an experienced    
            enameler            
     to get it just right.      

131
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,570
      they craft dimension      
      by blending colors        

132
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,707
   and by combining different   
              types             
   of glass in the design --    

133
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,944
 some transparent, some opaque, 
       some opalescent.         

134
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,315
        after every few         
     powder applications,       

135
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,452
     they return the piece      
         to the kiln,           

136
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:49,788
   where the intense heat --    
  1,600 degrees fahrenheit --   

137
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,525
 liquefies and fuses the glass  
        to the copper.          

138
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:57,262
  slowly but surely, they turn  
 what was a blank copper shape  

139
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,198
  into a vibrant work of art.   

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,467
 meanwhile, an artistic welder  

141
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,737
     skillfully creates the     
sculpture's metal framework --  

142
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,142
    in this case, branches on   
              which             
    copper-enamel birds will    
             perch.             

143
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:11,877
       he's using steel,        

144
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,547
   but frameworks can also be   
              made              
 of copper, bronze, or brass.   

145
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,815
 besides birds, this sculpture  

146
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,819
    features copper-enameled    
             leaves             
         and flowers.           

147
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,823
 their stems are bronze because 
 bronze fuses easily to steel.  

148
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,760
     with the framework and     
 background elements in place,  

149
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,364
      it's just a matter of     
            attaching           
   the main design elements.    

150
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:36,168
    some industrial-strength    
   hot glue does the trick.     

151
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,637
         a modern twist         
     on an ancient craft,       

152
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,808
 these glass-enamel sculptures  
 make a glistening impression.  

153
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,992
        narrator: today,        
 most commercially made paper   

154
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,460
    is made from wood pulp      

155
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:04,062
     treated with chemicals     
  and mechanically processed.   

156
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,430
     making paper by hand       

157
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,933
    is a craft that involves    
   techniques and materials     

158
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,401
          that go back          
  over 2,000 years in china.    

159
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,871
        these techniques        
    have evolved over time,     

160
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,642
    but the main ingredient     
       remains the same --      
          imagination.          

161
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,484
       handmade paper is a      
           distinctive          
 choice for a variety of uses,  

162
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,754
      from fine stationery      
  to limited-edition prints.    

163
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,357
   natural fibers, like linen   
   or these cotton remnants,    

164
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,127
     are the raw materials      
      for handmade paper.       

165
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:41,166
  workers place the cotton rag  
   and put it on a conveyer,    

166
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:45,237
   which leads into a machine   
              that              
chops it up into small pieces.  

167
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,246
     it collects in a bin,      
   ready for the next step,     

168
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,415
    called beating the rag.     

169
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,320
        workers pour out        
      the chopped-up rag        

170
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:04,957
 into a tub called a hollander  
  that is filling with water.   

171
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,594
          this machine          
    beats the material into a   
             pulp.              

172
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,863
    its only moving part --     

173
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,066
          a large roll          
    weighing several tons,      

174
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,269
  equipped with metal blades.   

175
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,405
   workers fill the hollander   
 with up to 800 pounds of rag.  

176
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,608
    once all the rag is in,     

177
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,810
    the giant roll descends     
     to begin the beating.      

178
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,479
        water pours down        
      to soak the fabric,       

179
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,550
           as workers           
   push it toward the roll.     

180
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,023
   they sometimes take paper    
    from previous batches,      

181
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,293
        known as broke,         
    and add it to the mix.      

182
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,372
 they may also add a little dye 
     to adjust the color,       

183
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,707
    depending on the desired    
            effect.             

184
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,311
 after eight hours of beating,  

185
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:02,447
          workers feel          
    the pulp's consistency.     

186
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,384
  they will then take samples   
        from this batch         

187
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:09,054
     to make sure it doesn't    
             contain            
  any unbeaten rag or knots.    

188
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,523
    next, they add colorful     
  scraps of paper to the pulp   

189
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,327
     to create a decorative     
            pattern.            

190
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,667
   to make a sheet of paper,    

191
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,071
      the vat man plunges       
 a wooden mold into the pulp.   

192
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,806
   as he lifts out the mold,    

193
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,274
          he shakes it          
     to even out the pulp.      

194
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,610
       water pours out,         

195
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,814
      leaving only fibers       
 caught on the mold's surface.  

196
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,683
  he removes the mold's frame,  
     known as the deckle,       

197
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,352
           and lowers           
    the corner of the mold      

198
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,554
   to drain away more water.    

199
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,562
  he places the mold facedown   
        on a wet felt,          

200
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,965
 then carefully lifts it away.  

201
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,168
        a sheet of paper        
     now lies on the felt,      

202
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,637
      which he then covers      
    with another wet felt.      

203
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,774
        when pulp pours         
    through the mold's metal    
            screen,             

204
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:06,177
       it traps the fiber       
  and lets the water through.   

205
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,514
  the vat man plunges the mold  
   once again into the pulp     

206
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:14,052
   and couches another sheet    
  of this distinctive paper.    

207
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:19,591
         at this point,         
    the paper is 99% water.     

208
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,460
     workers bring a stack      
   over to a hydraulic press    

209
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:26,798
   to draw the water from the   
              paper             
 and link the fibers together.  

210
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,934
   they press the papers with   
              care              

211
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,570
      so they don't burst       
    right out of the felts.     

212
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,477
  they brush any leftover pulp  
        from the felts,         

213
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:42,147
  leaving them clean and ready  
 for the next batch of sheets.  

214
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,752
   now workers can handle the   
              paper             
   without it falling apart.    

215
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,888
      they take the sheets      
        from the felts          

216
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,125
      and hang them to dry      
       on plastic tubes.        

217
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,932
     once dry, they collect     
 the sheets according to type   

218
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,768
         and stack them         
  for a final finishing press   

219
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,040
 before they go on for shipment 
to customers around the world.  

220
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,910
        the mold's frame        
   leaves a feathery edge --    

221
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,113
     a distinctive feature      
      of handmade paper.        

222
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,318
   these papers are available   
    in more than 30 colors      

223
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,822
      in various finishes,      
    from smooth to rugged.      

224
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,268
        there's a paper         
      for every project,        

225
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,404
    whether it's etching...     

226
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,539
         watercolor...          

227
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,275
          drawing...            

228
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,510
       or even folding.         

229
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,096
 narrator: pole-vaulting began  
 as a mode of transportation,   

230
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,564
         not a sport.           

231
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,299
in europe, men would use poles  

232
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,036
      to propel themselves      
   across bridgeless canals.    

233
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:15,239
       in the late 1800s,       
          pole-vaulting         
 caught on as a college sport.  

234
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,175
the athletes used bamboo poles  

235
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:20,145
      to vault themselves       
    over a horizontal bar.      

236
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,588
         today's poles          
  are incredibly lightweight,   

237
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,458
       yet strong enough        
     to absorb the vaulter's    
            energy,             

238
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,794
       then throw it back       
  to propel him over the bar.   

239
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,929
           some poles           
   are made of carbon fiber,    

240
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:42,934
others out of <i> this</i>  material - 
 resin-impregnated fiberglass.  

241
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,203
         the first step         
 is to spread out the material  

242
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,339
 and cut out the pole pattern.  

243
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,275
 meanwhile, a slitter machine   

244
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:53,945
     cuts the same material     
    into strips of a specific   
             width.             

245
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,215
    then it winds each strip    
      into its own roll.        

246
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:03,622
    this spiral-wrap machine    
   automatically unravels the   
             strip              

247
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:08,059
  and wraps it around a hollow  
 steel tube called a mandrel.   

248
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:17,168
 this first layer of fiberglass 
       gives the pole its       
          flexibility.          

249
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,505
    they wrap a second layer    
  in the opposite direction,    

250
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,842
 employing a crisscross pattern 
    to increase durability.     

251
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:27,078
   the second layer fortifies   
   the pole's circumference.    

252
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:33,918
     for the next layers,       

253
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,854
    they remove the mandrel     
   and lay it on the table.     

254
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:39,791
         now it's time          
 for those fiberglass patterns  

255
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,127
       they cut earlier.        

256
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,729
       they heat the edge       
of the first one with an iron,  

257
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,466
      melting the resin in      
    the fiberglass until it's   
             tacky.             

258
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,603
      they stick this edge      
        to the mandrel,         

259
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,272
    then slide the other end    
    between heated rollers.     

260
00:17:56,209 --> 00:18:00,144
  the rollers wrap the rest of  
     the material around the    
            mandrel,            

261
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,214
 the heat activating the resin  
        in the process.         

262
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,484
      the same procedure,       
 now with the second pattern.   

263
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,219
    this piece is critical,     

264
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:12,924
    because the way it's cut    
    controls the way the pole   
             bends.             

265
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,299
        the mandrel and         
its multilayer fiberglass coat  

266
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,034
     now go into an oven.       

267
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,169
 the heat, generated by steam,  

268
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,640
           starts at            
    175 degrees fahrenheit.     

269
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:33,578
   this liquefies the resin so  
              that              
       it re-saturates the      
          fiberglass.           

270
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,916
 then the temperature gradually 
 rises to nearly 300 degrees,   

271
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:43,054
  solidifying the resin again,  
          curing it.            

272
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:47,859
    this entire process takes   
              about             
    45 minutes from start to    
            finish.             

273
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,666
     and when it finishes,      
       a pole extractor         

274
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,804
   slides the mandrel out of    
 what's now a fiberglass pole.  

275
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,620
            the pole            
  moves onto a flex machine.    

276
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,023
    in part, this is a stress   
             test.              

277
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:23,762
 if there's any type of defect, 
 the pole will crack or break.  

278
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:25,497
        but the flexor          

279
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,233
     also permanently puts a    
            specific            
 degree of curve in the pole,   

280
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:33,037
    which helps the athlete     
         vault higher.          

281
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,507
  now they make what's called   
      the soft-side mark.       

282
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,177
  this helps the pole vaulter   
       locate the bend,         

283
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,646
        in order to know        
    where to grip the pole.     

284
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,788
        next, they apply        
    a maximum-weight label,     

285
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,192
      indicating how heavy      
      the vaulter can be.       

286
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,729
  to finish the surface now,    

287
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,998
      they mount the pole       
         on a spindle,          

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,934
    then run a polishing pad    
           over it.             

289
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:06,871
     then, using a solvent,     
  they clean off the debris.    

290
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,211
      now that the surface      
         is pristine,           

291
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,813
          they wrap it          
  in thin, lightweight tape.    

292
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,884
    different-colored tapes     
    designate different pole    
            styles.             

293
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,688
  they cap the top of the pole  
         with plastic,          

294
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,224
     then, at the bottom,       

295
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,761
     mallet on a molded tip     
     made of hard rubber.       

296
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,066
      the finishing touch       
 is the manufacturer's decal.   

297
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,441
 vaulting poles come in various 
   lengths, between 10 and 16   
             feet.              

298
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,710
        a pole designed         
     for a heavier vaulter      

299
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,780
   has to be stiffer than one   
designed for a lighter vaulter  

300
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,249
        because the pole        
   has to propel more weight    

301
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,618
     with the same degree of    
            bending.            

302
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,595
