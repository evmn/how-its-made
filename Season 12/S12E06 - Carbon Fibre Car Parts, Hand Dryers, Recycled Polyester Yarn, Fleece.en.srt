to transform the material into a
rigid car part, they begin with 

25
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,714
to transform the material into a
rigid car part, they begin with 
paste wax.                      

26
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,449
rigid car part, they begin with 
paste wax.                      
they brush it into the crevices 

27
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,451
paste wax.                      
they brush it into the crevices 
of a fiberglass mold.           

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,120
they brush it into the crevices 
of a fiberglass mold.           
this mold is for a car rocker   

29
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,454
of a fiberglass mold.           
this mold is for a car rocker   
panel.                          

30
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,723
this mold is for a car rocker   
panel.                          
the wax seals the mold and also 

31
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,592
panel.                          
the wax seals the mold and also 
serves as a nonstick coating.   

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:18,003
they protect the lip of the mold
with masking tape.              
then they spray a second        

33
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,871
with masking tape.              
then they spray a second        
nonstick substance, polyvinyl   

34
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,607
then they spray a second        
nonstick substance, polyvinyl   
alcohol, into the fiberglass

36
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,553
now they're ready for the       
carbon-fiber material.          
they unroll it and spray it with

37
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,956
carbon-fiber material.          
they unroll it and spray it with
adhesive.                       

38
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,491
they unroll it and spray it with
adhesive.                       
despite the nonstick coatings,

00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,893
adhesive.                       
despite the nonstick coatings,  
they'll want this fabric to     

40
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,962
despite the nonstick coatings,  
they'll want this fabric to     
stick to the mold for a while.  

41
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,863
they'll want this fabric to     
stick to the mold for a while.  
the glue will gradually dissolve

42
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,734
stick to the mold for a while.  
the glue will gradually dissolve
into the material.              

43
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,202
the glue will gradually dissolve
into the material.              
they press the glued            

44
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,770
into the material.              
they press the glued            
carbon-fiber material onto the  

45
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,971
they press the glued            
carbon-fiber material onto the  
lip of mold.

carbon-fiber material onto the  
lip of mold.                    
after all, they don't want any  

47
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,475
lip of mold.                    
after all, they don't want any  
wrinkles in this job.           

48
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:07,353
this material has yet to gain   
its steely strength, so they    
easily trim the excess.         

49
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:23,669
they layer the fabric seven     
times, again following the lines
of the mold.                    

50
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,604
times, again following the lines
of the mold.                    
they apply a permeable material 

51
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,172
of the mold.                    
they apply a permeable material 
called flow media to the        

52
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:32,644
they apply a permeable material 
called flow media to the        
carbon-fiber layers.            

53
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,480
called flow media to the        
carbon-fiber layers.            
they place plastic mesh on top  

54
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,381
carbon-fiber layers.            
they place plastic mesh on top  
of the flow media and tuck it   

55
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:43,222
they place plastic mesh on top  
of the flow media and tuck it   
into the curves of the mold.    

56
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,823
of the flow media and tuck it   
into the curves of the mold.    
they frame the layers with      

57
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,692
into the curves of the mold.    
they frame the layers with      
double-sided tape which sticks  

58
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,660
they frame the layers with      
double-sided tape which sticks  
because this area was taped off 

59
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,495
double-sided tape which sticks  
because this area was taped off 
earlier to protect it from the

earlier to protect it from the  
nonstick spray.                 
this strong double-sided tape is

62
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,003
nonstick spray.                 
this strong double-sided tape is
called butyl tape.

67
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:16,822
they pleat the bag and close the
pleat with more tape.           
the pleats give the plastic bag 

68
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:20,258
pleat with more tape.           
the pleats give the plastic bag

102
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,192
often have electric hand dryers.
many prefer them over           
paper-towel dispensers for      

103
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,628
many prefer them over           
paper-towel dispensers for      
environmental reasons -- no     

104
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,296
paper-towel dispensers for      
environmental reasons -- no     
trees killed and no waste.      

105
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,097
environmental reasons -- no     
trees killed and no waste.      
hand dryers also require less   

106
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,732
trees killed and no waste.      
hand dryers also require less   
maintenance because there's no  

107
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,567
hand dryers also require less   
maintenance because there's no  
garbage bin to empty and no need

108
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,036
maintenance because there's no  
garbage bin to empty and no need
to restock the machine with     

109
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,239
garbage bin to empty and no need
to restock the machine with     
clean paper towels.             

110
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:26,017
this new-generation model dries 
hands in 10 seconds and uses 80%
less energy than conventional   

111
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,085
hands in 10 seconds and uses 80%
less energy than conventional   
hand dryers.                    

112
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,254
less energy than conventional   
hand dryers.                    
a sensor turns the unit on and  

113
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,456
hand dryers.                    
a sensor turns the unit on and  
off automatically.              

114
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,791
a sensor turns the unit on and  
off automatically.              
a circuit board with a          

115
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:36,428
off automatically.              
a circuit board with a          
microprocessor runs everything. 

116
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,063
a circuit board with a          
microprocessor runs everything. 
the assembler builds a strip of 

117
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:43,501
microprocessor runs everything. 
the assembler builds a strip of 
eight control boards at a time. 

118
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,070
the assembler builds a strip of 
eight control boards at a time. 
they go into a track that first 

119
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,404
eight control boards at a time. 
they go into a track that first 
runs through a chemical         

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,005
they go into a track that first 
runs through a chemical         
cleaning.                       

121
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:51,509
runs through a chemical         
cleaning.                       
this preps them for soldering.  

122
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,212
cleaning.                       
this preps them for soldering.  
the boards then flow through    

123
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,947
this preps them for soldering.  
the boards then flow through    
molten solder.                  

124
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,615
the boards then flow through    
molten solder.                  
as it cools and solidifies, it  

125
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:02,621
molten solder.                  
as it cools and solidifies, it  
fuses the components in place.  

126
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,823
as it cools and solidifies, it  
fuses the components in place.  
an inspector scrutinizes every  

127
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,525
fuses the components in place.  
an inspector scrutinizes every  
board, then, wherever necessary,

128
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,227
an inspector scrutinizes every  
board, then, wherever necessary,
does soldering touch-ups by     

129
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,967
board, then, wherever necessary,
does soldering touch-ups by     
hand.                           

130
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,236
does soldering touch-ups by     
hand.                           
finally, they separate the eight

131
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:23,041
hand.                           
finally, they separate the eight
control boards.                 

132
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,976
finally, they separate the eight
control boards.                 
working a board at a time now,  

133
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,511
control boards.                 
working a board at a time now,  
they plug in and test an        

134
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,515
working a board at a time now,  
they plug in and test an        
infrared sensor.                

135
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,583
they plug in and test an        
infrared sensor.                
the sensor shoots a continuous  

136
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,519
infrared sensor.                
the sensor shoots a continuous  
beam to the area below the air  

137
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,186
the sensor shoots a continuous  
beam to the area below the air  
outlet.                         

138
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,321
beam to the area below the air  
outlet.                         
the testing machine uses a strip

139
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,324
outlet.                         
the testing machine uses a strip
of metal to represent hands.    

140
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,992
the testing machine uses a strip
of metal to represent hands.    
when the strip cuts the beam, it

141
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,460
of metal to represent hands.    
when the strip cuts the beam, it
triggers the dryer to start.    

142
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,928
when the strip cuts the beam, it
triggers the dryer to start.    
when it departs, the beam is    

143
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,896
triggers the dryer to start.    
when it departs, the beam is    
restored, triggering the dryer  

144
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,867
when it departs, the beam is    
restored, triggering the dryer  
to stop.                        

145
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,036
restored, triggering the dryer  
to stop.                        
to produce the air flow, a motor

146
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,005
to stop.                        
to produce the air flow, a motor
spins a blower wheel at a rate  

147
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,773
to produce the air flow, a motor
spins a blower wheel at a rate  
of 20,000 revolutions per       

148
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:58,777
spins a blower wheel at a rate  
of 20,000 revolutions per       
minute.                         

149
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,512
of 20,000 revolutions per       
minute.                         
after connecting the blower and 

150
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,614
minute.                         
after connecting the blower and 
motor, they slip them into the  

151
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:08,386
after connecting the blower and 
motor, they slip them into the  
unit's plastic inner housing.   

152
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,221
motor, they slip them into the  
unit's plastic inner housing.   
they add a rubber gasket to     

153
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,224
unit's plastic inner housing.   
they add a rubber gasket to     
lessen vibration noise then     

154
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,126
they add a rubber gasket to     
lessen vibration noise then     
close up the housing.           

155
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,107
next comes this electrical      
heating element.                
its coils will heat the air as  

156
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:31,443
heating element.                
its coils will heat the air as  
it passes.                      

157
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,045
its coils will heat the air as  
it passes.                      
after applying mandatory        

158
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,646
it passes.                      
after applying mandatory        
electrical warning stickers,    

159
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,414
after applying mandatory        
electrical warning stickers,    
they install the circuit board  

160
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,882
electrical warning stickers,    
they install the circuit board  
on a mounting bracket, then     

161
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,184
they install the circuit board  
on a mounting bracket, then     
connect the bracket to the      

162
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:44,289
on a mounting bracket, then     
connect the bracket to the      
housing.                        

163
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,757
connect the bracket to the      
housing.                        
then they connect the wires     

164
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,358
housing.                        
then they connect the wires     
coming from the heating element 

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,860
then they connect the wires     
coming from the heating element 
and the motor to the control    

166
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,462
coming from the heating element 
and the motor to the control    
board.                          

167
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,997
and the motor to the control    
board.                          
now they send the unit to the   

168
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,331
board.                          
now they send the unit to the   
testing area for, quite         

169
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:58,570
now they send the unit to the   
testing area for, quite         
literally, a dry run.           

170
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,539
testing area for, quite         
literally, a dry run.           
they make sure it turns on and  

171
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,074
literally, a dry run.           
they make sure it turns on and  
off properly.                   

172
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,908
they make sure it turns on and  
off properly.                   
they check the blowing force,   

173
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,410
off properly.                   
they check the blowing force,   
the air temperature, the        

174
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,946
they check the blowing force,   
the air temperature, the        
voltage.                        

175
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,781
the air temperature, the        
voltage.                        
elsewhere in the factory, they  

176
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,616
voltage.                        
elsewhere in the factory, they  
work on the hand dryer's outer  

177
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,283
elsewhere in the factory, they  
work on the hand dryer's outer  
housing.                        

178
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,886
work on the hand dryer's outer  
housing.                        
it's cast from zinc.            

179
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,688
housing.                        
it's cast from zinc.            
after it comes out of the mold, 

180
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,423
it's cast from zinc.            
after it comes out of the mold, 
they polish it with a buffing   

181
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,058
after it comes out of the mold, 
they polish it with a buffing   
wheel to prep the surface for   

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,960
they polish it with a buffing   
wheel to prep the surface for   
painting or chrome plating.     

183
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:32,203
in the plating tank, they run a 
positive electrical charge to   
chunks of metal and a negative  

184
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,638
positive electrical charge to   
chunks of metal and a negative  
charge to the zinc cover.       

185
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,106
chunks of metal and a negative  
charge to the zinc cover.       
this draws metal particles      

186
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,708
charge to the zinc cover.       
this draws metal particles      
through the water like a magnet 

187
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,510
this draws metal particles      
through the water like a magnet 
onto the surface of the cover in

188
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,445
through the water like a magnet 
onto the surface of the cover in
a thorough and even layer.      

189
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,747
onto the surface of the cover in
a thorough and even layer.      
for this model, they first plate

190
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,250
a thorough and even layer.      
for this model, they first plate
the cover in copper...          

191
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:51,056
for this model, they first plate
the cover in copper...          
then nickel...                  

192
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,223
the cover in copper...          
then nickel...                  
then chrome.                    

193
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,659
then nickel...                  
then chrome.                    
the underlay metals are required

194
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:59,964
then chrome.                    
the underlay metals are required
for the chrome to adhere.       

195
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,100
the underlay metals are required
for the chrome to adhere.       
once the plating's done, they   

196
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,504
for the chrome to adhere.       
once the plating's done, they   
clean the cover...              

197
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,140
once the plating's done, they   
clean the cover...              
apply an arrow sticker pointing 

198
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:13,345
clean the cover...              
apply an arrow sticker pointing 
to the air outlet...            

199

textures, this high-tech fabric 

434
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,477
will help protect you against

and with its recycled content,  

437
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,183
it also gives nature a bit of a
