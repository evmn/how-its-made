1
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,054
    narrator: if you've ever    
  looked inside a wind-up watch 

2
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,324
    or a car's transmission,    
 you've seen a system of gears. 

3
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,058
  a gear is a wheel with teeth  

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,595
   that meshes with the teeth   
         of another gear        

5
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,130
        to transmit power       
     on a continuous basis.     

6
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,933
         combining gears        
     of different diameters     

7
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,436
     affects rotation speed     
           and force.           

8
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,809
    this factory makes gears    

9
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:22,081
   that go into transmissions   
    for industrial machines.    

10
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,618
 production begins with a large,
 round bar of high-grade steel, 

11
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,953
         which contains         
   a certain amount of carbon   

12
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,056
    to make it even stronger.   

13
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:34,760
      an automated band saw     

14
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,162
       slices off a piece       
   that's the right thickness   

15
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,365
      for the size of gear      
         they're making.        

16
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,502
      this piece is called      
          a gear blank.         

17
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,375
      they mount the blank      
 on a computer-controlled blade.

18
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,977
          as it spins,          

19
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,548
   a turret carrying a series   
   of carbide tools moves in.   

20
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,586
  one tool after another takes  
  its turn machining the blank  

21
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,588
      to a specific shape.      

22
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,138
      a shower of coolant       
      prevents overheating      

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,407
      when the jumbo drill      
          has its turn.         

24
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,343
  it bores a hole right through 
    the middle of the blank.    

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,415
  the last tool carves a groove 
   on the front of the blank.   

26
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:32,852
 this final bit of metal removal
   lessens the gear's weight.   

27
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,823
     now the blank goes into    
   a computer-controlled mill.  

28
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,160
  the mill drills holes through 
   which lubrication will flow  

29
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,695
   when the gear is operating.  

30
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,868
    these holes also lighten    
       the gear's weight.       

31
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,105
         when the blank         
       comes off the mill,      

32
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,342
 they stamp it with the company 
      name and part number.     

33
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,984
    now for the gear's teeth.   

34
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:08,186
 a machine called a gear shaper 
 carves out the inner teeth --  

35
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,789
            the ones            
    lining the center hole --   

36
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,224
with its titanium-coated cutter.

37
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,528
 the machine's other components 

38
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,663
   keep the cutter's movement   
        correctly timed.        

39
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,734
  the number of teeth and tooth 
  size vary from gear to gear,  

40
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,471
 so for each model, the factory 
   has to fit the gear shaper   

41
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,007
     with a specific cutter.    

42
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,409
 now for the outside gear teeth.

43
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,813
 the computer-controlled machine
         that cuts them         

44
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,748
    is called a gear hobber.    

45
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,718
    the gear turns against it   
           as it cuts.          

46
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,163
if the hobber would cut the full
depth of the teeth in one shot, 

47
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,965
     the cutter would chip,     

48
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,834
    so the gear keeps turning   
     around and around again    

49
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,504
       as the hobber cuts       
   a bit more with each pass,   

50
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,840
         until the teeth        
      are the right depth.      

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,054
     then the gear undergoes    
   a computerized inspection.   

52
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:20,659
    a probe scans the entire    
 surface, including every tooth.

53
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,394
  it sends data to a computer,  

54
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,663
       which then analyzes      
         the dimensions         

55
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,900
      and ensures they meet     
 the engineering specifications.

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,671
         gears that pass        
 this quality-control inspection

57
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,207
        go into a furnace       
       for heat treatment.      

58
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,942
   this strengthens the steel.  

59
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,351
        when the furnace        
 reaches a certain temperature, 

60
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,286
   they inject carbon inside.   

61
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,823
  the gears absorb it, and the  
 steel strengthens even further.

62
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:55,961
   a soaking in oil afterward   
       hardens the metal.       

63
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,064
    heat treatment, however,    
    distorts steel somewhat,    

64
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,434
    so each gear now goes to    
 a computer-controlled grinder. 

65
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,104
        it restores them        
 to very precise specifications 

66
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,307
  for bearings to fit properly. 

67
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,182
 this factory manufactures gears
        in various sizes,       

68
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,850
     and not only in steel.     

69
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:21,520
 it also makes gears in material
    such as nylon, aluminum,    

70
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,856
   brass, and stainless steel.  

71
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,394
 some gears have straight teeth,
      others angled teeth,      

72
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:31,663
     which makes less noise     
          when turning.         

73
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,498
gears are an essential component

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,468
   in everything from watches   
   to heavy mining equipment,   

75
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,138
     keeping machinery going    
         at every turn.         

76
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,089
            narrator:           
 when it comes to wristwatches, 

77
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,492
   there's nothing quite like   
 a band made of genuine leather.

78
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,028
      it has a classic look     
        that's versatile,       

79
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,031
    working with both casual    
       and formal attire.       

80
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,701
     and a leather watchband    
      is always comfortable     

81
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,834
        against the skin        

82
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,572
   because, unlike synthetics,  
        leather breathes.       

83
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,980
    these premium watchbands    
     are made of alligator,     

84
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,383
 a leather with an unmistakable 
       texture and shine.       

85
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,723
      the tannery dyes the      
croc leathers in classic shades,

86
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:35,860
    as well as in the latest    
 high-fashion colors and styles.

87
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,530
 nearly all the production steps
           are manual,          

88
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,199
         beginning with         
     cutting leather pieces     

89
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,134
   for the band's two straps.   

90
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,270
      every watchband model     
     requires a steel cutter    

91
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,840
  for each strap in every size. 

92
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,349
   now they coat the back side  
    of each piece with glue.    

93
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,351
  later, when it's almost dry,  

94
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:01,887
  they center a watchband core  
            onto it.            

95
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,223
       this flexible form       
  is made of synthetic material 

96
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,526
   reinforced with fiberglass.  

97
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,231
         using a machine        
       with a fine blade,       

98
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,366
they make small cuts at the ends

99
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,736
to let the leather fold smoothly
         over the form.         

100
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,177
     one side of each strap     
   attaches to the watch face   

101
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,712
    with a spring-loaded bar.   

102
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:29,247
        they mark exactly       
       where the bar goes,      

103
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,384
     then punch a tiny hole     
       for its tiny base.       

104
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,462
        next, they apply        
       super-strength glue      

105
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,733
    and fold the leather over   
       to encase the bar.       

106
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,601
    the glue dries instantly.   

107
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,807
     they now coat the rest     
     of the form with glue,     

108
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,942
      then lay it in a mold     

109
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,478
    that pushes the leather     
    against the edge tightly    

110
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,247
       so they can neatly       
    fold over the remainder.    

111
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,690
    now they run the open end   
        through a machine       

112
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,726
    that cuts a beveled edge.   

113
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,763
  next, they run a tiny sander  
        over the leather        

114
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,032
        on the back side.       

115
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,833
   this roughens the surface,   

116
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,303
         which will help        
   the leather backing adhere.  

117
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,112
        to make the loops       
  which go on the buckle strap, 

118
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:36,382
       they bevel the ends      
    of small leather strips.    

119
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,653
     they glue and fold them    
          into a loop,          

120
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,024
making sure they're large enough
   to fit around both straps.   

121
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,198
          one loop sits         
   directly below the buckle.   

122
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,002
  a glued-over flap of leather  
      locks it in position.     

123
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,873
 they press it flat with pliers 
     to ensure a good bond.     

124
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,744
 they machine-stitch each strap 

125
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,547
          with strong,          
   polyethylene-based thread.   

126
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,954
to prevent unraveling, they melt
  them right into the leather.  

127
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,500
 on the buckle end, they pierce 
     two holes for stitches     

128
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,236
         that reinforce         
    the locked-in first loop.   

129
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,039
    then they punch two holes   
 in the back of the second loop 

130
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,376
   for stitching to reinforce   
    its glued-together ends.    

131
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,378
  this loop has to be movable,  

132
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,382
     so they don't stitch it    
          to the band.          

133
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,317
       they heat the edge       
         of each strap.         

134
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,154
  the iron's rounded tip molds  
  an attractive, rounded edge.  

135
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,326
   using a heated tool again,   

136
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,930
 they widen the channel through 
   which the buckle will pass.  

137
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,935
 now they insert the buckle end 
     into a stamping press.     

138
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,438
         it cuts a slot         
    for the buckle's tongue.    

139
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,212
a heat press burns the company's
  name into the leather lining. 

140
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:16,548
         that same strap        
     then goes into a press,    

141
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,284
 which punches the sizing holes.

142
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:23,955
  from here, both straps go off 
    to the buckle department.   

143
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,957
  random samples are subjected  

144
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,493
           to rigorous          
    quality-control testing.    

145
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,230
       this machine pulls       
      the ends of the strap     

146
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:35,033
 in opposite directions, with up
 to nearly 50 pounds of tension,

147
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,036
 far more than anyone would ever
     apply to the watchband     

148
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,572
  when they pull to buckle it.  

149
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,260
            narrator:           
   vitrelle is a super-durable  
       dinnerware material      

150
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,897
  invented in the united states 
       in the early 1970s.      

151
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,668
    it's made of three layers   
    of glass, fused together.   

152
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,271
         vitrelle dishes        
    are thin and lightweight,   

153
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:15,206
      yet they're stronger      
  and far more break-resistant  

154
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,109
    than ordinary dinnerware.   

155
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:24,683
       in a perfect union       
  of form, function, and food,  

156
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,018
     this company serves up     
       vitrelle dinnerware      

157
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,354
  in several striking designs.  

158
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:36,294
       the dishes are made      
      of 65% recycled glass     

159
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,765
  from earlier production runs. 

160
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,701
      to make the other 35%     
        that's new glass,       

161
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,370
      the factory combines      
    several raw materials --    

162
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,971
             sand...            

163
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,040
             salt...            

164
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,574
          limestone...          

165
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,975
           feldspar...          

166
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,444
   and two more types of salt.  

167
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:56,248
      the exact proportions     
  are a closely guarded secret. 

168
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,585
         the ingredients        
       go into a furnace,       

169
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,155
          where a fiery         
    2,500 degrees fahrenheit    

170
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:06,792
  melts them into liquid glass. 

171
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,527
      it exits the furnace.     

172
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,796
     an extruder shapes it      
     into a three-ply sheet     

173
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,200
     that lands in a mold --    
   in this case, a plate mold.  

174
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,071
 a trimmer cuts off the excess, 

175
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,540
      while compressed air      
      blows down from above     

176
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:25,077
 to cool and solidify the glass.

177
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,879
          a vacuum arm          
    then extracts each dish,    

178
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,082
 and the leftovers are recycled.

179
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,489
     the dishes now undergo     
  what's called fire polishing. 

180
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,626
     each one passes through    
       a gas-oxygen flame,      

181
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,628
           which seals          
   the three layers of glass.   

182
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,097
  it also melts the outer rim,  

183
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,432
   smoothing and rounding out   
         the rough edge         

184
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,434
    created by the trimming.    

185
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,774
        oval dishes go on       
   a different fire polisher,   

186
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,211
    designed for an oval rim    
    rather than a round one.    

187
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:25,737
  now the conveyor system flips 
each dish over for backstamping.

188
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,240
           the bottom           
     of every vitrelle dish     

189
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:33,545
       has the trade name       
     and other information.     

190
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,381
     a silk-screen machine      
     applies the lettering.     

191
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,258
      then a gas-air flame      
  bakes the ink into the glass. 

192
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,296
        once that's done,       

193
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,701
    the conveyor system flips   
 the dishes right side up again.

194
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,103
     to decorate the dishes,    

195
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:03,708
     a machine silk-screens     
   the design onto membranes.   

196
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:09,514
robotic arms position a membrane
        above each dish.        

197
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,318
  then a press head pushes the  
 membrane down onto the surface,

198
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,587
     transferring the paint.    

199
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,930
          robotic arms          
      then move the dishes      

200
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,266
   back onto a conveyor belt.   

201
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:44,249
  certain dishes have a design  
         on the outside.        

202
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,020
an automated silk-screen machine

203
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,356
        applies the paint       
    directly to the surface.    

204
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,163
      the decorated dishes      
now travel through a tunnel oven

205
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,966
       for 5 1/2 minutes.       

206
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,502
           the nearly           
  1,500-degree fahrenheit heat  

207
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,705
     cures the enamel paint.    

208
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,373
     at the end of the ride,    

209
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,177
       a tempering process      
 that makes the glass stronger. 

210
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,516
 then, nozzles spray the dishes 
    in a soy-based silicone.    

211
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:21,987
 this wash-off coating prevents 
   scratches during packaging.  

212
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,390
  the factory subjects a sample 
    from each production run    

213
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:30,061
    to a 6 1/2-foot-drop test   
     and a rim-impact test.     

214
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,532
 the sample mustn't break, chip,
           or crack...          

215
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,670
        ...all to ensure        
     this stylish dinnerware    

216
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:43,074
     will withstand whatever    
  your household can dish out.  

217
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,096
 narrator: shears are typically 
      larger than scissors,     

218
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,532
    for heavier-duty cutting.   

219
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,167
       and you can insert       
       up to three fingers      

220
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,036
  in the handle's finger ring.  

221
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,106
       using more fingers       
   gives you a stronger grasp,  

222
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:19,311
   which translates into more   
 control and more cutting force.

223
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,519
      these high-end shears     

224
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,921
          effortlessly          
     slice through produce,     

225
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:34,392
        snip fresh herbs,       
       and open packaging.      

226
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,530
      outside the kitchen,      
 they easily cut many materials,

227
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,866
     including thin aluminum    
      and galvanized steel.     

228
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,602
  the secret to their strength? 

229
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,470
 blades made of stainless steel,

230
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,540
         which contains         
   a minute amount of carbon.   

231
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,207
          to make them,         

232
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,743
   workers feed a bar of this   
   high-carbon stainless steel  

233
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,812
          into a press.         

234
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:57,949
   it stamps out blade shapes   
         called blanks.         

235
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,819
         stainless steel        
       can be heat-treated      

236
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,955
    to make it more durable     
    and corrosion-resistant.    

237
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:08,560
but first, a furnace softens the
 blanks for the forging process 

238
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:12,097
      that transforms them      
          into blades.          

239
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,433
           each blank           
     goes onto a forging dye    

240
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,235
          that has two          
     blade-shaped cavities.     

241
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,505
       one strike in each,      
    and the blank is a blade.   

242
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,976
         once it cools,         

243
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,579
        a trimming press        
  cuts off all the excess metal 

244
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,114
      around the perimeter.     

245
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,855
       heating and forging      
       tend to warp steel,      

246
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,791
so another press makes the blade
         perfectly flat         

247
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,459
       and straight again.      

248
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,936
    trimming the excess metal   
    leaves some rough areas,    

249
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:56,541
  so the next step is to smooth 
the surface with a sanding belt.

250
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,415
  to make the hole for the bolt 
   on which the blades pivot,   

251
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,086
     they drill a round hole    
       partway through...       

252
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,223
 then pierce a rectangular hole 
        through the rest.       

253
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,426
    you'll see why later on.    

254
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,498
         now the blades         
    undergo heat treatment --   

255
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,835
  first, to harden them, a slow 
   heating and rapid cooling,   

256
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,438
       then, to make them       
       tough and durable,       

257
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,040
   a reheat and slow cooling.   

258
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,579
 a grinder shapes the round area
        next to the tang,       

259
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,482
   the term for the metal core  
         of the handle.         

260
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,317
      with a sanding belt,      

261
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,888
    they smooth out and blend   
      the adjacent corners.     

262
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:52,330
   here, two polishing wheels   
        give the surface        

263
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,199
    an upscale satin finish.    

264
00:18:56,737 --> 00:19:00,138
  then an etching machine uses  
electrically activated chemicals

265
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,275
 to imprint the company's name  
 into the thumb-operated blade. 

266
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:10,215
       just one final step      
 before the blades are finished.

267
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,816
   a computer-operated grinder  

268
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,787
    serrates the inside edge    
  of the thumb-operated blade.  

269
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,760
        workers now load        
      six blades at a time      

270
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,162
    into an injection-molding   
            machine.            

271
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,432
   the machine shoots molten    
   plastic into the cavities,   

272
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,935
 then rapidly cools the material
      until it solidifies.      

273
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,440
  each blade exits the machine  
      with a molded handle      

274
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,942
    firmly encasing the tang.   

275
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,713
  now for the final assembly -- 

276
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:45,049
     first they drive a bolt    
     with a rectangular head    

277
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:49,387
       into the pivot hole      
  of the finger-operated blade. 

278
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,056
          then they add         
    the thumb-operated blade    

279
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,526
    and press the bolt again    
    into its final position.    

280
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,728
  a self-locking, hexagonal nut 

281
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,398
        secures the bolt        
        from underneath.        

282
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:09,007
     an automatic tightener     
   does the initial fastening.  

283
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,610
    then workers do the final   
  tension adjustment manually.  

284
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,351
         the final step         

285
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:24,288
 is to grind the excess plastic 
      off the handle stops.     

286
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,259
 this enables the blade to close
 fully and in perfect alignment.

287
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,968
  so, why the rectangular bolt? 

288
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,770
         watch closely.         

289
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,305
         it allows you,         
   with just one simple twist,  

290
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,774
     to separate the blades     
          for cleaning          

291
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,712
    and then reassemble them.   

292
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,982
now, that's cutting-edge design.
