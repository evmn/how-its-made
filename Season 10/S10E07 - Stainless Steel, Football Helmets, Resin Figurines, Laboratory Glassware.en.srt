grippers place the vials on a

rack headed for the oven where  

476
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,177
they'll bake for about 20

00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,681
minutes.

the finished vials to packaging.

480
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,589
from there, it's off to a blood

481
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:01,091
bank, a hospital, or chemistry
