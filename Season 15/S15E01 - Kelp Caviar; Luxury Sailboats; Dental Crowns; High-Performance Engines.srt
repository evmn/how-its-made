00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,320
            narrator:           
         caviar is made         

2
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:58,591
 by processing the unfertilized 
eggs of certain species of fish.

3
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:01,660
  for those who love the taste  
       but not the price,       

4
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,197
    there's simulated caviar    
made of kelp, a type of seaweed.

5
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,132
     a fraction of the cost,    

6
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:11,003
  it looks, smells, and tastes  
   similar to the real thing.   

7
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:19,211
 unlike fish caviar, the source 
   of kelp caviar is a plant,   

8
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,881
        so it's fat-free,       
        cholesterol-free,       

9
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,216
     and has zero calories.     

10
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,286
       this company makes       
     its kelp caviar plain,     

11
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,887
      which is vegetarian,      

12
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,023
 as well as in several flavors. 

13
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,159
 kelp is chock-full of vitamins 
          and minerals          

14
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,363
     and is especially rich     
           in iodine.           

15
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:41,166
being a marine plant, it's quite
   different from land plants   

16
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,769
     in that its consistency    
         is gelatinous,         

17
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,972
    which makes it ideal for    
 producing little rubbery balls 

18
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,908
    that resemble fish eggs.    

19
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,511
   at the kelp caviar factory,  

20
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:56,381
 they begin production with kelp
  that's been dried naturally,  

21
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,651
 then ground into a fine powder.

22
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,459
 the other ingredients are salt,
          citric acid,          

23
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,728
     and, if they're making     
       a flavored variety,      

24
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,263
        natural flavoring       
         in liquid form.        

25
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,604
    they add the ingredients    
    one at a time to water.     

26
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,551
the mixer blends them thoroughly
       for about an hour,       

27
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,254
            producing           
   a thick, gelatinous liquid.  

28
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,425
    they transfer the mixture   
           into a pot           

29
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,293
            connected           
    to an extrusion machine.    

30
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,905
  the machine pumps the mixture 

31
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,909
       through what looks       
       like a showerhead,       

32
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,377
   only instead of outputting   
        a steady stream,        

33
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,247
    it squeezes out droplets,   

34
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:04,449
    producing tiny kelp balls   
         called pearls,         

35
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,119
           which look           
     exactly like fish eggs.    

36
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:12,391
      the pearls drop into      
     a coagulation solution.    

37
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,726
        besides providing       
         a soft landing,        

38
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,663
       this solution helps      
     hold the pearls' shape.    

39
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:30,710
  the pearls roll down a chute  
    into waiting containers.    

40
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,380
the water drains out the bottom.

41
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,424
  workers empty the containers  
      into large colanders.     

42
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,965
         then they rinse        
      and strain the pearls     

43
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,835
      to ensure they're all     
     a certain minimum size.    

44
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,369
    pearls that are too small   

45
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,839
           simply fall          
  through the colander's holes. 

46
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,575
         they weigh out         
       a specific quantity      

47
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,244
           and mix in           
    an all-natural stabilizer   

48
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:09,482
required to maintain the pearls'
    texture and round shape.    

49
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,791
          the factory's         
       quality-control lab      

50
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,659
  tests a sample from the batch 

51
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,329
    to make sure the ph level   
         is just right.         

52
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:27,266
       careful ph control,      
  coupled with pasteurization,  

53
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,302
   is why this product doesn't  
   require any preservatives.   

54
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,941
    at the packaging station,   
    workers fill glass jars,    

55
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,344
      then twist a tin lid      
         onto each one.         

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,015
      then the jars go into     
    a pasteurization machine.   

57
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,818
       it heats the caviar      
      to a high temperature     

58
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,020
 for a specific period of time, 

59
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,222
  which kills off any bacteria. 

60
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:54,160
  this ensures a two-year shelf 
   life without refrigeration.  

61
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:57,830
    once opened, the product    
    stays fresh in the fridge   

62
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,431
        for three months.       

63
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,968
     after printing each lid    
        with a lot number       

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,904
     for tracking purposes,     

65
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:08,040
 all that's left to do is dress 
 the jar in a cardboard label.  

66
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:18,316
     kelp caviar contains no    
  artificial colors or flavors. 

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,652
 unlike certain types of caviar,

68
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,522
     it doesn't bleed color     
    to the surrounding food,    

69
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,957
        even when baked.        

70
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,194
      and while real caviar     

71
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,798
    is typically either black   
 sturgeon roe or red salmon roe,

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,135
        kelp caviar comes       
     in additional flavors,     

73
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,905
    such as truffle, cognac,    
           and wasabi.          

74
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,424
   narrator: luxury sailboats   
   evoke thoughts of freedom    

75
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,025
    and sunsets on the ocean,   

76
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,095
       but in the factory,      
    it's all about hard work,   

77
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:06,431
    because luxury sailboats    
 are still mostly made by hand. 

78
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,435
    just a few hundred units    
    are produced every year,    

79
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:13,272
       each boat requiring      
   up to 3,000 hours of work.   

80
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,178
 sailboats have come a long way 

81
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,514
   since they were first used   
        on the nile river       

82
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,617
      some 6,000 years ago.     

83
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,922
     these luxury sailboats     
          are designed          

84
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,124
      using computer-aided      
        design software,        

85
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,527
   which allows the engineers   
   to optimize the hull shape   

86
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,129
     for stability and speed    

87
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,531
         before actually        
       building the boat.       

88
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,400
       they build the hull      
        from fiberglass,        

89
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,603
  which comes as knitted fabric 

90
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,474
  and as mats of random strands 
        pressed together.       

91
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,809
 these two layers are hybridized

92
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,880
         to form a light        
    but very strong material.   

93
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:59,485
  huge molds are used to build  
 the hull of this 45-foot boat. 

94
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:03,689
  workers unroll the fiberglass 
    and spray it with resin.    

95
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,560
 then they unroll the next layer
         of fiberglass,         

96
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,495
which overlaps the previous one,

97
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,165
    making for a very strong    
          construction.         

98
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:18,103
 the resin hardens as it cures. 

99
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,841
     boat parts are so large    
            and heavy           

100
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,377
     that they must be moved    
          with cranes.          

101
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,579
this part is called the transom.

102
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,649
 it will be attached to the hull
         with fiberglass        

103
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,252
      while it and the hull     
     are still in the molds,    

104
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,921
     creating what's called     
     a monaco construction.     

105
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,924
 this hull surface will receive 
      the structural grid,      

106
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,127
 which will support the engine, 
        mast, fuel tank,        

107
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,129
        and water tanks.        

108
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,799
  meanwhile, carpenters fashion 
      the wood components.      

109
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,934
this door is made of solid teak,

110
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,472
       a durable hardwood       
       that doesn't rot.        

111
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,874
   the wood parts are then put  
       into a curing oven       

112
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,476
   at 122 degrees fahrenheit.   

113
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,714
    air is circulated to cure   
the varnish in about 11 minutes.

114
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,285
     bright lights also help    
        cure the varnish.       

115
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,889
 it's time to put the divisions 
            in place.           

116
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,490
    the hull liner has slots    

117
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,828
       designed to receive      
  the various wood components.  

118
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,098
  each part is fitted twice --  

119
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,300
     first to check the fit,    

120
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,802
        then permanently        
  with high-strength adhesive.  

121
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,147
it's time to install the engine.

122
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:39,251
     with its 54 horsepower,    
 the boat can cruise at 8 knots,

123
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,153
       even when the wind       
         isn't blowing.         

124
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:49,261
 this stainless-steel structure 
 serves to reinforce the rudder.

125
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,630
 it's attached with epoxy glue. 

126
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:01,406
 after closing the rudder mold, 
    they insert a paper cone    

127
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,343
  to completely fill the rudder 
       with urethane foam.      

128
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,649
  the foam expands as it cures. 

129
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,889
they finish by carefully sanding
    the edges of the rudder,    

130
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,725
      which is now attached     
      underneath the hull.      

131
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,433
    to build the boat's deck,   

132
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,970
  molds for the top and bottom  
     parts must be aligned.     

133
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:36,341
 high-strength bonding material 
 is applied at specific spots.  

134
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,980
        the two molds are       
   carefully fitted together.   

135
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,389
  when the parts are perfectly  
  joined, the mold is removed.  

136
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,493
      the deck is now ready     
    to be fitted on the boat.   

137
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,404
     workers carefully line     
         everything up.         

138
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,814
      luxury sailboats have     
   enough space for many rooms  

139
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,885
      and can be customized     
 with appliances and electronics

140
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,154
 that suit the customer's needs 
           and tastes.          

141
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,892
      all that's needed now     
    is a dip in the test pool   

142
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,228
   for a check of the engine,   
           generator,           

143
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,463
  and other mechanical systems. 

144
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,435
    after about three months    
          of hard work,         

145
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:40,939
  the boat is now ready to set  
  sail for offshore adventures. 

146
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,260
narrator: dental work dates back
        to ancient egypt,       

147
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:03,861
  when people used animal teeth 
       and pieces of bone       

148
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,597
   to replace their own teeth.  

149
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,399
  it couldn't have been pretty, 

150
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,735
           but today,           
     high-tech dental crowns    

151
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,804
   can transform damaged teeth  
       into pearly whites       

152
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,440
            that look           
     just like all the rest.    

153
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,216
  a dental crown starts with a  
plaster impression of the mouth.

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,688
    it goes to a laboratory,    
 where they cut it into segments

155
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,025
      to isolate the tooth      
     in need of restoration.    

156
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,695
  they scan it into a computer  

157
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,098
     and send the dimensions    
 electronically to the factory. 

158
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,238
     there, machinery pumps     
    liquid plaster into molds   

159
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,041
       to create cylinders      
         called blanks.         

160
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:52,911
     the plaster blanks take    
   about 10 minutes to harden,  

161
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,448
      then move on to cure      
   for an additional 12 hours.  

162
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,786
      at the next station,      

163
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,923
    a robot installs a blank    
      in a milling machine.     

164
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,459
   a computerized cutting tool  
       sculpts the blank,       

165
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,230
   guided by the scanned data   
     of the plaster replica.    

166
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,201
      it makes a duplicate      
    that's 20% to 30% larger    

167
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,338
 to allow for material shrinkage
      later in production.      

168
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:33,084
 next, a device dips the plaster
    tooth in liquid ceramic,    

169
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,088
          which hardens         
     into a nonstick glaze.     

170
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,228
         the next robot         
       orients the tooth,       

171
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,562
   along with several others,   

172
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,698
      in a circular holder,     

173
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,101
    ready for the next phase    
         of production.         

174
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,039
  nozzles funnel ceramic powder 
           into molds           

175
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,442
     arranged in a matching     
     circular configuration.    

176
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,781
      a robot then inserts      
       the tooth replicas       

177
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,050
   in the corresponding molds.  

178
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,255
     a worker stacks several    
      of the mold platters      

179
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,324
    and threads them together   
        with a metal rod.       

180
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:17,262
  he transfers the rack of mold 
  platters to the next worker,  

181
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,399
       who plunges it into      
     a water-filled chamber.    

182
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,671
 he closes the lid and activates
     a pressurizing system.     

183
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,740
   as the liquid pressurizes,   

184
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:32,477
    it compresses the ceramic   
     powder, solidifying it.    

185
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,013
          this process          
     takes just 10 minutes.     

186
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,218
   another automated tool now   
chisels away the excess ceramic,

187
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,822
      following the profile     
  of the plaster tooth replica  

188
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,757
      that's still inside.      

189
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,826
 this creates the ceramic shell 
      of the dental crown,      

190
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,162
       called the coping.       

191
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,632
          it's removed          
    from the plaster replica,   

192
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,068
  thanks to the nonstick glaze. 

193
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,238
        baking the coping       
   at a very high temperature   

194
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
      toughens the ceramic.     

195
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,510
 it also shrinks the crown shell
       to the final size.       

196
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,714
    they carve a plastic copy   
          of the tooth,         

197
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:14,186
   using the same data scanned  
   into the computer earlier.   

198
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:18,724
they use this plastic replica to
test the fit of the ceramic one.

199
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:25,730
      a technician inspects     
the ceramic for chips or cracks,

200
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,300
 then packages it for shipping. 

201
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:35,206
  this tooth-like shell is now  
  on its way to the laboratory, 

202
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,142
        where it will get       
      the finishing touches     

203
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,978
     that will transform it     
          into a crown.         

204
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,882
   when it arrives at the lab,  

205
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,153
  a technician paints several   
  layers of porcelain onto it.  

206
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,824
      the color will change     
     to a more-realistic hue    

207
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,527
        once they fire it       
      in a special furnace.     

208
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,904
    the furnace pumps out air   
         or other gases         

209
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,239
 that would hinder the transfer 
             of heat            

210
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,343
    as it bakes the porcelain   
  to a very dense consistency.  

211
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,848
      after all the layers      
       have been applied,       

212
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,252
      a technician textures     
 the surface with a sharp tool. 

213
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:24,922
      then, she sculpts it      
 to give it tooth-like contours.

214
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,726
     finally, she brushes on    
     a clear ceramic glaze,     

215
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,197
      which mimics the look     
        of tooth enamel.        

216
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,867
    ceramic crowns like these   
  take about five days to make. 

217
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,404
   they'll look and function    
   just like any other tooth,   

218
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,207
           and no one           
    need ever know the secret   

219
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,075
  behind that beautiful smile.  

220
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,091
            narrator:           
    high-performance engines    

221
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,626
  are technology-packed marvels 

222
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,895
       that are the result      
       of exacting design,      

223
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,898
     modern engineering, and    
 a constant need for innovation.

224
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
         producing them         
       requires the skills      

225
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,902
     of many highly trained     
          technicians.          

226
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,905
  it's the lucky few that will  
  get to enjoy the performance  

227
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,975
           and thrills          
   these engines can provide.   

228
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:24,048
   under the hood of this car   
          is the latest         

229
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,585
         in a long line         
     of performance engines,    

230
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,621
        legendary as much       
 for their power as their looks.

231
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,328
    each generation of engine   
  delivers an increase in power 

232
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,996
   and a reduction in weight,   

233
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:42,534
 meaning today's engines consume
 less fuel and produce less co2.

234
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,872
  at the heart of every engine  
      is the engine block.      

235
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,874
  it begins with a set of molds 

236
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:53,478
       cast from a mixture      
   of special sand and resin.   

237
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,781
 technicians glue the mold parts
            together.           

238
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,219
       using a hand file,       
   they make final adjustments  

239
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,291
 by sculpting the sand mold down
      to the finest detail.     

240
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:10,161
 an automated machine releases  
 molten aluminum into the mold. 

241
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,035
     after a cooling period,    

242
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,071
  the machine releases the part 
         from the mold.         

243
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,046
        they must remove        
        all of the sand,        

244
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,383
 which formed the hollow spaces 
       inside the engine.       

245
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,789
         they spray-wash        
        the cylinder head       

246
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,025
          to clear away         
      any remaining debris.     

247
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,998
    technicians now begin to    
 pre-assemble the cylinder head 

248
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,900
      and intake manifold.      

249
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,805
    every part of the engine,   
   such as this cylinder head,  

250
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,406
    is made from aluminum --    

251
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,577
   expensive but lightweight.   

252
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,519
      here, robots immerse      
valve guides in liquid hydrogen.

253
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,889
  this causes them to contract  

254
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,326
 so they can be easily inserted 
    into the cylinder heads.    

255
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:20,098
  as the valve guides warm up,  
      they expand slightly,     

256
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,167
    which holds them in place   
          permanently.          

257
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,839
        one set of valves       
  lets fuel into the cylinder.  

258
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,308
   the other lets exhaust out.  

259
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,577
with a blast of pressurized air,

260
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,447
     workers verify that the    
 manifold's air-intake passages 

261
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,216
   have been properly formed.   

262
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,387
  using a specially made tool,  

263
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,957
 they verify the exact dimension
         of each valve.         

264
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,596
      they visually inspect     
  each cylinder head for debris 

265
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,264
        and minor faults.       

266
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:01,306
 if it passes, a worker tags it 
       with an i.d. plate.      

267
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,745
     here technicians insert    
    the valves into position,   

268
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,981
    then test their movement.   

269
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,352
              next,             
   they machine the crankshaft  

270
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,755
        down to its final       
         specifications,        

271
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:20,225
   and the entire assembly is   
 positioned in the engine block.

272
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,599
     a technician lubricates    
     the cylinder liners...     

273
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,304
      ...then inserts them      
      into the cylinders.       

274
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,244
    they tap the liners into    
 position with a rubber mallet. 

275
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,047
 then, using a bit of lubricant,

276
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,850
     they insert the pistons    
       and connecting rods      

277
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,952
       into each cylinder.      

278
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,595
          with the aid          
   of an automatic torque gun,  

279
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,530
       technicians secure       
       the connecting rods      

280
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,965
       to the crankshaft,       

281
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,802
           then verify          
     the crankshaft spacing.    

282
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:14,045
     next, workers position     
  and bolt in the valve cover.  

283
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,154
        then they install       
     the air-intake manifold    

284
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,222
      on top of the engine      

285
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,226
           and attach           
   the fuel-injection system.   

286
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:37,034
they hook up the finished engine

287
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,304
          to a machine          
      called a dynamometer,     

288
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,173
   which measures every aspect  
      of engine performance     

289
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,209
  down to the smallest detail.  

290
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,316
and now for the ultimate test --
         the road test.         

291
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,384
         [ engine revs ]
