the edge dyeing machine process,

  the pattern of perforations,  

64
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,833
    which make up the belt's    
   signature design elements.   

65
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,370
 since the machine's die is less
      than 20 inches long,      

66
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,507
  the complex pattern along the 
 belt can't be stamped at once. 

67

instead, the machine punches out
       a section at a time      

68
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,548
 resulting in a production rate

73
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,998
      at the next station,      
  a craftswoman fills the holes 

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,801

76
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,539
   the nail heads are made of   
    zinc with a brass finish.

 ensuring that all of the holes 
   are filled with nail heads.  

81
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:52,491
 then she turns the belt around 
   and places it over the die   

82
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,327
     before sliding the belt    
        inside the press.       

83
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,864
the press affixes the nail heads
         to the leather.

  before attaching the buckle,  

85

    a process called skiving.   

86
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,709
     this device shaves off     
    a section of the leather    

87
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,345
 so that when it's folded over, 
     it won't be too thick.     

88
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,383
       a loop is attached       
   on to the end of the belt,

the glass and resin material are

257
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,303

      he inserts the piston

317
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,927

318
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,998

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,335
   the fit must be precise to   
   prevent the circulating air

342
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,546

346
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,159

353
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,379
     a heavy brass flywheel     
           is mounted.          

354
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,782
     the flywheels increase

356
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,588
     one end of a drive belt    
     is run around a pulley

362
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,876

363
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,611
    and the wick is attached.   

364
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,681
    the burner case is placed   
   under the heating cylinder,  

365
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,084
         light the wick,        
   and let the engine preheat   

366
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,085
      for 10 to 15 seconds,     

367
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:31,022
     then turn a flywheel to    
      kickstart the engine.     

368
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,625
     the flame heats the air    
  inside the heating cylinder.  

369
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,428
       the hot air expands      
   into the cooling cylinder,   

370
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,431
