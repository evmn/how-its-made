aboriginal peoples have used drums         

5
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,659
to call on healing spirits.   

6
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,329
but the sound of the drum itself can be a source of renewal.   

7
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,798
the repetitive beat can induce a meditative state

17
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,835
they start with pieces of pine or spruce --

soft woods that are lightweight.          

19

soaks a cowhide in water to make it soft and pliable.   

23
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,785
he drapes the wet hide over a drum frame        

24
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,456
and as he does, he looks for cuts or thin patches.    

25
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,659
he arranges it so that any flaws aren't apparent.         

26
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,594
he then trims the hide.

it's a two-sided version for a deeper tone.        

30
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,537
he pulls the wet hide to the desired tension      

31
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,873
and punches holes in the skirting.         

32
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,875
he hammers nails through the holes        

33
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:26,412
to tack the hide to the frame and cuts a scalloped edge.    

34
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:29,881
he then tacks a hide to the other side.        

35
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,885
he places another piece of wet rawhide on a spiral blade              

36
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,890
and pounds the hide into it using a hickory mallet.     

37
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:41,493
this slices the leather into a long, thin lace.     

38
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,164
he extracts the lace from the cutter.         

39

he now laces the leather drumheads to the frame.     

44
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,383
he cuts a slit in the end    
and pulls the rest of the lace  

45

through the slit to knot it to the drumhead.   

46

through alternate holes     
in the the two drumhead hides.

he threads the second piece of lace             

52
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,043
through the remaining holes,

cutting away weaker canes and dead wood.

00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,535
pruning reduces the number of buds.

the conveyer and the bins are on board.          

131

the t-trellises require     
a different harvesting system,

and the bins are outside in the next row.         

133
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,820
once full, a loader retrieves the bin,   

134
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,057
and then it's on its way to the packing plant.      

135
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,832
upon arrival, these raisins undergo extensive scrutiny.   

136

00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:52,197
they often store the raisins for weeks before further production.           

146
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,466
and during this time,      

147
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,936
the raisins stick together and form clumps.         

148
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,072
a revolving wheel with paddles  

149
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:04,877
now breaks up the clumps and separates the raisins.    

150
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,081
they tumble off the conveyer and onto a perforated shaker table.             

151
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:14,219
this separates any raisins which may still be clinging together.            

152
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,221
some cap stems remain.      

153
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,624
these bits link the grapes to the vine stems.        

154
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,560
the raisins now flow into cone-shaped machines    

155
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,696
that spin them to knock off the cap stems    

156
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:28,700
without damaging the raisins.  

157
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,236
once the raisins have been sorted by size,    

158
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,505
they travel under sprayers for a rinse,           

159
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:38,042
wash, and then another rinse.  

160
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,978
they cruise by a laser that detects           

161
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,114
any missed cap stems or plant material.        

162
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,651
a blast of air then gets rid of them.      

163
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:50,522
next, the raisins go into an inspection station    

164
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,124
and a worker picks out      

165
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:55,194
any material that may have been missed by the laser.       

166
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,931
with her approval, the raisins are ready for packaging.     

167
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,067
suctioning devices grab and unfold snack-sized boxes   

168
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,971
and place them, lid up, on a high-speed conveyer or.   

169
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,609
raisins spill into the open snack boxes,    

170
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,978
and it's all a blur.       

171
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,987
they fill 30,000 snack boxes an hour at this facility.    

172
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,829
it takes about a year to grow and dry these raisins      

173
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:35,033
and just minutes to package them.         

174
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,704
stored in a cool, dry place, they will last a year --     

175
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,806
unless someone eats them first.             

176
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:02,260
narrator: stereoscopic viewers date back to the 1840s.     

177
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,997
then, you had to manually insert one photograph at a time.    

178
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,134
in 1939, a new type of viewer was introduced          

179
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,403
which used a reel of slides instead of printed photographs.          

180
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,675
you advance from one to the next by pulling on a lever.      

181
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:24,550
early stereoscopic viewers gave              
people a way to see the world.  

182
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:28,953
when viewers with reels came out, travel remained the focus.             

183
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,622
you could visit a tourist site,              

184
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,492
then buy yourself a reel at the gift shop as a souvenir.            

185
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,695
today, 3-d viewers are also a business tool.    

186
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,030
companies use them as a creative way        

187
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,434
to market products or train employees.       

188
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,904
and consumers now buy them as a novelty or gift,      

189
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,373
going online to order custom reels      

190
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,511
featuring their personal photographs.   

191
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:55,580
whatever the purpose, it's all about the pictures.   

192
00:11:55,582 --> 00:12:00,118
the manufacturer can use photos             
shot with a 3-d digital camera  

193
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,688
or with a standard digital camera.    

194
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,330
the company's editor transfers the photographs to a computer  

195
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,466
and types a caption for each one.          

196
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,602
if the photos were taken with the regular camera,     

197
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,337
he performs some computer magic.             

198
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,208
he moves the image backwards, away from the viewer's eyes,   

199
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,210
then floats the text in the foreground        

200
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,011
closer to the viewer's eyes.   

201
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,212
this little trick        

202
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,749
makes the photo appear to be 3-dimensional.   

203
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,618
he puts two of each photo on a reel template.       

204
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,489
you view one with each eye and your brain combines the two,   

205
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,025
creating 3-dimensional depth.  

206
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:44,095
a photo and title in the center identify the reel.        

207
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,432
then the editor sends the assembled reel file     

208
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,368
to a photo processing lab    

209
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,706
and sets up the number of copies to be printed.          

210
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,308
the photo processor's lasers   

211
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,844
print the photographs pixel by pixel on polyester film.   

212
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,314
the machine prints a full sheet of 35 reels     

213
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,251
in exactly 1 minute and 14 seconds.     

214
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,852
then the sheet travels      

215
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,589
through a series        
of chemical baths and a dryer.  

216
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:14,459
and 11 1/2 minutes later, the film is ready.        

217
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:22,367
the editor carefully inspects every photo on every reel.    

218
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,472
if everything's perfect,     

219
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,075
he feeds the film through a laminator.       

220
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,010
the machine sandwiches the film              

221
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,612
between two sheets of transparent plastic      

222
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,482
then uses            
simultaneous pressure and heat  

223
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,617
to fuse everything together.   

224
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,486
encased in plastic,       

225
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:46,058
the floppy film is now rigid and three times thicker.     

226
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,697
they now feed the laminated film              

227
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,099
into a hydraulic punching machine.        

228
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,835
its cookie-cutter type dies   

229
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,904
slice the perimeter of the reels,          

230
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,439
releasing them from the sheet.  

231
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,255
the viewer itself is made up of injection-molded plastic.   

232
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,793
a worker secures the front part in an assembly fixture      

233
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,363
then places plastic lenses in the eyeholes.         

234
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:33,739
a machine then expands the plastic, locking in the lenses.             

235
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,742
preparing two viewers at a time now,          

236
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,211
he places a frosted plastic panel on the back part      

237
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,482
to diffuse the daylight or artificial light       

238
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,816
coming into the viewer.     

239
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,752
an inner eyepiece goes over the diffuser,     

240
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,490
then this machine applies heat to fuse it in place.       

241
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,496
next, the lever you pull down to advance from photo to photo.             

242
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:03,235
this spring returns it to the  
"up" position after each pull.  

243
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,039
now he mates the two parts of the viewer.   

244
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,308
a high-pressure air press    

245
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,845
squeezes them together in a permanent bond.       

246
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,114
the finishing touch -- a printing pad          

247
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,684
stamps the front of the viewer with the brand name.       

248
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,258
stereoscopic viewers have come a long way       

249
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,460
since their invention in the 1800s.          

250
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,062
while still offering a dose of nostalgia,       

251
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,663
there's a new twist --      

252
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,800
putting your very own photos on a reel as a unique gift    

253
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,438
or a fun way to relive those vacation memories.     

254
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,627
narrator: the ribbon microphone was invented in the 1920s    

255
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,498
and first commercially produced in 1931.             

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,567
it's called a ribbon microphone because inside,         

257
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,238
a thin aluminum ribbon     
positioned between two magnets  

258
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,775
converts sound waves into electrical signals.     

259
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,782
introduced in 1931, ribbon microphones revolutionized    

260
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:27,252
the broadcasting and audio recording industries    

261
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,988
with unprecedented sound quality.          

262
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,125
this company manufactures a modern version of the rca-44,             

263
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,995
one of the first ribbon microphones.       

264
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,931
this manufacturer handcrafts the microphone,         

265
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,868
starting with the frame, which holds all the components.           

266
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,403
after cutting a flat piece of brass,      

267
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,739
the machinist makes two bends with a press,  

268
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,409
then drills threaded holes for the fasteners        

269
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:56,647
that will connect the frame   
to the rest of the microphone.  

270
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,750
then he puts the bar into another press        

271
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,954
that bends the two ends upward to form a u-shape.        

272
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,757
the frame goes off to another department      

273
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,159
to be chrome-plated and polished.          

274
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,427
meanwhile,            

275
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,963
another machinist takes a sheet of perforated brass   

276
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,099
to begin forming the      
microphone's signature grille.  

277
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,436
he secures it to a die with two mounting plates.    

278
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,908
the die is the shape of one half of the multisided grille.    

279
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,043
he mounts it onto a fly press,  

280
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,446
a press operated by rotating a heavy counterweight.      

281
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,651
as that counterweight spins, the die descends into a forming mold              

282
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:36,120
that's also in the shape of half of the grille.      

283
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,590
a high-speed automated cutter trims the perimeter       

284
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,761
to make a neat, even edge all around.           

285
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,864
then the grille halves      

286
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,533
are sent off to be chrome-plated and polished.          

287
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,137
next, a technician assembles the motor,       

288
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,406
the heart of the microphone.   

289
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,809
first, he snaps on two strong magnets.       

290
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,210
the gap between them       

291
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,345
is where he'll later insert the key component --       

292
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,681
the thin aluminum ribbon     

293
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,550
which gives this type of microphone its name.     

294
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,420
after aligning the top of the motor with the bottom,  

295
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,888
he attaches the frame,      

296
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,289
which has since acquired a custom-made transformer,    

297
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,693
electrical terminals, and side brackets.        

298
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,029
now for the all-important ribbon.    

299
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,564
a technician crafts it      

300
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,367
from a hair-thin sheet of pure aluminum.        

301
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,737
it's so fragile, he has to handle it with tweezers.            

302
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,840
first, using the edge of a razor blade,        

303
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,442
he glues down the edges to a thin sheet of paper     

304
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,979
set on a glass cutting surface.            

305
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:40,452
then, he places a second sheet of paper on top         

306
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,254
and, with a razor blade, slices lengthwise,        

307
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:47,992
dividing it into 4 ribbons, each 2/10 of an inch wide.    

308
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,595
when sound waves pass through the microphone,   

309
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,531
they cause minute differences in air pressure         

310
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,534
between the front and the back of the ribbon inside.      

311
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,803
this causes the ribbon to move  

312
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,140
in response to the peaks    
and valleys of the sound wave.  

313
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,076
the technician corrugates    
the ribbon so that it responds  

314
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,479
to this minute air-pressure changes more accurately.     

315
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,682
he removes the protective papers             

316
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:14,219
and installs the ribbon in the motor, between the two magnets.            

317
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,953
in this position,        

318
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,623
the moving ribbon is a conductor in a magnetic field,       

319
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,958
generating a tiny current --   

320
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,626
an electrical replica of the sound wave        

321
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,830
that can recorded, amplified, or broadcasted.         

322
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,700
a technician tests the ribbon's tension       

323
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,970
to ensure it's neither too tight nor too loose.          

324
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,373
he hooks up the terminals to an audio signal generator   

325
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,109
and measures at what frequency the ribbon resonates.      

326
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,313
if necessary, he tunes the ribbon by adjusting its tension.            

327
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,316
he installs what's called a puff shield.   

328
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,118
it prevents puffs of air     

329
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,254
from stretching or tearing the delicate ribbon.       

330
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,457
a two-part metal housing     

331
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,459
will encase the lower part of the motor.          

332
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,060
however, before assembling it,  

333
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,596
a technician glues on an embossed medal medallion   

334
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:02,267
bearing the company's logo.   

335
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,002
then he takes the motor,     

336
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:07,072
which by now has acquired an output cable,         

337
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:11,142
stands it upside down, and assembles the housing around it.               

338
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,014
then he turns it right-side up  

339
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,417
and assembles the two halves of the grille.          

340
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,354
a sleek-looking chrome-plated band hides the joint.      

341
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,696
he fastens the microphone to a u-shaped stand called a yoke.              

342
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,631
on each side, there's a thumb nut,       

343
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,099
which you loosen to tilt the mic               

344
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,369
then tighten to lock the position.      

345
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,841
although newer technologies have emerged since,       

346
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,578
the classic ribbon microphone still remains a favorite     

347
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,381
of sound engineers around the world.        

348
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,726
if you have any comments about the show,
