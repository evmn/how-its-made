00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:54,520
    narrator: the sauna is a    
centuries-old finnish tradition.

4
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:59,324
  99% of finns sit in a sauna   
     at least once a week.      

5
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,928
most homes, apartment buildings,
   and even offices have one.   

6
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,063
     don't live in finland      

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,532
 but want to enjoy the benefits 
        of a home sauna?        

8
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,802
           no sweat.            

9
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,607
   this outdoor sauna is made   
 of premium canadian red cedar, 

10
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:21,213
which is aromatic and resistant 
            to mold.            

11
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,349
  first, they measure the wood  
       with a hydrometer        

12
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,019
  to ensure the humidity level  
         is below 12%.          

13
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,688
    if the wood is too moist,   

14
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,027
 it will shrink after assembly, 
leaving gaps between the planks.

15
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,629
    once they've determined     
    that the wood is stable,    

16
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,499
      they put the planks       
       through a molder.        

17
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,834
          the machine's         
    seven different toolheads   

18
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,303
         smooth the top         
      and bottom surfaces.      

19
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,707
 the machine also carves tongue 
        and groove edges        

20
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,110
that will tightly lock one plank
          to the next.          

21
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,847
    the assemblers build the    
barrel-shaped sauna in sections.

22
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,584
        for the bottom,         
they start with a central plank 

23
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,919
that has a tongue on both sides.

24
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,460
     the tongues and grooves    
          fit together          

25
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,130
to render the joints watertight.

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,534
         the assemblers         
     continue adding planks     

27
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:20,004
      until there are eight     
on each side of the central one.

28
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,109
 they construct the sauna's back
 wall using the same technique. 

29
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,882
  once they've joined together  
 the required number of planks, 

30
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,417
          they lay down         
       a circular template      

31
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,820
   and secure it with clamps.   

32
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,964
      then they cut around      
  the template with a router.   

33
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,379
  to further secure the planks  
         to each other,         

34
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,516
    they drill angled holes     
    through adjacent ones...    

35
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,921
    ...and drive in screws.     

36
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:15,793
    they also screw in three    
horizontal reinforcement planks.

37
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,795
   using a pattern as a guide,  

38
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,199
     they cut out a window      
        with the router.        

39
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,537
   they screw window moldings   
      around the opening.       

40
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,944
 they apply an adhesive-backed  
    rubber insulation strip     

41
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,614
      along the perimeter.      

42
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,215
this will prevent heat and water

43
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,152
        from leaking out        
between the walls of the sauna. 

44
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,663
 they mount the front and back  
 walls onto the bottom section. 

45
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,908
 they add planks to both sides  
     of the bottom section      

46
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,111
     to gradually build up      
     the curved side walls.     

47
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,120
 the side walls meet at the top 

48
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,156
         on either side         
       of a central plank       

49
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,860
   that's pre-wired with the    
 sauna's l.e.d. ceiling lights. 

50
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,068
          workers strap         
  three galvanized-steel cables 

51
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,271
       around the sides...      

52
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,408
          and pull them         
     to a specific tension.     

53
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,382
      these cables further      
 bind the planks to each other. 

54
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,688
    the structural assembly     
        is now complete.        

55
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,758
     they begin installing      
    the interior components,    

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,961
  starting with a thermometer   
        and hydrometer.         

57
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,432
             next,              
  they mount a pivoting cover   

58
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,201
 over the fresh-air-vent holes. 

59
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,704
       this allows users        
      to block outside air      

60
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,040
        or allow it in.         

61
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,843
   then they add an hourglass   
 that counts down 15 minutes -- 

62
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,913
      the recommended time      
      to spend in a sauna.      

63
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,982
 next comes the electric stove. 

64
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,519
   it contains volcanic rocks   
that absorb and store the heat. 

65
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,589
 you have the option of pouring 
    water onto the hot rocks    

66
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,258
        to create steam.        

67
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,799
  after installing benches and  
 a water-absorbent rubber floor,

68
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,133
      they hang the door.       

69
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,669
   the glass in both the door   
         and rear window        

70
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,670
     is tinted for privacy.     

71
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,875
the sauna reaches a temperature 
        of 185 degrees.         

72
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,610
  the barrel shape of the sauna 

73
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,747
   optimizes the circulation    
     of the heat and steam.     

74
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,556
   narrator: a wheelchair lift  
         is an elevator         

75
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,359
        designed to carry       
        wheelchair users        

76
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:03,161
           up and down          
     a multistory building.     

77
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:07,499
      it can be installed       
    both inside and outside.    

78
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,301
     a lift makes a building    
           accessible           

79
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:12,270
            to anyone           
 for whom stairs are a barrier. 

80
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,445
        a wheelchair lift       
        can be installed        

81
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:24,182
   in virtually any building    
        or private home.        

82
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,051
        all that's needed       
  is sufficient vertical space  

83
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,489
    and compliance with local   
  elevator and building codes.  

84
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,593
        a hydraulic lift        
    moves the passenger cab     

85
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,195
       on a rail system.        

86
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,529
    the motor and mechanisms    

87
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:43,201
         are concealed          
  in an attached metal tower.   

88
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,470
   the structure of the walls   
      surrounding the lift      

89
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,938
      are made of aluminum,     

90
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,742
 which arrive from the supplier 
        in long pieces.         

91
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,545
  workers here at the factory   
cut them to the required length.

92
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,417
 they shape the corners and cut 
the slots required for assembly.

93
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,901
      to make each section      
          of the wall,          

94
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:19,171
     they join four pieces      
     to construct a frame.      

95
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,376
       once the frames for      
all the wall sections are ready,

96
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,577
      workers assemble them     

97
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,713
     to make sure the pieces    
     fit together correctly.    

98
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,251
            they make           
   any necessary adjustments,   

99
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,022
  then take the wall sections   
  apart to insert the panels.   

100
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,527
         the wall panels        
 are made of aluminum, acrylic, 

101
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,729
       or tempered glass.       

102
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,197
     workers first lay down     

103
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,402
 a foam spacer strip to prevent 
    the panel from rattling.    

104
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,670
   then they secure the panel   
          to the frame          

105
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,941
 with snap-in aluminum molding. 

106
00:07:55,943 --> 00:08:00,812
  from here, the wall sections  
  go to the packing department. 

107
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,814
  now it's time for the lift's  
       mechanical system.       

108
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,151
in between the steel side rails,

109
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,288
  workers mount three u-shaped  
    supports and a cylinder.    

110
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,156
        these will hold         
     the hydraulic piston,      

111
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,958
   which expands and retracts   

112
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,895
    to move the passenger cab   
          up and down.          

113
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,964
  workers verify the position   
    of the support brackets     

114
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,233
    and secure them in place.   

115
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,637
  then they install the piston  
       into the cylinder        

116
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,440
  and onto the three supports.  

117
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:33,912
 the piston is locked in place  
   with thick steel brackets.   

118
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,647
  they install the controller,  

119
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,850
      the wheelchair lift's     
          brain center.         

120
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,718
         the controller         
      regulates everything,     

121
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,988
    from the passenger cab's    
            movement            

122
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,057
      to the safety sensors     
         and door locks.        

123
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,726
    workers install the pump.   

124
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:51,596
   it pushes hydraulic fluid    
into the piston to move the cab.

125
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,133
    they take the power cord    

126
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,402
       from both the pump       
         and controller         

127
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,171
        and hook them up        
 to their respective terminals. 

128
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,280
   then they connect the hose   
    for the hydraulic fluid.    

129
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:12,083
        it runs from pump       
to the piston via this manifold.

130
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,285
the manifold has a shutoff valve

131
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,687
   so maintenance technicians   
       can safely disable       

132
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,958
       the wheelchair lift      
         for servicing.         

133
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,695
    workers test then connect   
      the landing switches.     

134
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,164
      the lift installers       
    will use these switches     

135
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,434
   to set the travel distance   
        between stories.        

136
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,236
 this ensures the passenger cab 

137
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:35,106
 will stop level with the floor 
        at each landing.        

138
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,843
the cab sits on a steel platform
        called a sling.         

139
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:43,181
 a worker now screws the sling's
 left side to the left skate -- 

140
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:47,252
 a four-wheel trolley that runs 
    on the lift's left rail.    

141
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,721
        he does the same        
      with the right side.      

142
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,525
       the skates connect       
 to this heavy-duty drive chain 

143
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,863
     that turns on a roller     
    at the top of the piston.   

144
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,465
     for the cab to ascend,     

145
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,401
the pump pushes hydraulic fluid 
        into the piston.        

146
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,338
 the piston expands and pushes  
      on the drive chain,       

147
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,774
 moving the skates up the rails.

148
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,012
          when you push         
      the "descend" button,     

149
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,346
         a valve opens,         

150
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,816
    allowing hydraulic fluid    
       to exit the piston.      

151
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,018
        aided by gravity,       

152
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,022
   the cab gradually descends.  

153
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,690
  they test the operation panel 

154
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,826
      they'll later install     
           in the cab.          

155
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,961
         they make sure         
      all the buttons work      

156
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,897
       and move the sling       
     up and down correctly.     

157
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,102
  workers also test the safety  
brakes installed in the skates. 

158
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,304
       if the drive chain       
       ever loses tension,      

159
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,706
           the brakes           
  automatically block the rails 

160
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,942
to prevent the cab from falling.

161
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,647
  installers assemble the cab   
            on-site             

162
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,982
    and mount it on the sling   

163
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,184
        that will move it       
      from floor to floor.      

164
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,862
            narrator:           
    a diorama is a 3-d scene    

165
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,732
      that offers a glimpse     
    of another place or time.   

166
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,601
         it is believed         
      to have been invented     

167
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:14,138
 by a french theatrical designer
            in 1822.            

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,340
         despite modern         
       digital technology,      

169
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,745
  the diorama continues to be a 
great way to create an illusion.

170
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,954
     this is an art exhibit     
 created by one diorama artist. 

171
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:34,625
     this particular series     
depicts an apocalyptic scenario.

172
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,629
    the images are powerful     
         and authentic.         

173
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,834
         it all starts          
 with some background research. 

174
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,169
    the artist and assistant    

175
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,505
          decide on a           
chinese-takeout-restaurant scene

176
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,176
and take pictures for reference.

177
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:55,046
 back in the studio, the artist 
 checks the scale of components 

178
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,648
         to be featured         
     in the diorama scene,      

179
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,984
          like a fox.           

180
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,253
  to make the scene look real,  

181
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:07,458
 the size of the fox must be in 
 proportion to everything else. 

182
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,794
 she decides that it will work. 

183
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
      but the toy scooter       
         is too small,          

184
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,071
   so she produces a template   
        that's to scale.        

185
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,874
   her assistant then pencils   
   an outline of the template   

186
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,142
   onto a piece of rigid foam   

187
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,745
        to make a version       
         of the scooter         

188
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,546
    that's the correct size.    

189
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,618
    she carves out the shape    
        using a hot wire.       

190
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,753
       it melts the foam        
       for a cleaner cut        

191
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,022
     than could be achieved     
         with a knife.          

192
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,561
       the piece of foam        
  now has scooter-like curves,  

193
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,597
    but it's far too chunky.    

194
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,835
      she whittles it down      
     using a utility knife.     

195
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,577
       she sands the foam       
     to refine the carving.     

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,552
a paint job and a set of wheels 
  complete the transformation.  

197
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,323
next, she copies newspaper pages

198
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,526
     and shrinks them down      
     to the correct scale.      

199
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:20,665
      she cuts the borders      
  and gathers them in a pile.   

200
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,002
 she brushes thinned latex paint
          on the pages.         

201
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:28,540
  this gives them the yellowed  
  appearance of old newspapers. 

202
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,976
  she crumples and un-crumples  
    the pages for an effect     

203
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,179
 that also makes them look old. 

204
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,954
  she cuts out images of many   
 chinese-food takeout cartons.  

205
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,156
      they've been printed      
        onto paperboard         

206
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,492
    and include crease lines    
          for folding.          

207
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,831
        folding a carton        
    is a kind of origami --     

208
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,367
 the japanese art of folding -- 

209
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,769
and it's a bit more challenging 
      on such a miniature       

210
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,073
             scale,             
  but practice makes perfect.   

211
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,445
        she applies glue        
      to the folded flaps       

212
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,514
   and presses them together.   

213
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,755
 clamps hold the seams in place 
     until the glue dries.      

214
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,728
           to create            
 a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, 

215
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,463
     they'll scatter leaves     
     throughout the diorama.    

216
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,266
the assistant now selects leaves

217
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,335
     that have been pressed     
        for about a week        

218
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,937
    and can still be handled    
       without breaking.        

219
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,808
she punches out mini leaf shapes
   with a handy crafting tool   

220
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,911
     and accumulates piles      
       in various colors.       

221
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,286
      because it's punched      
      from actual leaves,       

222
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,290
     the miniature foliage      
     looks very authentic.      

223
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,367
     next, she works a lump     
        of polymer clay         

224
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,503
  until it's soft and narrow.   

225
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:12,310
      she inserts the clay      
        into an extruder        

226
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,246
         and presses it         
through perforations at the end.

227
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,850
      this creates strands      
             of clay            

228
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,654
         that look like         
      tiny lo mein noodles.     

229
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,095
     she arranges the clay      
     on a tiny paper plate.     

230
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,068
  she then brushes brown paint  
        onto the noodles        

231
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,937
       to imitate sauce.        

232
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,476
      she rolls green clay      
        into long strands       

233
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,047
    and chops it up to mimic    
    the look of green onions.   

234
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,319
       these small touches      
       make a difference.       

235
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,457
  the creation of the diorama   
  continues after this break.   

236
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,034
            narrator:           
    a diorama is an art form    

237
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,037
   that is all about thinking   
        inside the box.         

238
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,573
  an artist builds a 3-d scene  
    within a boxy structure.    

239
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,843
        it has one side         
       open for viewing.        

240
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,913
 the scene can be true to life  
or inspired by a place or event,

241
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,515
    and sometimes, a diorama    

242
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,118
       can change the way       
      we look at the world.     

243
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,524
      the clay mini meals       
       are now complete,        

244
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,495
    and the artist uses them    
  to create a fake menu sign.   

245
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,634
   she snaps pictures of each   
of the chinese-food selections. 

246
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,441
          the choices           
   include sesame chicken...    

247
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,547
 ...fried and steamed dumplings,

248
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:01,685
    and a new york favorite,    
    chicken wings with fries.   

249
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,821
            printed             
   onto translucent plastic,    

250
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,025
      the clay imitations       
   look quite mouthwatering.    

251
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,566
 she brushes thinned white paint
      onto the photographs      

252
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,869
 to create a cloudy residue...  

253
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,843
 ...and adds streaks of thinned 
  brown paint to the menu sign  

254
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,380
    to mimic dust particles.    

255
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:35,453
now she builds the diorama walls
       using foam sheets.       

256
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:38,723
   she glues mirrored plastic   
      panels to one wall.       

257
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,527
   the reflections will make    
this diorama seem more spacious.

258
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,865
      she hot-glues a sign      
         to the mirror.         

259
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,733
    it outlines the correct     
           procedure            

260
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,604
    in a choking emergency.     

261
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:57,175
   she tapes the corners with   
 little strips of masking tape. 

262
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:04,215
she then rubs ground-up volcanic
      ash onto the mirror.      

263
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:08,952
  the ash clings to the surface 
  and emulates grease buildup.  

264
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:12,256
       it will also make        
 the mirror's reflections hazy. 

265
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,362
    after careful measuring,    

266
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,065
       she cuts out a door      
        from polystyrene        

267
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,966
   and spray-paints it silver.  

268
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,436
     she assembles the door     
       to the back wall,        

269
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,574
  but first installs lighting   
above the doorway and tests it. 

270
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,711
   with the lights installed,   

271
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,381
 she glues the translucent menu 
     sign to the framework.     

272
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:48,593
 switched on, these backlights  
  illuminate the menu choices.  

273
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,133
  the artist and her assistant  
attach the walls of the diorama 

274
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,603
 to a tile-patterned foam floor.

275
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,909
      they tape the walls       
    together from the back.     

276
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,716
  they scatter grass and dirt   
     throughout the scene.      

277
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:20,124
     this represents nature     
taking over after an apocalypse.

278
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,028
    an overturned trash can     

279
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,632
    and yellowed newspapers     
          on the floor          

280
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,401
   imply the sudden departure   
           of humans.           

281
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,974
     they decide the scene      
   needs more grass and dirt,   

282
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,645
       so they distribute       
     more across the floor.     

283
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,648
  they now place the motorbike  
        into the scene.         

284
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,050
    empty takeout containers    

285
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,986
       and a plastic fox        
      in the open doorway       

286
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,957
add to the illusion of an urban 
 landscape returning to nature. 

287
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,195
    they add the third wall     

288
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,731
        and the ceiling         
 with its fluorescent lighting. 

289
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,604
    the scene has been set,     

290
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:11,475
   and now the artist focuses   
   an 8x10 film camera on it.   

291
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:16,547
 this large-format camera will  
produce a high-resolution image.

292
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,619
    she adjusts the lighting    
      and, when satisfied,      

293
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,487
       takes three shots.       

294
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,630
             this is            
    a carefully crafted scene   

295
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,599
viewed through the camera's eye.

296
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,540
the team has even built and shot
   a diorama of their studio.   

297
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,515
         ordinary spaces        
      become extraordinary      

298
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:56,787
   when recreated in a diorama  
        and photographed.       

299
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,992
many scenes, when printed large,
      appear true to life.      

300
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,073
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,        

301
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,809
   or if you'd like to suggest  
    topics for future shows,
