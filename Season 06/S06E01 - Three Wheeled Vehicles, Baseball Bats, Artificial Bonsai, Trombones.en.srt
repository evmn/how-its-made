3
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,522
it's common for pressure to build up          

4
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,124
inside chemical tanker trucks during transport.       

5

pressure relief vents are standard equipment     

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,845
on chemical tanker trucks.   

11
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,749
they ensure tanks can hold up 

12
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,553
to the pressures inherent to this industry.  

13
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:32,891
production starts with a bin of wax pellets.        

14
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,028
they use pellets to make models
of the vent's parts      

15
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,231
in a process called lost-wax casting.    

16
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,835
pellets are fed into an injection machine.   

17
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,539
the wax melts into a mold of the vent's lower housing.  

18
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,916
four wax models are fused to a single wax tree stand.  

19
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,386
the tree stand is left to cure for a couple of hours.     

20
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,123
once cured, a worker dips the wax tree       

21
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,658
into a slurry of ceramic.   

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,860
he removes the stand of wax models,         

23
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,164
then twirls it to drain any excess ceramic.      

24
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:23,075
this is the first of several ceramic coatings.  

25
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,944
between coatings, he applies silica sand     

26
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,547
to the wet ceramic.      

27

the sand rains down onto the ceramic,     

28
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,951
creating a stucco effect.   

29
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,891
the first layer of stucco is finally granulated.     

30
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,494
the next few layers will be coarse.        

31
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,233
by building up progressively coarser layers of stucco,   

32
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,235
he creates a ceramic shell   

33
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,871
with the desired thickness and strength.         

34

workers pour hot, liquid steel into the hollow tree.     

43
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,948
they add a chemical sealer, then top the molten metal   

44
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,984
with a piece of ceramic-fiber insulation.  

45

to precise specifications.   

53
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,598
after cleaning and polishing, the part is complete.     

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
it's time for assembly.    

55
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,270
the worker starts with the top of the pressure vent.     

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:37,142
a large spring is inserted to aid pressure relief.    

57
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,478
a metal plate is added to seal the top of the vent  

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,080
to the lower part.       

59
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:46,351
the lower vent housing is then seated on the metal plate.   

60
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,421
he moves the assembly under a hydraulic ram.     

61
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,690
the ram presses the lower housing,       

62
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,893
the sealer plate, and the spring
to a specific tension.     

63
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:00,431
he then screws the lower housing
to the top of the vent.    

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,901
a metal ring inscribed with the vent's model     

65
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,203
and flow rate is attached at the top.

this chemical tank pressure vent
is now ready for testing.   

67
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,886
the technician screws it to the test stand.       

68
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,855
he activates a system     

69
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,792
that forces compressed air into the vent.         

70
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:31,062
this confirms whether the vent works at the desired setting. 

71
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,465
once approved, he attaches a cover

this factory makes one flavor at a time.           

88
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,657
the first step is to add food coloring    

89
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,461
and flavoring to pulverized sugar.      

90
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,662
this pink color        

91
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,565
and mint flavoring produces a wintergreen taste. 

92
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,003
corn syrup comes next,     

93
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,605
along with a binding solution of vegetable gums       

94
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,409
and gelatin dissolved in water.

95
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,411
after mixing for about 8 minutes,      

96
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,415
the candy dough's consistency is checked.    

97
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,418
if it isn't thick, elastic, or sticky enough,   

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,222
more binding solution is added until the dough is just right. 

99
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,827
workers divide the dough into chunks,          

100
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,829
then feed them into a dough shooter.     

101
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,899
this is the first station on the wafer-forming line.   

102
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,635
the black dough is licorice flavor.      

103
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,437
a conveyor returns leftover dough     

104
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,504
from the end of the line    

105
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,340
to be reused for making new wafers.     

106
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,579
they're pushed through a slot, forming the dough sheet    

107
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,583
that's 20 inches wide by about an inch thick.    

108
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,619
this yellow dough is lemon flavored.       

109
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,727
a steady sprinkle of cornstarch

110
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,798
prevents the sheet from sticking to the equipment.

111
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,334
rollers compress and stretch the dough forward, 

112
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:53,338
flattening the sheet to an inch thick.       

113
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,473
the next station stamps    

114
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,609
on the company logo, then cuts out the wafers.   

115
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:02,346
the cutter moves up and down 180 times per minute.     

116
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,016
the wafers fall through a gap 

117
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,419
to a moving conveyor belt below.

118
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,758
the conveyor belt moves the wafers        

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,927
to a multilevel tunnel dryer. 

120
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,433
they pass through the dryer  

121
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,237
13 times over the course of an hour.  

122
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,447
these green wafers are lime flavored.       

123
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:39,584
the dryer temperature     
is about 150 degrees fahrenheit,

124
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,586
warm enough to remove half of the moisture      

125
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,656
without melting the sugar.   

126
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,659
these brown wafers are chocolate flavor.     

127
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,728
once out of the dryer, the wafers           

128
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,464
pile up in trays without sticking.       

129
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,069
workers stack the trays in a drying room.       

130
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,673
it's heated and humidified with steam.   

131
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,276
the candy wafers stay here until their moisture level   

132
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,947
drops to between 0.75% and 1%. 

133
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,286
the factory tests a few samples

134
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,888
using a device called a penetrometer.     

135
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,958
it measures the force required to penetrate the candy wafer  

136
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,294
to the point of breaking it.  

137
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:28,300
this ensures the candies are the correct consistency.  

138
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,969
when the trays come out of the drying room,    

139
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,040
workers send the candies to the packaging line.     

140
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,909
the colors are mixed together, 

141
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,714
ensuring every roll of candy has
a random assortment of flavors.

142
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,918
the wafers flow into channels, 

143
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,087
which stand them on their sides.

144
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,592
workers grab about two rolls' worth,    

145
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,727
then fill two channels of a feeder          

146
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,997
that takes them to the wrapping station.    

147
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,801
another worker fills in the gaps,       

148
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,538
ensuring each roll has 38 pieces.         

149
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,808
the wrapping machine cuts printed,         

150
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,609
translucent paper wrapping   

151
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,546
and applies a bead of glue to one edge.          

152
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,483
in a matter of seconds, the machine lifts the roll   

153
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,819
into the wrapper, seals the edges,        

154
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,287
and twists the ends closed.  

155
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,757
as the sealed rolls move on a conveyor belt,      

156
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,228
heated blocks iron the twisted ends flat.     

157
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,031
each candy wafer roll weighs 2 ounces.        

158
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,233
workers pack 24 rolls per retail box,        

159
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,937
then pack the boxes in shipping cases.       

160
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,976
in addition to a traditional roll with assorted flavors,  

161
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,979
the factory also produces chocolate-only rolls. 

162
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,581
production has modernized over the years,        

163
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,051
but the recipe itself hasn't changed much   

164
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,785
since the first candy wafer  

165
00:10:54,787 --> 00:11:03,394
rolled off the production line in 1847.  

166
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,597
the modern food truck is a mobile restaurant     

167
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,400
with a full kitchen inside.  

168
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,801
food is cooked fresh      

169
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,370
and sold to customers through a service window.   

170
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,544
most food trucks are standard panel trucks.   

171
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,281
their cargo area is a fully equipped commercial kitchen  

172
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,650
with a service window on one side.          

173
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,890
they're usually customized by boutique companies,     

174
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,493
so there's no standard method. 

175
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,230
however, certain modifications to the panel trucks are common,

176
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,833
like enhancing the truck's suspension system 

177
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,835
or reinforcing the flooring and walls     

178
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,171
to support the kitchen's weight.

179
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,973
the lighten the load, this company          

180
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,176
builds the kitchen's structural components     

181
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,379
out of aluminum bars rather than heavy steel.    

182
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,983
once the pieces are cut,    

183
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,087
a worker assembles, then welds them together.   

184
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,760
this structure will support a stainless-steel countertop. 

185
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,269
workers cut the countertops and cabinets          

186
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,638
from thick sheets of stainless steel.      

187
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,813
they bend the sheets using a machine called a press break.

188
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,086
for this countertop,      

189
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,423
they bend a 90-degree angle on the front end        

190
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,659
to form a 1.5-inch square edge.

191
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,030
to construct walls and ceilings,

192
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,833
they rivet thin sheets of stainless steel or aluminum 

193
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,602
to panels of wood.       

194
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,507
fire-retardant plywood is used for the kitchens.   

195
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,579
the boards are installed over styrofoam insulation.   

196
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,116
they leave the truck's aluminum floor as is.     

197
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,719
once the walls, ceiling, and flooring are complete,   

198
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,756
it's time to install the    
kitchen's cabinets and counters.

199
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,127
workers screw each counter support      

200
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,529
to the wooden structure of the wall,          

201
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,466
then fasten the countertop with rivets.          

202
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,009
they peel off the film     

203
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,878
that was protecting the stainless-steel surface.  

204
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:39,216
next, they install the major appliances,     

205
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,152
which include a commercial refrigerator,   

206
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,454
freezer, and cooking equipment.

207
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,893
then the electrical box is installed.         

208
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,028
they connect wiring for the outlets,        

209
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,230
lighting, water heater, water pump,          

210
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,233
and air-conditioning system.  

211
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,643
the generator is installed underneath the nearest counter.

212
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,713
it supplies the truck with electricity.       

213
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,917
next to the electrical box is the power-transfer box.    

214
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,385
it contains a switch      

215
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:17,655
that enables the truck to use an outdoor power source.

216
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,524
the switches for the interior and exterior lighting     

217
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,827
are underneath the electrical box.    

218
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,401
workers install the light fixtures,      

219
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,271
cabinetry, sink, and serving window.      

220
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,610
they also install the gas lines

221
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,881
that power the commercial cooking equipment.       

222
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,017
this truck has several gas appliances --   

223
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,887
a six-burner gas range with large oven,        

224
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,758
a deep fryer, a charcoal grill,
and a flattop cooking surface. 

225
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,363
the kitchen is equipped with a ventilation hood    

226
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,031
over the cooking area.     

227
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,367
its powerful fan gathers smoke 

228
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,171
and sends it out a vent on top of the truck.      

229
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,074
it's time to outfit the exterior.    

230
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,981
some food trucks are painted, but most use graphics     

231
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,617
that are digitally printed on adhesive vinyl.       

232
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,791
after positioning each panel of the design,         

233
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,927
they apply heat with a torch. 

234
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,662
this removes trapped air,   

235
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,065
stretching the vinyl over rivets
and other protrusions.     

236
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,943
this mobile eatery is ready to roll with a kitchen

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,747
that meets fire-code and food-service regulations. 

238
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,551
it may not provide the ambiance
of a sit-down restaurant,   

239
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:59,357
but when a food truck pulls up,
you never need a reservation. 

240
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,199
but there's still a market for traditional twine.     

241
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,435
they have their own unique strengths,       

242
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,872
and that's why we are still bound by their ties.      

243
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,113
woven from manila, sisal, or flax fibers,        

244
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:27,118
traditional ropes are a binding element in our world.

245
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,652
they're easier to grip     

246
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,124
and stretch less than synthetics.     

247
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,126
at this deep and narrow building,      

248
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,261
they've been twisting fibers into rope   

249
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,730
for more than two centuries.  

250
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,800
they're still producing rope the old-fashioned way.     

251
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:47,471
the process starts with racks of natural-fiber yarns.    

252
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,007
the yarns are funneled through separators,      

253
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,877
which configure them to twist evenly together.   

254
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,146
the fibers then travel through tubes   

255
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,282
that squeeze them into bundles.

256
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,951
workers tie the ends of the bundles         

257
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:04,689
onto a wheeled vehicle called the forming machine.  

258
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,157
they roll the machine back   

259
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,559
until there's no slack in the bundles.        

260
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,764
the machine is then sent to the opposite end      

261
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:16,100
of the factory, over 1,000 feet away.     

262
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,705
as the machine travels backwards, its gears  

263
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,978
turn hooks, twisting the yarns into a tight configuration.  

264
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,446
the formation of the twists  

265
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,647
ensure an even distribution of tension.          

266
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:35,319
this is what makes rope so strong.           

267
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,656
this long, indoor space is called a ropewalk.     

268
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,259
there aren't many of them left in the world.       

269
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,665
halfway down, a worker places a trestle   

270
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,601
underneath the twisting yarns. 

271
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:55,540
this keeps them off the floor and prevents tangling.     

272
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,676
when the machine        
reaches the back wall, it stops,

273
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,146
and workers cut both ends of the strands.        

274
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,150
they tie them to posts     

275
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,220
to maintain tension and prevent unraveling.    

276
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,427
the twisted fibers stretch   

277
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,996
from one end of the building to the other.         

278
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,970
on one side, they tie three of the strands 

279
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,240
to a machine that will transform them into a rope.  

280
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,581
halfway down, they bring in a cart      

281
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,518
that holds a piece of grooved wood known as a top.

282
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,190
they tuck the twisted strands into the grooves of the top.  

283
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,062
they then roll the cart    

284
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:56,133
down to face the rope-making machine.    

285
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,604
a worker ties rope around the strands in the top. 

286
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,941
this holds them in place as the rope-making machine   

287
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:09,146
twists the three strands into one.           

288
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,651
the cart rolls along rails propelled by twisting action. 

289
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,959
it leaves newly formed rope in its wake.          

290
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,095
the rope machine with twisting hooks      

291
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,697
remains in the same place.   

292
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,968
when the cart arrives at the opposite side      

293
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,372
of the building, the rope is formed.      

294
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,574
a worker removes the ties around the top.    

295
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,910
they now have a piece of rope 

296
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,911
that's over 700 feet long   

297
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,581
and almost 5 inches in diameter.

298
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,588
they slice the rope at both ends.         

299
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,060
then they wind it onto a big spool,       

300
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,864
packing it into a tight coil. 

301
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,701
this traditional rope is almost ready to be shipped. 

302
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,339
the customer requested looped ends     

303
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:12,543
for securing the rope with a shackle.        

304
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,213
so, the rope-maker unravels the ends       

305
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:20,017
and pierces the rope      
with a hollow tool called a fid.

306
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,952
he makes a loop        

307
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,889
and slides the unraveled strands
through the fid.        

308
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,426
he finishes the job by weaving the strands     

309
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,228
into the rope.         

310
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,367
they're ready to test a segment of the rope.     

311
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,970
two hydraulic jaws pull it until it breaks.    

312
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,976
the rope must be able to handle 55 tons of force.  

313
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,650
traditional ropes have the strength to carry on,   

314
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,952
as they have done for a very long time.
