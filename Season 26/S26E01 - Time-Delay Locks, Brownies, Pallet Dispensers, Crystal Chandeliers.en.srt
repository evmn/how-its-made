   discovery communications

00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,519
           narrator:            
   many banks and businesses    

4
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,654
     have time-delay locks      
        on their safes          

5
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:59,458
    to keep their valuables     
     and documents secure.      

6
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,927
     this helps deter theft     
        because robbers         

7
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,197
  may not want to wait around   
     for the safe to open.      

8
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,267
   if they do, the time delay   
    may keep them around long   
             enough             

9
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,770
 for police to make an arrest.  

10
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:18,344
    this lock lets you select   
             delays             
 ranging from 1 to 30 minutes.  

11
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:24,417
        the timer starts        
   after you insert the key.    

12
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:27,620
 most of the lock's components  
       are made of zinc.        

13
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,488
      this semi-automated       
        casting machine         

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,492
        heats zinc bars         
     to about 800 degrees.      

15
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,696
  the molten metal is then fed  
   into an injection system,    

16
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:40,433
     which shoots the zinc      
   into a part-shaped mold.     

17
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,835
   the machine automatically    
     refills the zinc bars      

18
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,703
     as the metal is used.      

19
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:49,842
 as soon as the machine injects 
  molten zinc into the mold,    

20
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,910
       surrounding tubes        
       spray cold water         

21
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,313
        to quickly cool         
    and solidify the metal.     

22
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,784
      then the mold opens       
     and ejects the part.       

23
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,855
  the parts have rough edges,   
   so they go into a vibrating  
              tub.              

24
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:07,259
    inside, they run against    
             ceramic            
     stones and an abrasive     
            compound            

25
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,596
      to smooth the edges       
    and polish the surface.     

26
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:18,004
     the parts are cleaned      
   and painted on one side.     

27
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,207
   then they go into an oven    
     to bake on the paint.      

28
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,610
      the lock's main cam       

29
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,680
      sets the time delay       
    and the open window --      

30
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:32,084
   the amount of time before    
     the safe automatically     
            relocks.            

31
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,822
  here, they're drilling holes  
          for screws,           

32
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,024
     which will regulate the    
            lengths             

33
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,427
       of the time delay        
     and the open window.       

34
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:46,499
   once the lock's components   
are prepared, assembly begins.  

35
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:49,034
     workers insert the lock    
            cylinder            
        into its shell          

36
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,170
      and remove the key.       

37
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,172
        then they screw         
   on a steel cylinder cam.     

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,108
     when you turn the key      
       in the cylinder,         

39
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,377
          a cam winds           
     and starts the timer.      

40
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,514
   after the set time delay,    

41
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,884
     the cam pulls a lever      
    that releases the lock's    
             latch.             

42
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,455
      to build the lock's       
       timing assembly,         

43
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:14,459
   they first attach a spring   
      to the timer plate.       

44
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,262
 they hold the spring in place  
   with a plastic retainer.     

45
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,600
       then they install        
      a brass timer cam.        

46
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:25,337
      the spring holds it       
    in the locked position.     

47
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,740
  a pin on the cylinder cam's   
 lever sits on the timer cam.   

48
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:34,480
  when the time delay is over,  
               the              
pin releases the timer spring,  

49
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,682
       and the timer cam        
      moves to the unlocked     
           position.            

50
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,885
 this allows the cylinder cam   

51
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,521
      to retract the latch      
      and open the lock.        

52
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,161
      they screw the plate      
 with the spring and timer cam  

53
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,563
         to the timer,          

54
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,566
      which is gear-driven      
   like a mechanical clock.     

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,176
       they let the timer       
     run down all the way.      

56
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,046
   then they turn the spring    
          four times.           

57
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,050
   they mount the main cam,     

58
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,053
   which sets the time delay    
        and open window         

59
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,956
   on top of the timer cam.     

60
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,596
   now they begin calibrating   
          the timer.            

61
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,864
       first they install       
  an aluminum weight assembly   

62
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,900
that controls the timer speed.  

63
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,340
       they run the timer       
     on a testing machine,      

64
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,475
   comparing it to the delay    
     set on the main cam.       

65
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,078
  if the timer runs too fast,   

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
     they take some tension     
     off the timer spring.      

67
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,082
 if the timer runs too slowly,  

68
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,818
         they trim down         
      the weight assembly       

69
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,686
    until they get the right    
             speed.             

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:54,093
   once the timer is accurate,  
              they              
screw it into the timer cover.  

71
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:01,500
   the lock body contains the   
              lever             
    that retracts the lock's    
             latch.             

72
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,702
          it also has           
    a brass electrical plug     

73
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,172
           to connect           
 a time-delay indicator light.  

74
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,108
    after securing the latch    
     and lever in position      

75
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,045
      with a cover plate,       
     they install the timer     
           assembly.            

76
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,915
        the visible side        
       is painted black,        

77
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,784
   just like the visible side   
      of the cover plate.       

78
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:24,056
        then they insert        
    the cylinder assembly.      

79
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,261
      they mount the lock       
    on the door of the safe     

80
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,263
          and hook up           
     the indicator lights,      

81
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,833
           which run            
   on double-"a" batteries.     

82
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:46,077
 to open the safe, you insert,  
  turn, then remove the key.    

83
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,481
    the red light indicates     
  the timer is counting down.   

84
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:53,152
  when the time delay is over,  
   the green light comes on.    

85
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:56,589
   then you reinsert the key,   
      and the safe opens.       

86
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,104
  narrator: chocolate brownies  
       are irresistible.        

87
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,973
 their origins are uncertain,   

88
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,507
         but they were          
     definitely developed       

89
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,710
      in the united states      
      over a century ago.       

90
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,712
 one story is that a homemaker  
      from bangor, maine,       

91
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,848
    made the first brownies     
         accidentally           

92
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,583
 while trying to make a cake.   

93
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,719
   another story states that    
     they were deliberately     
            invented            

94
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,821
    by the chef at a chicago    
             hotel.             

95
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:35,461
   neither cake nor cookie, a   
     brownie is something in    
            between,            

96
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,396
        a moist, dense,         
       and chewy square.        

97
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:43,068
   there's no doubt it brings   
    something special to the    
             table.             

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,672
 to mass-produce brownies, this 
   factory starts with canola   
              oil.              

99
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:50,075
     they add xanthan gum,      
    a natural preservative      

100
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,078
    that increases moisture     
   retention during baking.     

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,950
      they blend these two      
           ingredients          
    in an industrial mixer.     

102
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:02,888
  then they add sugar, cocoa,   

103
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,791
           and canola           
   and palm oil shortening.     

104
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,695
  they reactivate the mixer,    

105
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:14,099
 and it blends the ingredients  
   into a chocolate batter.     

106
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,735
      the next ingredients      
       are whole eggs...        

107
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,706
      ...and corn syrup.        

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,845
     the massive mixing arm     
  descends back into the bowl   

109
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:31,183
  and whips these ingredients   
       into the batter.         

110
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,186
    a worker wheels the bowl    
         to a hopper,           

111
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:37,389
         which releases         
  a precise amount of flour.    

112
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,592
  the flour thickens the mix.   

113
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:44,663
          it will give          
 the baked brownies structure.  

114
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:49,601
  after 25 minutes of mixing,   
    the batter is complete.     

115
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:54,673
   there's enough batter here   
    to make 6,000 brownies.     

116
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,277
         they transfer          
 the smooth chocolaty mixture   

117
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,579
      to a machine called a     
           depositor.           

118
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,685
    a sprayer mists the pans    
           with oil             

119
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,023
   to keep the brownies from    
     sticking to them during    
            baking.             

120
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,059
         then the pans          
   arrive at the depositor.     

121
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,096
   this computerized machine    

122
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,500
      releases the batter       
        into each pan.          

123
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,636
it has perfect aim every time.  

124
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:31,910
         next, the pans         
  enter an 11-1/2-foot oven.    

125
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,414
  the brownies rotate through   
 13 tiers to bake them evenly.  

126
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:42,788
    after about 20 minutes,     
   the brownies are cooked.     

127
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,292
       they exit the oven       
     and head into a cooling    
            chamber.            

128
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,065
         like the oven,         
      it's multi-tiered.        

129
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:59,071
    the pans move through it    
  as fans cool the brownies.    

130
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,611
          the cooling           
 helps solidify the brownies.   

131
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,279
        then a robot arm        
    with needle-like claws      

132
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,416
  lifts them out of the pans    

133
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,652
       and transfers them       
     to the next conveyer.      

134
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,956
    the robots are gentle,      

135
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,226
      so the cool brownies      
     stay intact during the     
            process.            

136
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,100
   the brownies round a corner  
               and              
 transfer to another conveyer.  

137
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,838
    at the end of the line,     

138
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,774
  a worker places the brownies  
  in a narrow conveyer system   

139
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,311
        that takes them         
   to the wrapping station.     

140
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,313
       a computer sensor        
    detects their approach      

141
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:45,184
     and alerts the plastic     
    wrapping system ahead.      

142
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:48,253
      the plastic unwinds       
   into the wrapping machine    

143
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,790
   as the brownies enter it.    

144
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,527
 metal wheels with grooves pull 
      the wrapper under the     
           brownies,            

145
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,731
     and then heated wheels     
  melt the seam to close it.    

146
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,134
    a hot jaw then seals and    
             severs             

147
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,403
        the plastic film        
     between the brownies,      

148
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,874
 creating individual packets.   

149
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,080
      a robot opens a box       

150
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,517
   and sets it on a conveyer    
   next to the brownie line.    

151
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,489
    an employee then places     
   eight packets of brownies    

152
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,191
        in each carton.         

153
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,798
 they ride by a rotary device,  

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,401
   which automatically folds    
   the ends of the cartons.     

155
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,680
then the boxes are glued shut.  

156
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,851
      finally, they travel      
   through a metal detector.    

157
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,655
    it uses a high-frequency    
    electromagnetic signal      

158
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,825
 to detect any metal fragments  
       in the brownies.         

159
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,328
    it takes about an hour      

160
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,332
  to make and package brownies  
       at this factory,         

161
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,736
   but only a fraction of that  
              time              
        to enjoy them.          

162
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,284
  narrator: pallets are used    

163
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,488
         to easily move         
  large quantities of goods.    

164
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,023
       they were invented       
   in the early 20th century    

165
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,894
    and have been a warehouse   
             staple             
          ever since.           

166
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,630
    multiple unused pallets     
       can cause clutter        

167
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,765
 and even be a safety hazard.   

168
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,635
 that's where pallet dispensers 
           come in.             

169
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,572
   before pallet dispensers,    

170
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,574
       pallets were kept        
       in loose stacks.         

171
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,911
         retrieving one         
  was potentially dangerous.    

172
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,580
      the pallet dispenser      
     solves this problem.       

173
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,317
  it helps keep the workplace   
      safe and organized.       

174
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,790
   a high-speed cnc machine     

175
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,859
    cuts out the steel parts    
   of the pallet dispenser.     

176
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,599
an employee uses a press brake  

177
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,869
     to bend the components     
    to the required shapes.     

178
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,472
       a preset backstop        

179
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,209
  ensures that the metal piece  
 goes into the precise depth.   

180
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,547
    next, a worker uses a mig   
             welder             

181
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,151
        to quickly bond         
    the new parts together.     

182
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,087
  the parts hang from chains,   

183
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,957
       which are charged        
   with a negative current.     

184
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,494
 painters then spray positively 
    charged paint on them.      

185
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,634
 the parts are baked in an oven 
    for 20 minutes to dry the   
             paint.             

186
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,503
       the traveler frame       
       moves up and down        

187
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,574
        with the pallets        
     inside the dispenser.      

188
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:58,477
            a worker            
  installs 12 cam followers.    

189
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,682
        a team positions        
  the linear track assembly.    

190
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,186
       its vertical bars        
   guide the cam followers,     

191
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,056
   keeping the traveler frame   
           on track.            

192
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,927
     once this sub-assembly     
         is complete,           

193
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,597
       workers install it       
 inside the main side frames.   

194
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,869
   together, these components   
 form the main base assembly.   

195
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:28,006
        the dispenser's         
    self-contained hydraulic    
             system             

196
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:32,477
     doesn't require power      
to control the traveler frame.  

197
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,616
          this is one           
  of two hydraulic cylinders.   

198
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:41,520
   they're designed to easily   
              hold              
   a heavy stack of pallets.    

199
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,559
           the worker           
   installs four brake arms.    

200
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,364
       they hold a set of       
spring-loaded latches in place  

201
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,966
      to keep the pallets       
    suspended in position.      

202
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,640
       next, he positions       
        the sprockets.          

203
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,044
      the pallet dispenser      
    requires four sprockets     

204
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,046
    to support two chains.      

205
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,584
          these chains          
  connect the traveler frame    

206
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,453
          to a massive          
     steel counterweight.       

207
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:20,858
     as it gets fuller, the     
            traveler            
  frame lowers to the ground.   

208
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,728
       after the pallets        
       touch the floor,         

209
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,131
       the counterweight        
       lifts the frame.         

210
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:30,202
   the pallets are stored in a  
              tall              
     column called a pallet     
           magazine.            

211
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,607
  two employees work together   
        to install it.          

212
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,075
         the magazines          
  come in two standard heights  
               --               

213
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,679
      4 feet and 8 feet.        

214
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,219
    not all pallet magazines    
           are red.             

215
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,589
      customers can select      
from a wide variety of colors.  

216
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,959
      the interior panels       

217
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,962
    protect the dispenser's     
 mechanism from being damaged.  

218
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,364
they're also the access panels  

219
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,167
        to the product's        
    precision engineering.      

220
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,303
     a trained professional     
     should always handle       

221
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,839
   the machine's maintenance    
          and repair.           

222
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,175
       making the panels        
    relatively inaccessible     

223
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,645
    decreases the chances of    
      tampering, injury, or     
           accidents            

224
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,147
        by an amateur.          

225
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,452
         next, a worker         
 runs a quality-control test.   

226
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,587
    he uses a walkie rider      

227
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,891
  to raise a stack of pallets   
  and remove the bottom one.    

228
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,595
        when he's done,         
     the hydraulic system       

229
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,231
        lowers the stack        
      back into position.       

230
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,802
     here, one worker uses a    
            forklift            

231
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:42,808
   to raise the top section of  
               the              
 pallet magazine into position  

232
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,278
     while the other worker     
    guides the magazine into    
             place.             

233
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,215
      graphics and decals       
   have already been added,     

234
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,950
       so all that's left       
       is for the worker        

235
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,953
        to securely bolt        
  the two sections together.    

236
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:02,427
  with about 2 billion pallets  
      in the u.s. alone,        

237
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,696
    things can really start     
          to pile up.           

238
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,900
    pallet stackers make life   
             easier             

239
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:12,070
 for manufacturers and shippers 
      all over the world.       

240
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:23,448
  some refer to these devices   
   as giant pez dispensers.     

241
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,185
           in a way,            
 that's exactly what they are,  

242
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,820
   and they're just as safe.    

243
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,867
    narrator: once reserved     
   for palaces and castles,     

244
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,471
   today's chandeliers can be   
              found             
in even the most modest homes.  

245
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,740
     they function as more      
   than just a light source.    

246
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:51,409
       chandeliers can be       
 the illuminating centerpieces  

247
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,880
  of traditional rooms or give  
    modern rooms an eclectic    
            twists.             

248
00:16:55,882 --> 00:17:00,051
      either way, a crystal     
           chandelier           
      is always elegant and     
           timeless.            

249
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,821
        this chandelier         
    is quite a showstopper.     

250
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,158
          it stretches          
more than 3 feet high and wide  

251
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,694
     with 24 elegant arms.      

252
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,297
         it's decorated         
  with clear and red crystal    

253
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,500
  and a gilded hurricane shade  
       over each light.         

254
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:19,036
 to make the crystal, they melt 
   silica sand in a furnace,    

255
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,508
   along with lead, hot ash,    
and several other ingredients.  

256
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,044
     the materials combine      
    to make crystal heavier     

257
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,446
and more sparkling than glass.  

258
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,849
  to make each chandelier arm,  
       a crystal blower         

259
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,920
  gathers some molten crystal   
  on the end of his blowpipe,   

260
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:38,723
    then shapes the arm with    
 a series of blocks and molds.  

261
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,660
      he makes a channel        

262
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,462
        down the middle         
    for the arm's electrical    
            wiring.             

263
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,666
    next, two master crystal    
             blowers            
         work together          

264
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:52,470
 to pull and twist the crystal  
    into the arm's rope-like    
            design.             

265
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,007
         this maneuver          
requires tremendous expertise.  

266
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,009
     to achieve the correct     
           diameter,            

267
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:03,214
  these craftsmen must stretch  
  the crystal exactly right.    

268
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,151
       next, they put it        
   in a chandelier arm mold     

269
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,087
    and snip off the excess     
         on both ends.          

270
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,457
       they blow cold air       
   to solidify the crystal.     

271
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,361
       another craftsman        
 inspects the chandelier arm,   

272
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,898
      checking the shape,       
         measurements,          

273
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,567
          and channel           
  for the electrical wiring.    

274
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,172
   next, a pair of craftsmen    

275
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,507
  make the bowl-shaped bottom   
      of the chandelier.        

276
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,043
 using traditional techniques,  

277
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,445
   they place molten crystal    
          in a mold,            

278
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,781
    then place the mold in a    
             press.             

279
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,454
  the crystal chandelier parts  
  are cooled down in an oven.   

280
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,722
      the gradual decrease      
        in temperature          

281
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,458
    slowly releases tension     
        in the crystal.         

282
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,128
    this prevents cracking.     

283
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,333
  straight out of the furnace,  
 the crystal is 2,280 degrees.  

284
00:18:55,335 --> 00:19:00,138
   it continues to be pliable   
              until             
     it reaches about 1,202     
            degrees.            

285
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,407
       it cools rapidly,        
   so as the craftsmen work,    

286
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,278
 they must regularly reheat the 
 crystal in a smaller furnace.  

287
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,150
   the freshly molded crystal   
tends to have a rough surface,  

288
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:16,221
     so they use heat from      
 a blowtorch to smooth it out.  

289
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:20,558
   these holders support the    
 hurricane shades on the arms.  

290
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,761
   this company produces its    
signature shade of red crystal  

291
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,097
by adding 24-karat gold powder  

292
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,666
      to the raw materials      
        in the furnace.         

293
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,968
       the color emerges        
    after the molded piece      

294
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,307
     is reheated in an oven     
  to just over 1,000 degrees.   

295
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,044
        a crystal blower        
  makes the hurricane shades.   

296
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,915
   first, he rolls a starting   
              shape             
  at the end of his blowpipe.   

297
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,383
      then, with pliers,        

298
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,386
  he narrows and stretches one  
               end              
        to form a neck.         

299
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,589
     by now, the crystal has    
            cooled,             

300
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,926
        so he reheats it        
      before continuing.        

301
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,660
 next, he inserts the crystal   

302
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,531
   into a foot-pedal-operated   
              mold              
    installed in the floor.     

303
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,801
     he then turns the pipe     
     and blows through it       

304
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,503
     to expand the crystal      
      to the mold shape.        

305
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,543
    once the hurricane shade    
          has cooled,           

306
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,613
  artisans apply an elaborate   
     24-karat gold decal.       

307
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,616
    with a paintbrush, they     
   also apply raised gilding    

308
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,285
   and 24-karat gold paste.     

309
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,290
      they heat the shade       
     to fuse the gold to the    
            crystal,            

310
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:29,894
      then polish the gold      
     with an agate stone.       

311
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,831
   every part of the crystal    
    chandelier is handmade,     

312
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,835
   and the entire chandelier    
    is manually assembled.      

313
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,238
            however,            
   some of the crystal parts    

314
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,841
       require prep work        
       before assembly.         

315
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,779
  the arms have a light socket  
          at one end            

316
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,614
      wired to a connector      
         at the other.          

317
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,252
          all 24 arms           
    mount to a round tray.      

318
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,255
   beneath it, the connectors   
    link to the main wires      

319
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,457
    running down the center     
      of the chandelier.        

320
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,196
 the chandelier's ornate bottom 
         hides it all.          

321
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,065
     the electrical sockets     
   that hold the light bulbs    

322
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,134
     are hidden inside metal    
            sleeves             

323
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,504
         painted white          
     to look like candles.      

324
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,209
  the gilded hurricane shades   

325
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,513
      go over the candles       
and sit snugly in the holders.  

326
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:32,023
      this stunning crystal     
           chandelier           
    casts sparkling light,      

327
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:35,026
        easily making it        
 the focal point of the room.   

328
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,428
     weighing in at over 150    
            pounds,             

329
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,167
  this grand chandelier makes   
 a big, bold design statement.
