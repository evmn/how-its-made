00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,452
            narrator:           
       industrial machines      

4
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,255
     often have heavy loads     
        to lift or pull.        

5
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,190
             whether            
    it's a dragline excavator   

6
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,926
  working in an open-pit mine,  

7
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:03,062
      an oil-drilling rig,      
      a construction crane,     

8
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,730
       or farm machinery,       

9
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,467
       the weight is borne      
   by ultrastrong wire ropes.   

10
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,206
      industrial-wire ropes     

11
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:18,210
typically range from 8/10" to 5"
          in diameter.          

12
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,145
 besides machinery applications,

13
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,081
         they also serve        
        as support cables       

14
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,883
  for large static structures,  

15
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,952
         such as bridges        
       and stadium roofs.       

16
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,189
    manufacturing a wire rope   
     begins with steel wire     

17
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:35,027
  that's anywhere from 3/1,000" 
      to 3/10" in diameter.     

18
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,096
    the first step is to wind   
 several of these wires together

19
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,498
         into a strand.         

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,833
    how many wires per strand   

21
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,168
       depends on the job       
     the rope will perform,     

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,704
 because different applications 

23
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,506
    require different degrees   
  of flexibility and strength.  

24
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,841
      each wire is spooled      
      onto a steel bobbin       

25
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,910
           and loaded           
    onto a stranding machine,   

26
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,580
      which is essentially      
         a giant winder.        

27
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,849
      there can be as many      
    as 64 wires in a strand,    

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,787
   although the typical range   
      is between 19 and 36.     

29
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,456
       the twisting wires       
       converge in a die        

30
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,459
         that forms them        
    to the required diameter.   

31
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,195
    lubrication is critical,    

32
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:12,531
and not merely to help the wires
 move smoothly through the die. 

33
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,266
    it also penetrates within   

34
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,136
    to allow slight movement    
       between the wires.       

35
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,871
 this increases their life span 

36
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,208
     and prevents the strand    
          from seizing.         

37
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,678
  the strand exits the machine  
     saturated in lubricant.    

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,415
    a large rubber band skims   
   the excess off the surface.  

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,887
     the strand now travels     
 through a row of straighteners.

40
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,557
       these heavy rollers      
    apply vertical pressure,    

41
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,692
       effectively erasing      
        the wire's memory       

42
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,496
  of being spooled on a bobbin  
       prior to stranding.      

43
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:46,232
     this prevents the wires    
        from unraveling.        

44
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,769
       this cross-section       

45
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:53,572
       shows all the wires      
   inside the finished strand.  

46
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,642
    the clothespin gives you    
      a sense of its size.      

47
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,777
 wire strands are by themselves 

48
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,515
         typically used         
  as structural support cables. 

49
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:06,052
   to make wire ropes used in   
machinery and for heavy lifting,

50
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,788
 they take several of these wire
 strands and wind them together 

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,426
  on a far bigger and stronger  
    machine called a closer.    

52
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:20,866
 they make this particular rope 
     from six wire strands.     

53
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,335
       before the strands       
      converge in the die,      

54
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,605
     rollers pre-shape them     
   into a corkscrew-like form.  

55
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:30,476
 the strands then enter the die,
 twisting together over a core, 

56
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,812
         which is itself        
    a small steel-wire rope.    

57
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,413
      a core at the center      
          of the cable          

58
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,750
  provides additional strength. 

59
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:41,220
 this cable's finished diameter 
           is 3 1/2".           

60
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,690
    however, there are always   
small variations here and there,

61
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,025
             so now             
    four calibration rollers,   

62
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,695
   two compressing vertically,  
        two horizontally,       

63
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:53,965
 correct the cable to the right 
 diameter all along its length. 

64
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,969
       the finished cable       
  winds onto a big steel reel,  

65
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,771
       ready for shipping.      

66
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:06,112
the factory tests random samples
   in its quality-control lab.  

67
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,514
    there, a machine measures   
     the tensile strength --    

68
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:12,785
     how much pulling force     
    the cable can withstand.    

69
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:16,989
  the machine pulls the cable   
  at both ends until it snaps.  

70
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,390
         [ cable snaps ]        

71
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:23,329
      for this mega cable,      
the breaking point was 104 tons.

72
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,997
    to pass the test, a cable   

73
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,734
must exceed the tensile strength
   it's designed to withstand.  

74
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:32,537
      for certain demanding     
  applications, such as mining, 

75
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,940
           wire ropes           
  are double-coated in plastic  

76
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,610
           to protect           
     against wear and tear.     

77
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,411
     to prepare the plastic,    
           the factory          

78
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,948
     mixes a recipe of clear    
  and colored plastic pellets.  

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,551
   an extrusion machine heats   
 the pellets until they liquefy,

80
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,021
 then forces the molten plastic 
         through a die,         

81
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,557
        coating the rope        
      as it passes through.     

82
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,228
           as the rope          
  exits the extrusion machine,  

83
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,763
    it passes through water,    

84
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,666
     which cools and hardens    
        the hot plastic.        

85
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,170
  the plastic not only jackets  
       the rope's surface,      

86
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,307
   it also provides cushioning  
      when on the jobsite,      

87
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:12,244
 the strands inside rub against 
 each other as the rope moves.  

88
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,912
    by reducing wear and tear   

89
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,515
          on the steel          
 both internally and externally,

90
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:21,854
   plastic coating can extend   
the life of a rope by up to 50%.

91
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,656
 a cable's internal construction

92
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,258
     determines its strength    
        and flexibility.        

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,529
  a structural one needs to be  
  strong, immobile, and taut,   

94
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,531
     so it's a single strand    
      made of large wires,      

95
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,935
      whereas a moving rope     
       and large machinery      

96
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,772
     contains many strands      
     made of smaller wires.     

97
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:57,022
     narrator: a living wall    
     is a vertical structure    

98
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,757
covered with fully grown plants.

99
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,627
        this green screen       
      serves many purposes,     

100
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,230
  such as hiding an eyesore or  
 shielding an area for privacy. 

101
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,966
       some are installed       
         in the ground,         

102
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:09,168
    while others are mounted    
       on building facades      

103
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,971
            and have            
 integrated irrigation systems. 

104
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,110
          living walls          
      are modular systems.      

105
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,579
           each module          
  contains fully grown plants,  

106
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,915
      so upon installation,     

107
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,784
     the green-screen effect    
          is immediate.         

108
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,520
           the plants           
    are hedera helix woerner,   

109
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,590
 a variety of ivy that's highly 
 resistant to cold and drought. 

110
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,396
      in the manufacturer's     
          greenhouses,          

111
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,766
 horticulturalists take cuttings
    from the mother plants...   

112
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:47,272
   ...then cut off the foliage  
    and separate the leaves,    

113
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,975
 leaving each with a small stem.

114
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:59,318
  then they plant the cuttings  
      five leaves to a pot.     

115
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,756
   the soil is a secret recipe  

116
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,460
         of organic and         
 nonorganic materials and feed. 

117
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,836
       over the next month      
          to six weeks,         

118
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,639
            each stem           
  develops a good root system.  

119
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,444
       meanwhile, workers       
    construct a welded frame    

120
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,846
      out of high-strength      
          carbon steel.         

121
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,784
     the metal is galvanized    
       so it's rust-proof.      

122
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,053
    once the frame is ready,    
         they take a mat        

123
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,522
    made from biodegradable,    
     recycled coconut husks     

124
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,324
           and fold it          
       into a planter box,      

125
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,926
           which fits           
 inside the bottom of the frame.

126
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,464
   two side wires hold the box  
       securely in place.       

127
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,201
      an automated machine      
          fills the box         

128
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,271
     with the same soil mix     
     used for the cuttings.     

129
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,812
   then the horticulturalists   
    plant 13 pots of plants.    

130
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,481
    that's 65 ivies per box.    

131
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,022
   they wrap the longer stems   

132
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,590
       around the uprights      
          of the frame.         

133
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:23,435
       the frames now move      
       to the greenhouse,       

134
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:26,205
    where they're hooked up     
    to an irrigation system.    

135
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,645
  for the next 18 months or so, 
        the plants grow,        

136
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,315
         and as they do,        
      the horticulturalists     

137
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:39,317
     keep wrapping the ends     
      around the uprights.      

138
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,553
         this is called         
      training the plants.      

139
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,862
     as the plants thicken,     

140
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,967
 the nursery workers prune them 
    to promote upward growth.   

141
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,745
      the factory produces      
   these green-screen modules   

142
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,883
          in 3 heights,         
 ranging from about 3 to 7 feet.

143
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,550
       after installation,      

144
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,488
   the plants can grow on-site  
  to a total height of 13 feet. 

145
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:23,762
    each frame -- one module    
  of the living-wall system --  

146
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:28,000
         is 4 feet wide,        
 making it easily transportable.

147
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,308
 at shipping time, workers load 
   the screens 10 to a pallet   

148
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,111
         and truck them         
    to the installation site.   

149
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,985
    each module of the system   
   installs just like a fence.  

150
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,586
   workers embed a wooden post  

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,790
         on either side         
  of where each screen will go  

152
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,859
        and dig a trench        
   that's the width and depth   

153
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,262
       of the planter box       
       running in between.      

154
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,598
       they sit the screen      
         in the trench,         

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,867
           then, with           
   galvanized-steel brackets,   

156
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,204
    clip it to the side posts   
     at the top and bottom.     

157
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,809
   then they fill in the gaps   
           with dirt.           

158
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,955
        the screens have        
   a 45-year life expectancy,   

159
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,758
         and the leaves         
   remain on them year-round.   

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,294
          this variety          
     is used on living walls    

161
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,830
  in europe and warmer regions. 

162
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,031
       in colder climates,      

163
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,234
      the manufacturer uses     
    a hardier species of ivy    

164
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,838
      that stays green even     
throughout harsh, snowy winters.

165
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,389
            narrator:           
      a large-format camera     

166
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,859
         is essentially         
    great-granddad's camera,    

167
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,862
  the one with accordion-style  
     bellows, the big film,     

168
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,598
         and the curtain        
 draped around the viewfinder --

169
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,602
     19th century technology    
  with some modern refinements. 

170
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:15,274
 for many serious photographers,
 the basic concept still clicks.

171
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:20,812
     in an age when cameras     
 are miniaturized and digitized,

172
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,949
     the large-format camera    
    might seem to be a relic.   

173
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,618
          but for pros,         
      it's a creative tool.     

174
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,888
   the flexible bellows allow   
  for a wide range of movements 

175
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,624
     for incredible control     
          of the image.         

176
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,693
          image quality         
     is another attraction.     

177
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:39,164
this camera uses big sheet film,
         4" x 5" and up,        

178
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,431
    generating big negatives    

179
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,235
 that don't need to be enlarged 
    as much during printing,    

180
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,704
          so the image          
     has better resolution.     

181
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,039
        at this factory,        

182
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,909
 they mold many of the camera's 
      parts out of plastic.     

183
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,445
   they inject liquid plastic   
           into molds,          

184
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,647
 and the parts quickly solidify.

185
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,781
      other parts are made      

186
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,051
      of laser-cut aluminum     
      and stainless steel.      

187
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,787
        the camera maker        
    assembles the base first,   

188
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,959
   attaching rails that slide   
  back and forth for focusing.  

189
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,130
      the next parts allow      
  for swing and shift action -- 

190
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:16,200
  movements that come in handy  
     when composing a shot.     

191
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,537
    he attaches the camera's    
      molded, plastic body      

192
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,840
to the swing and shift assembly.

193
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,945
       next, he assembles       
  the front part of the camera, 

194
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,481
           which holds          
      the lens and shutter.     

195
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,350
             it has             
   a swing and tilt mechanism   

196
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:35,019
          for changing          
    a shot's depth of field.    

197
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,090
   he slides the lens holder    
   into place and secures it.   

198
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:43,695
  it can be raised and lowered  
    when composing the shot.    

199
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,097
    he inserts spirit levels    
         into the slots         

200
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,500
 in the front and rear sections 
         of the camera.         

201
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,971
    these levels will be used   
 to check the angle of the shot.

202
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,039
           moving now           
     to the focusing screen,    

203
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,376
   it's made of ground acrylic  
        to diffuse light.       

204
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,979
  he protects the acrylic from  
  scratches with a glass plate  

205
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:06,451
    and secures the assembly    
   with stainless-steel clips.  

206
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,386
            he snaps            
  the completed focusing screen 

207
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,323
   to the body of the camera,   
 where it can be easily switched

208
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,260
          from portrait         
     to landscape position.     

209
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:19,765
  he tests the focus mechanism  
 and confirms it's operational. 

210
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,537
  he now folds and glues fabric 
  in an accordion configuration 

211
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,072
   to create expanding bellows  

212
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:32,077
    that will link the front    
  and rear parts of the camera. 

213
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,011
  he applies double-sided tape  

214
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,848
      around the inner lip      
     of the folded bellows.     

215
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,457
he sticks more double-sided tape
     onto a plastic frame...    

216
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:53,265
   ...and peels away the tape   
 backing in strategic locations.

217
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,837
      he inserts the frame      
        into the bellows        

218
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,439
          and aligns it         
  with the taped inner border.  

219
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,576
  he then completely peels off  
        the taped backing       

220
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:08,046
      and presses the frame     
   to the bellows' taped rim.   

221
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:12,984
this frame adds crucial rigidity
         to the bellows.        

222
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,587
  using more double-sided tape  
          and adhesive,         

223
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,255
           he secures           
     the bellows' accordion     

224
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,758
     to a larger fabric bag.    

225
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,864
 next, he glues plastic flanges 
   to each end of the bellows.  

226
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,533
the flanges are connector pieces
    for attaching the bellows   

227
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,804
 to the front and rear sections 
         of the camera.         

228
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,340
 there are two kinds of bellows.

229
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,808
  the one with the bag attached 

230
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,077
   is usually used with a lens  
     of short focal length.     

231
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,415
an accordion without the bag has
a much longer range of extension

232
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,218
  to accommodate a bigger lens. 

233
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,621
    he now connects the back    
   of the camera to the front   

234
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,356
        with the bellows.       

235
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,292
    they are a flexible link    
        between the two.        

236
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,161
          by expanding          
   or retracting the bellows,   

237
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,897
        the photographer        
     can adjust the distance    

238
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,801
    between the lens and film   
       to focus the shot.       

239
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:10,107
  finally, he attaches the lens 
   to the front of the camera.  

240
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,844
 it's now ready for a film test.

241
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,646
        he loads the film       
        into the holder.        

242
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,848
     normally, this is done     
      in complete darkness      

243
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,050
to prevent exposure of the film.

244
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,053
   but he's left the lights on  
         for our camera.        

245
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,857
 the film slides into the holder
      into the camera back.     

246
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,527
   and while film still rules   
  in large-format photography,  

247
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,529
            there are           
    now digital camera backs    

248
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,065
        for photographers       
    who want instant results    

249
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,569
with traditional focus movements
     of the bellows camera.     

250
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,207
   it's all a matter of focus.  

251
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,761
narrator: man has used gemstones
      since ancient times.      

252
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,297
        genuine gemstones       
       come from nature --      

253
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,966
    minerals, rocks, or even    
   certain organic materials.   

254
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,168
    shaped, cut, and polished   

255
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,170
    to bring out their colors   
         and brilliance,        

256
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,373
 the rarest ones are classified 
        as precious gems,       

257
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,876
   the others as semiprecious.  

258
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:23,114
     this semiprecious stone    
      is called blue john.      

259
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,183
         it's a variety         
    of the mineral fluorite,    

260
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,852
    also known as fluorspar.    

261
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,721
     while common fluorspar     
       is cream or white,       

262
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,124
            blue john           
   also has magnificent bands   

263
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,727
  of purple, blue, and yellow.  

264
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,864
  there's only one place in the 
 world where blue john is found,

265
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,600
    and that's in the village   
    of castleton, derbyshire,   

266
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,669
       in central england.      

267
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,070
  the stone comes from a cavern 

268
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:51,209
   located some 55 yards deep   
         in a hillside.         

269
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,612
the miners don't use explosives,

270
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,014
        because the stone       
    is quite soft and brittle   

271
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,616
      in its natural state,     

272
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:01,286
          and blasting          
    would simply shatter it.    

273
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,954
    instead, they use drills    

274
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:07,325
  to carefully dislodge pieces  
of blue john from the rock wall.

275
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,638
 they carry the blue john to the
 surface to the mine's workshop,

276
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,574
     where stone processors     
   manually wash off the clay.  

277
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,976
        the stone is wet        

278
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:29,047
 due to having been underground 
   for some 240 million years,  

279
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,583
   so they put it into an oven  
         at low heat --         

280
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,251
     176 degrees fahrenheit.    

281
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,121
 when the stone comes out of the
  oven a couple of weeks later, 

282
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:40,124
all its moisture has evaporated.

283
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,928
    the dried stone, however,   
        is still brittle,       

284
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,997
       so they submerge it      
   in a bowl of liquid resin,   

285
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,600
       then place the bowl      
       into a vacuum oven       

286
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,403
   at 176 degrees fahrenheit.   

287
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,772
          this process          
      draws out all the air     

288
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:57,142
      and forces the resin      
  deep into the stone's pores.  

289
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:01,212
the stone then goes into another
 oven at 122 degrees fahrenheit 

290
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,481
       for about 12 hours.      

291
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,949
     this hardens the resin,    

292
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,954
stabilizing the stone so that it
can be worked without crumbling.

293
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,490
     to create large items,     
   such as goblets and bowls,   

294
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,960
     the workshop's artisans    
   turn the stone on a lathe.   

295
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:20,031
  to avoid fracturing it, they  
 must work the blue john slowly 

296
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,033
 and with diamond-tipped tools. 

297
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,836
      diamond, being harder     
      than all other rocks,     

298
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,238
cuts with less force and stress.

299
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,373
    to supply jewelry makers,   

300
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,309
        the mine workshop       
     saws stones into slices    

301
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,812
   using a diamond-edged saw.   

302
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,447
    at the jewelry workshop,    

303
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,718
a gemologist examines the slices
         on a light box         

304
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,854
    to highlight the coloring   
         and any flaws.         

305
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,190
      this helps determine      
    which parts of the slice    

306
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:48,593
           will yield           
  the most striking gemstones.  

307
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,396
   meanwhile, in another part   
        of the workshop,        

308
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,531
      a silversmith crafts      
     the piece of jewelry --    

309
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,134
          in this case,         
     a sterling-silver ring     

310
00:18:56,136 --> 00:19:00,205
       which will receive       
     the blue john gemstone.    

311
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:04,142
she bends, then solders together
  the ends of the ring's shank, 

312
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,745
            the part            
   that encircles the finger.   

313
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,347
         after grinding         
      the solder seam flat,     

314
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,216
 she fuses the top of the ring, 
       called the setting,      

315
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,220
         onto the shank.        

316
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:19,090
 then she polishes the ring and 
 passes it onto the gemologist, 

317
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,357
 who takes a slice of blue john 

318
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,494
            and, with           
  a diamond-edged lapidary saw, 

319
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,696
 cuts out the gemstone's shape, 

320
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,901
    making it slightly larger   
        than the setting.       

321
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:33,772
  next, she glues on a backing  
    cut from mother-of-pearl.   

322
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,106
    just like the white light   

323
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,909
     on which the gemologist    
 examined the blue john slices, 

324
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,644
  this mother-of-pearl backing  

325
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,113
      highlights the colors     
          in the stone.         

326
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,720
           now, using           
 a diamond-grit grinding wheel, 

327
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,723
      she shapes the stone      
to perfectly fit in the setting.

328
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,935
 she applies glue to the setting

329
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,838
      and fits the gemstone     
         snugly inside.         

330
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,545
      once the glue dries,      

331
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:17,615
 she uses a diamond-grit sanding
 belt to smooth down the edges, 

332
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,720
gradually transforming the rough
     oval into a sleek dome.    

333
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,092
         this gem shape         
     is known as a cabochon.    

334
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,300
      finally, she polishes     
    the entire ring's surface   

335
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,904
      until the silver and      
 richly hued blue john glisten. 

336
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:46,311
  whether it's one of several,  
 the shape funky or traditional,

337
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:50,915
      a gemstone sure makes     
    a piece of jewelry rock.    

338
