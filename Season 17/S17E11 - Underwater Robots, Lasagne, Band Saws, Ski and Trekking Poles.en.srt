workers use this jig as a       

385
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,270
of the assembly process.

the wheels must be perfectly    
balanced to keep the saw blades 

389
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,611
the wheels must be perfectly    
balanced to keep the saw blades 
stable while it's cutting.      

390
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,380
balanced to keep the saw blades 
stable while it's cutting.      
once the alignment's complete,  

391
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,315
stable while it's cutting.      
once the alignment's complete,  
workers remove the jig and loop 

392
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,117
once the alignment's complete,  
workers remove the jig and loop 
the steel saw blade around the  

393
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:24,655
workers remove the jig and loop 
the steel saw blade around the  
two wheels.                     

394
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,057
the steel saw blade around the  
two wheels.                     
they adjust the blade to the    

395
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,459
two wheels.                     
they adjust the blade to the    
correct tautness by simply      

396
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,127
they adjust the blade to the    
correct tautness by simply      
setting the tension gauge to the

397
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:38,436
correct tautness by simply      
setting the tension gauge to the
width of the blade.             

398
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,171
setting the tension gauge to the

the owner of the factory now    
surveys a lineup of ski poles.  
he's on the lookout for smudges 

503
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,638
surveys a lineup of ski poles.  
he's on the lookout for smudges 
or other flaws.                 

504
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,373
he's on the lookout for smudges 
or other flaws.                 
they meet his approval, and so  

505
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,243
or other flaws.                 
they meet his approval, and so  
it's on to the next step.       

506
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,112
they meet his approval, and so  
it's on to the next step.       
a carriage moves each ski pole  

507
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,980
it's on to the next step.       
a carriage moves each ski pole  
forward towards a carbide tip   

508
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,815
a carriage moves each ski pole  
forward towards a carbide tip   
and presses the tip into the    

509
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:49,320
forward towards a carbide tip   
and presses the tip into the    
tapered end.                    

510
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,055
and presses the tip into the    
tapered end.                    
with this tough tip in place,   

511
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,923
tapered end.                    
with this tough tip in place,   
the ski pole is now equipped to 

512
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:57,361
with this tough tip in place,   
the ski pole is now equipped to 
pierce any hard snow pack.      

513
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,730
the ski pole is now equipped to 
pierce any hard snow pack.      
next, a worker slides rubber    

514
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,331
pierce any hard snow pack.      
next, a worker slides rubber    
grips onto the handle end of the

515
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:05,236
next, a worker slides rubber    
grips onto the handle end of the
poles.                          

516
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,937
grips onto the handle end of the
poles.                          
like a big automated fist, a    

517
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,740
poles.                          
like a big automated fist, a    
hydraulic mechanism shoves the  

518
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,608
like a big automated fist, a    
hydraulic mechanism shoves the  
grip more tightly onto the pole.

519
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:24,155
there are many different kinds  
of grips, each with a different 
look and feel depending on the  

520
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,957
of grips, each with a different 
look and feel depending on the  
type of pole being made.        

521
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,058
look and feel depending on the  
type of pole being made.        
some ski-pole grips even have   

522
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,961
type of pole being made.        
some ski-pole grips even have   
clips for attaching gloves.     

523
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,062
some ski-pole grips even have   
clips for attaching gloves.     
trekking-pole shafts now roll   

524
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,298
clips for attaching gloves.     
trekking-pole shafts now roll   
down the production line.       

525
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,234
trekking-pole shafts now roll   
down the production line.       
an automated arm slides plastic 

526
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,236
down the production line.       
an automated arm slides plastic 
sleeves with carbide points onto

527
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:43,107
an automated arm slides plastic 
sleeves with carbide points onto
the lower shaft section.        

528
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,842
sleeves with carbide points onto
the lower shaft section.        
a spinning tool drives part of  

529
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,444
the lower shaft section.        
a spinning tool drives part of  
an expander mechanism into the  

530
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:49,680
a spinning tool drives part of  
an expander mechanism into the  
trekking pole's middle shaft.   

531
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,015
an expander mechanism into the  
trekking pole's middle shaft.   
this expander will allow the    

532
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,183
trekking pole's middle shaft.   
this expander will allow the    
pole to be lengthened or        

533
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,417
this expander will allow the    
pole to be lengthened or        
shortened to the user's         

534
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,153
pole to be lengthened or        
shortened to the user's         
preference.                     

535
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,288
machinery then inserts the other

536
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,056
part of the expander mechanism  

537
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,359
into the lower shaft.           

538
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,094
finally, a worker assembles the 

539
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,796
parts, sliding one section of   

540
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,398
the expander mechanism on the   

541
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:12,203
other.                          

542
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,673
finally, she sharpens the tips. 

543
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,408
and these poles are now ready   

544
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,276
for action.
