2
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:02,928
ago when people began lacing animal bones to the soles of  

3
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,400
water. in 1592, a scotsman invented an  iron skate b 

4
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:16,742
long, the sport of speed skating took off. these elite-level racing sk 

5
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:22,281
are produced by a small company cofounded by a canadian speed  

6
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:28,153
medalist in short track. every single pair is  cus 

7
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:34,493
after measuring a skater's feet, a technician applies layers of 

8
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:40,366
way one makes a cast for a broken limb, only here, each  

9
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:51,243
parts. each cast serves as the  fi 

10
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:58,917
boot. the plaster bandages take 5 to 

11
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:04,723
at which point the technician carefully removes the mold one part at a time, then  rea 

12
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:11,931
it with elastic bands. he surrounds the mold, called a  negative, wi 

13
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:16,268
he then pours liquid plaster into the negative to produce a 

14
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,672
the sand provides counterpressure so that the   

15
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:27,079
outward and distort their shape. the plaster fully cures in an hour or two, at which point  

16
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:32,751
negative mold can come off. then the technician mixes up  

17
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:36,755
to make it easily visible against the dried, white    

18
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:42,427
he applies it in select areas, touching up imperfections and tweaking the shape of the m 

19
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:48,066
he files the toes and the rest of the contours smooth, producing the final shape of  

20
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:54,040
boot. he labels the finished mold with the skater's name and puts it 

21
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:58,978
the storeroom until it's time to begin constructing the skate  

22
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,315
construction begins with boot lining. they staple 

23
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:08,054
leather to the mold, pulling taut because any wrinkles in  

24
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:13,392
skater's foot. next, they glue on the various structural pieces, such as   

25
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:18,931
ankle padding. it's made of memory foam so it gradually forms to the     

26
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:25,337
ankle and holds the shape. the next step is the most technically critical because  

27
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,675
determines the angle of the skate blade. they apply epoxy-resin putty  

28
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:35,548
the front and back of the sole and adhere two aluminum blade  

29
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:43,222
then prop up the boot as the putty dries over the next four 

30
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:48,226
once the putty's hard, they sand off the excess to lighten the  

31
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,364
remainder. then they begin constructing the  outside of  

32
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:57,102
first, they layer pieces of carbon fiber, a strong fabric  

33
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,973
high-performance sports products. they tie the bottom piece a 

34
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:07,112
the blade holders with strong thread and bind the layers with spray adhesi 

35
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:26,865
next, they slip a plastic bag over the boot...   tie  

36
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:38,877
and vacuum out the air. this tightly compresses the l 

37
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:50,622
now they inject resin, a type of liquid plastic, and distribute 

38
00:04:50,624 --> 00:05:02,434
the resin impregnates the carbon fiber.  after a co 

39
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:10,709
resin dries and hardens, leaving the carbon-fiber boot stiff and    durable.  

40
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:22,988
next, they glue on the outside of the boot, made of vinyl. once the glue dries, they r 

41
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,527
the plaster mold and stitch the vinyl in place.   they  

42
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:35,533
cover, sew one side of it to the boot, and attach the other side with a hook  

43
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:42,074
that way it hinges open and closed for lacing and unlacing 

44
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:47,880
the final step is to attach the inline wheels, or steel blades,  to the bl

>> narrator: synthetic rubber was invented in 1909, but the  

46
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,173
couple of decades. a shortage of natural rubber during world war ii spurred  

47
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:18,644
development. a kind of elastic plastic, it  

48
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:27,585
temperature extremes than natural rubber. synthetic rubber reinvented  

49
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,789
wheel. we're talking about the rubber 

50
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:36,194
tires for all kinds of vehicles are now made from it.  thi 

51
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:42,067
used to make everything from garden hoses to golf balls. m 

52
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,806
is now a computerized process, one that takes place under the 

53
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:52,077
operator. he monitors numerous computer screens and live camera    

54
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,015
the plan itself is 437 yards long.    there are 

55
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:01,887
enormous storage tanks for the raw materials, as well as se 

56
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,426
the raw materials include a petroleum-based liquid called  

57
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:11,630
hexane. they pipe these ingredients through columns to boil off  

58
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,901
residual water, essentially purifying them.  this i 

59
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:20,038
demonstration of what happens next.    they comb 

60
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,110
butadiene and hexane and add a catalyst. the catalyst triggers a    

61
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:30,516
that changes the chemistry. the mix becomes polybutadiene, a kind of synthetic rubber   

62
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:35,053
to make tires. adding another catalyst stops  

63
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,124
moment. the white, milky liquid that  

64
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:45,930
rubber. they now pump in chemicals to tailor it for a specific use, 

65
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:51,669
this case tires. the additives will increase   

66
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:57,276
a mechanized whisk stirs the additives into the liquid ru 

67
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:01,146
they pipe the synthetic concoction into insulated st 

68
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:05,684
inside, pumps mix it constantly so the additives don't settle on   the bottom. 

69
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:10,222
he's a close-up look at the liquid synthetic rubber in a  

70
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:17,896
it looks like a big vanilla milkshake, and it's about to be coagulated in 

71
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:22,300
here's where it all happens. this coagulation unit is like a   big kettle. 

72
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:28,307
they pipe in the liquid rubber, a solvent mixture, and water.  

73
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:33,445
the rubber coagulates into crumbs the size of beans. the water remains because it  

74
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:38,717
a higher boiling point. the mix of water and rubber c 

75
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,990
known as the crumb tank until it's time for more processing. 

76
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:51,863
rotary sieve. as it spins, it drains off the 

77
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,668
they add more water to cool the rubber crumbs. the rubber and water mix gu 

78
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,140
onto a conveyor which is a vibrating sieve. as the crumbs bounce along,  

79
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:11,416
water drains off through the perforations in the conveyor.  

80
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:20,192
lot like wet snow. next, it's into the lab, where 

81
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:25,697
light through a sample to analyze the microstructure. i 

82
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:30,636
continues. a screw-like mechanism presses the wet rubber crumbs against 

83
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:37,910
metal plate to squeeze out more moisture.    another 

84
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:43,315
vibrating conveyor drains off droplets.   then it' 

85
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:49,321
spiral conveyor. as the synthetic rubber travels upwards on 

86
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:56,528
is piped in from the side to dry it. now mostly de 

87
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,000
but still sticky, the synthetic rubber crumbs head down a chute and into a baler     

88
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:07,405
this machine uses pressure to compress the crumbs into big  

89
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:13,078
the bales of synthetic rubber head down a conveyor towards a 

90
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,949
this inspector examines them for imperfections.  once h 

91
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:24,222
they head to the packaging station. as they travel through a    

92
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:29,227
of plastic film, machinery heat-seals it around them. these bales of synthetic ru 

93
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:39,304
have taken about six hours to manufacture.    and t 

94
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:44,042
creation isn't much different from the real thing. like 

95
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:51,516
melted and shaped into many different things. soon, this batch will be tu 

96
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:58,056
into tires, and that's when the synthetic rubber will really hit    the road.

>> narrator: cocoa beans are the primary raw material for making   chocolate 

98
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:23,282
they come from the fruit of the cocoa tree, native to central  

99
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:28,152
the ancient mayans would grind them to make a special beverage   for marr 

100
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,490
other rituals. today, cocoa is cultivated in

00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:38,163
countries in the tropic. these cocoa beans from   c

without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or   

103
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:47,572
farming cocoa organically requires meticulous care and  

104
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:53,979
with grafting techniques to help establish disease-tolerant tree   varieties. 

105
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:59,584
the farmer cuts a budwood, a young branch about to bud, from a healthy, p 

106
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:05,190
grafts it onto a sucker growing from the base of a tree which is   either dise 

107
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:10,662
unproductive. she cuts a slot at the top of the sucker, then wraps a    

108
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:15,000
strip around the budwood to hold in moisture until the graft takes.      

109
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:22,740
next, she cuts a pointed end on the budwood and inserts it into the slot she made in the    

110
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:28,480
then she binds the union and covers it with a plastic bag.  

111
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:34,886
against two potential extremes, dehydration and excessive rain,   which cau 

112
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:41,960
if the graft takes, the union seals itself in a month or even sooner.      

113
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:47,299
strategic pruning strengthens the tree and keeps it growing  

114
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:54,439
to maintain and harvest. before long, flowers begin to  

115
00:12:54,441 --> 00:13:00,178
tiny beetles pollinate the flowers, after which tiny    

116
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:15,993
begin to emerge. the pods grow and grow...    

117
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:20,531
when the color transformation is complete, they're ripe for   

118
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,203
there are many varieties of cocoa trees, with pods of    

119
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:31,877
it generally takes about five months from first blooms to pod    maturity. 

120
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,682
come harvest time, they collect only the pods which are   u

if a pod isn't fully ripened, the cocoa beans inside will be

00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:04,242
the pod rind is a little over an inch thick.  it's rou

127
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:39,878
cover them for four to six days. as heat under the cover builds

away. the color and chemical composition of the beans    

130
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:57,695
and they become less acidic and develop a chocolaty taste.   

131
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:04,368
beans. workers spread them out on big

produce one kilogram of chocolate.
