narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:31,963
steel --
the original heavy metal...

5
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:37,568
apple juice --
from the tree to the glass...

6
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,236
aircraft landing gear --

7
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:43,174
what you really need
to score a touchdown,

8
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,909
and cosmetics --

9
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,547
we'll tour a factory where they
make it up as they go along.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,454
they call superman
"the man of steel"

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,790
because, flying
and x-ray vision aside,

12
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,261
he could bend solid steel
with his bare hands.

13
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,729
thanks to its
legendary strength,

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,000
steel is used for everything
from bridges and skyscrapers

15
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,203
to household appliances.

16
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,679
steelmaking usually begins
with a pile of scrap metal.

17
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,680
using this 11-ton electromagnet,

18
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,617
scrap iron --
composed of crushed car bodies,

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,954
electric appliances, cans,
and other steel scraps --

20
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,421
is gathered up.

21
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,293
this powerful magnet is able
to lift 5 1/2 tons of metal.

22
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,664
about 83% of this scrap will be
transformed into bars of steel.

23
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,368
this metal is then dumped
into a basket

24
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:49,106
which, by itself,
weighs 35 tons.

25
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,243
the basket can hold
up to 65 tons of metal.

26
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,513
and now they're going
to melt the metal.

27
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,314
this furnace reaches
a temperature

28
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,785
of 3,000 degrees,
hot enough to liquefy the metal.

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,190
it is heated by three electrodes
and by four natural-gas burners.

30
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,059
the contents of the basket
are dumped into the furnace.

31
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,663
here, the pieces of metal
come into contact

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,131
with liquefied steel,

33
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,800
which always remains
at the bottom of the furnace.

34
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,603
there's a reaction,
and an aeration system draws out

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,873
the smoke that's produced.

36
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,477
at this high heat,
the 66 tons of metal

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,480
will melt in about 60 minutes.

38
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,550
then the cover is placed
on the furnace.

39
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,622
this liquid is composed
of impurities

40
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,759
that rise to the surface
when the metal becomes molten.

41
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,230
at this stage, a workman
draws a sample of steel

42
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,766
to determine
its chemical makeup.

43
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,437
and now they make use
of a supersonic oxygen lance.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,640
this lance blows oxygen
into the molten steel.

45
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,176
this reduces
its carbon content,

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,314
homogenizes the mix, and speeds
up the melting process.

47
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,318
a ladle is positioned
beneath the furnace.

48
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,387
the molten steel
will be transferred

49
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,655
from the furnace
into this ladle.

50
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,359
the molten steel easily pours
into the ladle.

51
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,212
the ladle weighs 60 tons and
holds 127 tons of molten steel.

52
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,016
an overhead crane capable
of lifting 200 tons

53
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,752
carries the ladle
filled with steel.

54
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,154
additives are introduced

55
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,423
in order to obtain
the correct steel tone.

56
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,594
here, the electrodes are taken
out of the furnace ladle.

57
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:59,169
a workman now opens the pouring
nozzles of the distributor.

58
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,307
it is equipped
with four pouring holes.

59
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:06,177
the molten steel
runs into molds.

60
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,247
it cools very quickly
and begins to harden.

61
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,117
steel billets are produced

62
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:17,788
in lengths varying
from 15 to 35 feet.

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,591
the billets are then cut
to the desired length

64
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,893
with a natural-gas torch.

65
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,931
a pouring identification number
is marked on them

66
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,201
with a wax crayon.

67
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,603
the difference between
a steel billet

68
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,673
and the nearly finished
flattened product is clear.

69
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:39,343
flattening of the billets
remains to be done.

70
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,813
before flattening begins,

71
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,416
billets are placed
in the furnace to be reheated

72
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:49,553
for 2 hours at 2,000 degrees.

73
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,957
water jets
cool the billet ejector.

74
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,231
the billets are placed
on the flattener,

75
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,367
where powerful rollers
compress them.

76
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:08,438
this operation gives the billets
the required shape and size.

77
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,041
water-cooled rollers
crush the billets.

78
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,779
some billets go from a thickness
of 5 inches down to 1/2 an inch,

79
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,783
while other reduce from 6 inches
down to 3/4 of an inch.

80
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,987
at the end of production,

81
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,323
bars move along at a speed
reaching 22 miles per hour.

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,458
once they reach
their required dimensions,

83
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,261
the bars must be cooled.

84
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,064
this cooling bed allows the
steel bars to cool uniformly.

85
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,468
a total of 440,000 tons
of steel bars

86
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:41,305
are made at this plant
each year.

87
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,482
narrator: dump thousands
of apples into a giant press,

88
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,620
apply several tons of pressure,
and what do you get?

89
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,622
apple juice, of course.

90
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,492
and good thing it's made
on such an enormous scale,

91
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,227
when you consider
how many people

92
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:07,665
drink gallons of this
popular juice every year.

93
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,372
here at rougemeau,
they make apple juice

94
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,308
mainly from mcintosh apples.

95
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,176
some 90% of juice production

96
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,645
is done at harvesttime
in october.

97
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,848
a conveyor transports apples
to an inspection location.

98
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,984
apples tumble in the reverse
direction of the conveyor belt

99
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,855
so that wet leaves
and undesirable materials

100
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,790
adhere to the belt.

101
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:40,530
the apples are stored in silos
for several hours.

102
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,200
so the apples don't get
too bruised in their descent,

103
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,270
they're slowed down
in this stepped chute.

104
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,806
juice making can now begin.

105
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,408
now they wash the apples.

106
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,209
since they use some apples

107
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,745
that have already fallen
to the ground,

108
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,747
this first water bath must
eliminate pebbles.

109
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:01,218
a shower of cool water
completes the washing process.

110
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,422
the apples are cut into little
pieces in this grinder

111
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,889
and produce gratings.

112
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,825
enzymes are added,
which break down

113
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,693
the cellular structure
of the fruit,

114
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,897
allowing for maximum
juice extraction.

115
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,632
next, the gratings
are transferred

116
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,433
into maceration reservoirs,

117
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,770
where they'll stay
for 60 to 90 minutes.

118
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,038
then they extract the juice.

119
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,509
the gratings are pumped
into a powerful hydraulic press.

120
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:29,179
inside the press, filter sleeves
hold back the skins,

121
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,682
seeds, and stems of the apples.

122
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,787
quality control is strict.

123
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,723
at each stage of the process,
they draw off samples of juice

124
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,325
to evaluate its quality

125
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,861
and to make sure
that fabrication parameters

126
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,696
are well adhered to.

127
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,600
the juice is filtered
a first time.

128
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,003
the very smallest
undesirable particles

129
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,639
are held back by this sieve.

130
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,743
the fabrication process
continues.

131
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,546
juice flows
from one stage to another

132
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,949
via these immense reservoirs.

133
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,619
the next step
will be pasteurization.

134
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,889
juice enters this exchanger
at 72 degrees

135
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,291
and is heated up to 190 degrees,

136
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,361
then cooled back down
to 122 degrees.

137
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,164
enzymes are then added
to hydrate the pectin

138
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,365
and facilitate
the second filtration.

139
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,168
this is
the ultra-filtration process,

140
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,505
where filter membranes
with microscopic pores

141
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,708
retain the smallest
of particles.

142
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,644
the apple juice
is now perfectly filtered.

143
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,379
its clarity is verified,
as well as its flavor,

144
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,851
color, and natural
fruit-sugar content.

145
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,187
since juice
is produced in october,

146
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,522
it has to be conserved
throughout the year.

147
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,591
a portion of the production
is stored

148
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,326
in this sterile warehouse area

149
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,929
to await being bottled
during the year.

150
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,134
each reservoir can hold 29,000
gallons of filtered juice.

151
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,738
no preserving agent is added.

152
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,380
now we move to the next stage,
the filling of containers.

153
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,552
these little drinking containers

154
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,821
are filled
at the rate of 100 a minute.

155
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,324
the containers
are then hermetically sealed.

156
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,767
two little sprays of hot glue
are applied to the containers.

157
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:34,004
this secures the straws
to their sides.

158
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:43,180
another automated production
line fills bottles with juice.

159
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,450
they circulate in a row
on this conveyor.

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,989
bottles are washed
and disinfected

161
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,525
with hydrogen peroxide
in this white, sterile room.

162
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,728
then they're rinsed
with sterile water

163
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,365
before being carried
to the filling location.

164
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,870
each minute,
120 bottles are filled

165
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,738
with pasteurized apple juice

166
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,343
and sealed with a cap
in a sterile environment.

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,620
bottles are then labeled
and sent to shipping.

168
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,756
between 20,000 and 40,000 tons
of apples

169
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,625
are transformed
into juice yearly.

170
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,027
thanks to its perfect
preservation,

171
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,065
consumers can enjoy this juice
at any time of the year.

172
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,043
narrator: what goes up,
they say, must come down,

173
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,379
and when what's up
is an airplane,

174
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,650
you need dependable landing gear
to get you back down safely.

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
this critical piece
of aircraft equipment

176
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,323
is the product
of expert mechanics

177
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,893
combined with sophisticated
technology.

178
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,270
this heavy piece of steel

179
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,473
is the undercarriage
of a kc-135r airplane.

180
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,276
a landing gear comprises
a central shaft

181
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,011
to which an axle and wheels
are attached.

182
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,947
they begin machining the shaft.

183
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,284
this digital lathe machines the
exterior surface of the part.

184
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,153
sprays of water and oil
cool the part,

185
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,690
which heats up due to friction.

186
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,759
they're now going to pierce
the shaft.

187
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:39,229
this drill head will ream out
the inside of the shaft.

188
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,631
alignment of the head
must be perfect,

189
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:45,836
so they're cautious
with their work.

190
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,806
the perforating gets under way.

191
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,110
turnings from the cutting
are saved,

192
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,178
and these will be sold
to foundries,

193
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,047
where they'll be recycled.

194
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,119
we see here the cutting tool

195
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,922
used to pierce the holes
in the landing gear.

196
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:12,196
to perforate the part, very
sharp cutting tools are used.

197
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,735
here, they complete
an attachment hole.

198
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,338
the hole is enlarged
on its sides,

199
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,740
as required
by this machine tool.

200
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,245
the part is cooled with a mix
of water and oil.

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,548
cutting is completed,

202
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,151
and the hole is now cleaned out
with compressed air

203
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,621
so that they can proceed
with a visual inspection.

204
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,623
here, three pieces are rough-cut

205
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,625
at the same time
by this machine.

206
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,693
because they'll be used
in aviation,

207
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,897
these pieces have to be machined
to perfection.

208
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,100
the machining of the shaft
is now almost completed.

209
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,505
this deburring unit polishes
the machine's surfaces

210
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,508
with a compressed-air tool
and sandpaper discs.

211
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,912
and now they have to verify
the dimensions of the parts.

212
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,382
this digitally controlled
machine has three axes

213
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,552
and does the verification
with extreme precision.

214
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:16,926
here, another unit allows
for the machining of parts

215
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,296
with greater dimensions.

216
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,404
this facility also reconditions
used landing gears,

217
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,874
such as this one
from a boeing 707.

218
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,276
they strip off the paint
with a sandblaster

219
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:37,814
to verify the condition of
the parts with great precision.

220
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,818
and here are those parts
stripped clean.

221
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,621
but a visual inspection
is not enough.

222
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,291
they can detect cracks by
magnetic-particle concentration.

223
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,093
they magnetize the part,

224
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,563
and any cracks will become
visible under ultraviolet light.

225
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,899
now it's time
for the shot-metal procedure,

226
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,769
where they spray steel balls
onto the metal's surface

227
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,772
to increase its resistance
to fatigue.

228
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,042
before repainting the part,
they first plate it.

229
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,978
the part is immersed
for 10 minutes in cadmium,

230
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,980
which forms
a protective coating on it

231
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,583
that will resist corrosion.

232
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,852
then the part is quickly soaked

233
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,988
in a weak concentration
of chromic acid.

234
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:26,263
water, agitated by air jets,
cleans away the chromic acid,

235
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,466
and the part is rinsed
with water another time.

236
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,804
the part is now baked
at 375 degrees over 23 hours

237
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,142
to remove hydrogen induced
during the plating process.

238
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,547
then the part is immersed in
liquid nitrogen at -200 degrees

239
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,684
before it's inserted
in order to reduce its size.

240
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,788
this collar is easily pushed
on with a hydraulic jack.

241
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,494
reheating the collar makes it
return to its normal size.

242
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,497
now the different components
and the leakproof joints

243
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,234
are inserted into the piston.

244
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,304
the shock-absorber tube
goes into the piston.

245
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,308
this part absorbs the shock
stresses when an aircraft lands.

246
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,444
the piston is now slid
into the cylinder,

247
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:19,849
and they verify that
the shock absorber is leakproof.

248
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,920
fabrication finishes with paint
baked in an oven.

249
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,056
some six to eight months
are required

250
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,724
to make a new landing gear

251
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:32,629
and between six to eight weeks
to recondition a used one.

252
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,473
narrator: perfume, eye shadow,
foundation, lipstick --

253
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,275
they're all products
of a huge industry

254
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,413
driven by our desire for beauty.

255
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,948
well, "how it's made"
is about to show you

256
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,417
how they manufacture cosmetics,

257
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,821
and we assure you,
we're not making this up.

258
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,164
during archaeological
excavations,

259
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,165
mummies were discovered
wearing makeup,

260
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,968
the egyptian technique
of enhancing eye contours

261
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,138
with antimony, lead,
and metal oxides --

262
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,974
all toxic, lethal substances.

263
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,444
greek women also
adorned their cheeks

264
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,246
with a dye made from lead oxide.

265
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:27,517
in 1910, florence nightingale,
under the name elizabeth arden,

266
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,053
would change
the whole makeup picture,

267
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,924
launching the vogue for
cosmetics without toxic agents.

268
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,869
cosmetics have been in existence
since the dawn of time.

269
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,606
there are many ingredients
that make up a cosmetic formula.

270
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,542
the industry heavily uses
iron oxides

271
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,146
to color its products in
a multitude of attractive tones.

272
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,282
before moving into fabrication,
each ingredient

273
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,152
must be carefully
and accurately weighed.

274
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,422
these raw materials
are often dry, such as powder,

275
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,026
but can also be liquid
and even oil or wax.

276
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,561
every ingredient
will have first been approved

277
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,297
by the quality-control
laboratory.

278
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,168
a single formula may contain
over 50 ingredients.

279
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,244
the other essential ingredient
is water.

280
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,846
the water used
in making cosmetics

281
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,450
is first purified
by an inverse-osmosis system.

282
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,186
when it meets strict
company standards,

283
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,156
it is put
into a stainless-steel tank.

284
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,194
depending on the complexity
of the recipe,

285
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:49,666
between 4 and 10 hours of work
are needed to make up a product.

286
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,002
let's begin
with a bubble-bath recipe.

287
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,672
a part of the recipe is prepared
in an adjoining container

288
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,141
to make certain ingredients
more soluble.

289
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,276
a stainless-steel
screw propeller

290
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,346
mixes all the ingredients
thoroughly.

291
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,553
all along
its fabrication processing,

292
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,222
the product will be subjected
to many tests.

293
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,825
here, an acid-based
neutralization-reaction test

294
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:20,497
is performed
with a color indicator.

295
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,632
the bubble bath
has to be colored.

296
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,634
a fragrance
and a color are added,

297
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,505
for in this recipe,
the final product will be mauve.

298
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,710
before the filling process,

299
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,046
the quality-control
and microbiology laboratories

300
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:41,451
make sure that the product meets
strict quality standards.

301
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,253
now it's on to the next step.

302
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,655
this filler
can simultaneously fill

303
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,258
up to 12 700-milliliter bottles

304
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,461
at a steady pace
of 50 per minute.

305
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,730
the fill level
is adjusted electronically.

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,866
capping remains to be done.

307
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,469
this capper positions and
tightens the caps automatically.

308
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:04,107
urethane rollers apply
the precise tightening force.

309
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,413
the bottles now pass beneath
a sealer via induction,

310
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,549
which generates
a magnetic field,

311
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,751
heating the metal piece
placed in the cap.

312
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:20,357
when hot enough, it welds itself
onto the neck of the bottle.

313
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,160
another product made here
is the peeling mask.

314
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,296
the mask is poured
into this funnel,

315
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,298
whose end is attached
to the tube-filler pipe.

316
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,702
the product descends
via gravity.

317
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:37,274
the filler pours the peeling
mask into 50 tubes each minute.

318
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:44,447
then, with heat and crimping,
the tube end is sealed,

319
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,318
and the tube
heads for packaging.

320
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:54,057
other products made here --
cologne and perfume.

321
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,059
the liquid is drawn
into the bottle by suction.

322
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:00,730
this rotating filler operates
with intermittent vacuum

323
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,265
to fill 50 bottles a minute.

324
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,268
bottles are positioned beneath
the 16 filling spouts

325
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:08,672
that seal their opening to allow
for the creation of a vacuum,

326
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,340
which draws in the product.

327
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,209
now atomizer pumps are inserted.

328
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,478
handling two bottles
simultaneously,

329
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,214
this machine seals the pump,

330
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,882
securing it around the neck
of the bottle.

331
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,352
we see the white sleeve
aligning the pump,

332
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,054
while the gray one
tightens the pump.

333
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,291
then there are the sprayers.

334
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,093
this machine
applies the spray stoppers

335
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,297
and, with a hammer, presses them
onto the pumps of the bottles,

336
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,832
which are now finished.

337
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,439
and one final product --
roll-on deodorants.

338
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,175
this machine
fills 115 bottles a minute,

339
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,510
handling 8 bottles at a time.

340
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,313
a filling stem pours the product
into the bottle,

341
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,983
and here they place the roller
ball at 115 per minute.

342
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,919
then the ball is lightly pressed
into the cavity

343
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,589
in which it turns freely.

344
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,125
this plant makes
over 1,200 different products

345
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:06,229
and yearly sells 32 million
items per year.

346
