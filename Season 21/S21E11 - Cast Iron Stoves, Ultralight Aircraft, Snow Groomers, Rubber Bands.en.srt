narrator: cast-iron stoves have been adding warmth to people's l 

4
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,724
for more than three centuries.  

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,461
today there are new reasons to cozy up to this invention.  

6
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,196
it's had a major update.     

7
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,600
modern stoves burn wood more cleanly and efficiently,  

8
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:08,801
providing heat          

9
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,370
without the dirty fallout from the chimney.        

10
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,811
modern cast-iron stoves hardly resemble         

11
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:22,080
their smoke-belching, soot-spewing predecessors.    

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,617
the design creates a hotter fire,          

13
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,353
so it requires less fuel and releases little smoke.    

14
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,091
it all starts with a pile of iron scrap,    

15
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:37,530
things like old stoves, sinks, brake drums, and rotors.     

16
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:44,036
a magnetized crane transfers the scrap       

17
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,839
to a propane-fired preheater.  

18
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,577
12 minutes spent in the preheater      

19
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,847
removes moisture from the iron scrap.       

20
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,850
the scrap iron spills into a hopper       

21
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,087
that funnels it into an electric furnace.    

22
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,590
the temperature in the furnace  

23
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,193
is a blistering 2,700 degrees fahrenheit,    

24
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:12,798
and the iron melts into a fiery liquid.       

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,001
the furnace tilts to pour the molten iron     

26
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,671
into a ladle for transfer.    

27
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,347
next, they make the molds of the stove parts,       

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,951
using a mix of sand, clay, water, and coal.         

29
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:37,022
they blow the ingredients    
between the aluminum patterns.  

30
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:42,028
a hydraulic system squeezes the patterns together.      

31
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,365
the sand mix compacts and takes the shape of the patterns.    

32
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,635
they now have sand molds.    

33
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,375
the molten iron arrives     

34
00:02:56,377 --> 00:03:00,312
and flows into a channel leading to the molds.      

35
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,314
as the liquid metal cools,    

36
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,650
it solidifies into the shape of the mold.           

37
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:10,790
a vibrating conveyor shakes and breaks the sand molds    

38
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:15,861
to reveal the cast-iron stove parts.    

39
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,931
a worker knocks off unwanted bits,          

40
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,434
and then it's into a blast cleaner.    

41
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,004
inside the blast cleaner,    

42
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,808
steel grit bombards the stove parts         

43
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,010
to remove remnants of the sand molds        

44
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,879
and expose the metal.      

45
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:43,222
essentially it blasts the dirt off, and they come out clean.  

46
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:47,092
an employee grinds the edges of the metal stove parts.    

47
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,028
he blends in the line created  

48
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,631
where the two parts of the mold came together during casting.  

49
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,836
it takes 40 parts to make one woodburning stove,      

50
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,574
and each one is cast in a sand mold made from a pattern.            

51
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,313
next, a worker drills threads for the bolts          

52
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,250
that will hold all the parts of the stove together.      

53
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,859
once the surface of the parts has been prepped,        

54
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:25,997
they spray an enamel coating onto them and bake it on.    

55
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,800
a laser then cuts out a steel heat shield       

56
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,403
for the back of the wood stove.             

57
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:35,074
the intricate cuts are computer driven.       

58
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:43,482
an employee bends the heat shield to fit the stove.  

59
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,352
next, a worker packs a kind of mortar         

60
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:49,154
into a silicone mold of the firebox.         

61
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,491
the table its on vibrates to settle the material      

62
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,559
and eliminate air pockets    

63
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,764
so the firebox will be able to withstand high temperatures.          

64
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,499
the shape of the firebox     

65
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,035
is crucial to the stove's energy efficiency,        

66
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,840
and so are the holes      
that have been molded into it.  

67
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,041
these strategically located holes          

68
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,577
will introduce fresh air     

69
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,980
to burn gases that would otherwise go up in smoke,    

70
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,551
preventing energy loss and pollution at the same time.              

71
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,721
the parts have all been fabricated,    

72
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,257
and they're ready to put the pieces together.   

73
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,993
they assemble the stove from the bottom up.       

74
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,463
they bolt the parts and seal the joints to make them airtight.  

75
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,767
the assembly takes about an hour.          

76
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,074
this cast-iron stove is now ready           

77
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,945
to keep these fires burning for many years to come.     

78
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,898
narrator: an ultralight aircraft      

79
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,234
is a lightweight, motorized flying machine     

80
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,902
that looks like a hang glider.  

81
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,638
hang gliding inspired the invention of ultralights   

82
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,105
back in the late 1970s.     

83
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,840
the idea was to create      

84
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,978
a slow but affordable method of motorized flight       

85
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,381
subject to minimal aerospace regulations.      

86
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,220
they're called ultralights or microlights.         

87
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:33,058
this made-in-france 2-seater  
model weighs about 485 pounds.  

88
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,659
to be classified as an ultralight         

89
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,862
by the international air sports federation,      

90
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,266
takeoff weight can't exceed 990 pounds     

91
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:44,570
and minimum speed can't surpass 40 miles per hour.        

92
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:47,339
the wing surface, called the sail,         

93
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,876
is made of a sturdy polyester-based material     

94
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,144
treated with a special coating  

95
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,880
that protects it from the sun's ultraviolet rays.              

96
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,149
they unroll different colors of this fabric          

97
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,819
onto a cutting table marked with patterns       

98
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,622
for the four separate sail sections.          

99
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:08,360
they staple the fabrics to the table           

100
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,163
to hold them steady while tracing the patterns.   

101
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,433
once they finish tracing, they cut out the pieces,     

102
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,436
then connect them with double-sided adhesive tape              

103
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,838
to position them correctly for sewing.           

104
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,507
they reinforce select areas   

105
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,410
with adhesive-backed polyester mesh fabric.      

106
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,115
then a sewer stitches the pieces together       

107
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,984
with high-strength, u.v.-resistant thread.      

108
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,788
in this first stage of the sewing process,      

109
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,792
they stitch together 1/4 of the sail at a time.    

110
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:43,061
in the second stage of sewing,  

111
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:47,066
they sew together the top and undersurfaces of each side.              

112
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,134
then, in the final stage,    

113
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,938
they stitch the right and left together.   

114
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,074
in another part of the factory,            

115
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:58,544
the body of the aircraft begins taking shape.       

116
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:01,213
it's called the trike because it sits on three wheels,             

117
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,814
like a tricycle.         

118
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,416
they build it in sections,    

119
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,486
welding together        
several stainless-steel tubes.  

120
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,823
after the sections receive a baked-on coat of paint,    

121
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,891
workers assemble them to each other          

122
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,827
around the fuel tank.      

123
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:19,164
the 17-gallon tank is made of lightweight polypropylene,  

124
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,834
a type of plastic that's u.v. resistant      

125
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,236
and impact resistant.      

126
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:28,173
once the trike is fully assembled,       

127
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,175
they mount the three small wheels,     

128
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,345
similar to those on motorized scooters.      

129
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,990
next, they bolt a 100-horsepower gasoline engine,         

130
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,326
similar to a full-sized motorcycle engine,        

131
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,395
to the back of the trike.    

132
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,070
on the front of the trike, they install pedals       

133
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,672
for propelling the craft on the ground...         

134
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:05,344
and a motorcycle-style plastic console with windshield.     

135
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:08,247
the console houses the instrumentation panel.    

136
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,153
they mount the radiator in the center of the trike,   

137
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,288
cover it with foam and fabric,  

138
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,423
then install a pair of upholstered seats   

139
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,759
for pilot and passenger.     

140
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,029
then they protect the engine with a plastic housing.     

141
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,931
they mount an aluminum- and-carbon-fiber propeller    

142
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:31,036
on the shaft of the gearbox connected to the engine.     

143
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,604
now for the wing.        

144
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:36,241
its main structure is made up of hinged aluminum tubes     

145
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,243
which fold for transport.    

146
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,845
aluminum is lightweight and rustproof,          

147
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,581
which is essential for flight.  

148
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:47,252
they slip the sail over the tubing, then unfold the wing.  

149
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,790
thin aluminum tubes provide crosswise structural support.  

150
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:57,329
a system of cables keeps    
the wing in the open position.  

151
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,664
another system of cables, called the corset,        

152
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,468
manipulates the billowing of the sail.    

153
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,537
this enables the pilot to alter the aerodynamics    

154
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,474
to increase or reduce speed.   

155
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,276
under the wing, they install the a-frame,    

156
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,578
the ultralight's steering mechanism.       

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,415
the pilot manipulates the    
a-frame with a horizontal bar,  

158
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:21,553
changing the trike's body position under the wing.  

159
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:25,958
the last step is to bolt the  
front of the trike to the wing  

160
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,162
and hook up the safety backup cables.    

161
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,564
the pilot steers the ultralight           

162
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,567
by weight-shifting with the a-frame bar,      

163
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,636
tilting the trike toward the front to descend,   

164
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,373
to the right to veer right, and so on.            

165
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,311
typical cruising speed is around 75 miles per hour.   

166
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,512
with an open cockpit,      

167
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,648
air temperature and oxygen levels        

168
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,585
limit how high an ultralight aircraft can fly.              

169
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,254
maximum altitude is about 3,300 feet,       

170
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,323
high enough for a thrill ride  

171
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,960
yet still low enough for a spectacular view.     

172
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,476
narrator: after a busy day of skiing and snowboarding,   

173
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,678
ski slopes get worn down     

174
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,548
and develop ruts, bumps, ice, and bare spots.       

175
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,618
ski resorts typically refresh the slopes overnight       

176
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,222
by grooming the snow with specialized track machines.            

177
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:33,058
by morning, the runs are as good as new.   

178
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,830
a snow groomer is like a bulldozer on tracks,      

179
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,899
except instead of pushing dirt, it pushes snow.         

180
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,771
it uses grooming implements   
mounted to the front and back.  

181
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:47,372
to build a snow groomer,     

182
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,375
workers begin by aligning front and rear frames      

183
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,977
with the vehicle's main frame  

184
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,713
with the help of positioning jigs.       

185
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,184
then a welder gets to work.   

186
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,853
first, he tacks everything together.  

187
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,722
then, with a mechanical lift,  

188
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,325
he raises and tilts the tacked frame         

189
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,860
to gain access from various angles.       

190
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,663
after welding on additional parts,        

191
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,064
including 10 axles,       

192
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,600
they prime and paint the frame.             

193
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:19,938
then a mechanic installs    
a heavy-duty suspension system  

194
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,140
designed to automatically adapt              

195
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,343
to the type and shape of terrain,           

196
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,811
maximizing traction.       

197
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,214
next, he greases the 10 axles  

198
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:33,285
and installs a wheel hub and bearings on each one.    

199
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,822
he then mounts the wheel,    

200
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,692
tightening the bolts to a specified torque      

201
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:45,230
to ensure optimal performance and durability.         

202
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:53,839
meanwhile, another mechanic installs the hydraulic hoses.  

203
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,641
these control the grooming implements     

204
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,044
and the sprocket on which each track turns.    

205
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,715
then he connects the hoses to the main hydraulic valve.   

206
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,250
at another workstation,     

207
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,186
a mechanic assembles the diesel engine,        

208
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,189
the transmission, and four hydraulic pumps.    

209
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,393
two of these pumps drive oil to the hydraulic motors,     

210
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:17,329
which propel the vehicle forward and backward.      

211
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,731
the two others pump hydraulic fluid       

212
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,934
to operate the implements and the cooling system.     

213
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,670
they lower this assembled unit into the frame          

214
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:29,073
and make the required electrical and hydraulic connections.    

215
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,077
meanwhile, another team prepares the next unit,          

216
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,346
starting with the cooling system,     

217
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,748
two powerful fans which cool the engine      

218
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,616
and hydraulic fluid.       

219
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,019
next, they install the exhaust system        

220
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,488
and two batteries to power the engine.       

221
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,758
they mount this assembled unit above the transmission      

222
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,893
and make            
all the necessary connections.  

223
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,229
they lower the cab onto the frame,         

224
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,232
connect more electrical and hydraulic lines,       

225
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:58,503
and fill all systems with their respective fluids.  

226
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,772
the vehicle now undergoes extensive testing        

227
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,173
in a dynamometer,        

228
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,242
which operates the engine and hydraulic components     

229
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,446
at maximum capacity.       

230
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:11,516
if all systems perform according           
to engineering specifications,  

231
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,652
the vehicle gets the go-ahead  

232
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,921
to receive the snow-grooming implements.  

233
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,756
the rear implement is a tiller,             

234
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,593
which breaks up the snow into small particles       

235
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,129
and shapes narrowly spaced parallel lines          

236
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,798
on the trail surface.      

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,067
a powerful, built-in hydraulic motor     

238
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,803
spins the steel-toothed rotors at speeds            

239
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,473
of up to 1,350 revolutions per minute.           

240
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,208
this ensures even grooming throughout.    

241
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,347
the groomer's tracks are made of ultra-durable steel.     

242
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,083
a mechanic guides the edge of each track      

243
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,685
onto a high-strength urethane sprocket        

244
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,555
bolted to the rear of the frame              

245
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,558
while another mechanic slowly drives the vehicle forward    

246
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,961
to pull the track over the wheels.         

247
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,099
then they clamp the two ends together             

248
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,370
and join them with giant hinges, closing the loop.        

249
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,109
it's time to mount the snow-grooming implements.  

250
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,378
they attach the tiller to the rear mechanism,      

251
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,513
which carries the hydraulic connections    

252
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,382
for the implement's onboard motor.          

253
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:23,121
they attach a blade to     
the identical front mechanism.  

254
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,389
the blade plows snow       

255
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,524
and sculpts features such as half-pipes,       

256
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:30,462
those giant, u-shaped bowls of snow      

257
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:35,133
in which freestyle skiers and daredevil snowboarders ride.              

258
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,069
for safety,           
the cabin has a steel skeleton  

259
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,138
with roll-over protection features.            

260
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,207
a specially designed joystick  

261
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,876
gives the driver precision control        

262
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,611
over the blade and tiller.    

263
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,147
the state-of-the-art electronics include three computers,     

264
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,616
which enable the driver     

265
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,819
to select and adjust      
different functions and modes,  

266
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,755
all of it displaying on a color monitor.       

267
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,424
the vehicle never sinks into the snow    

268
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,229
because its weight is optimally balanced on the tracks.     

269
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,164
this 22,000-pound snow groomer  

270
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,234
actually exerts less pressure on the snow           

271
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:12,504
than a single person does on foot.             

272
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,652
narrator: the rubber band was invented in england     

273
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,055
in the middle of the 19th century.       

274
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,924
the key to its success, of course, is flexibility.    

275
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,860
a rubber band can be stretched  

276
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,228
around items of various shapes and sizes   

277
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,597
to hold them together,      

278
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,599
so in the rubber-band industry,            

279
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,335
the possibilities for expansion are numerous.          

280
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,141
rubber bands come in handy for a whole bunch of things.   

281
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,809
if you have a bunch of anything,            

282
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,012
a rubber band can keep it together.      

283
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:58,749
production of rubber bands starts with natural rubber.   

284
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,552
these spongy slabs have been made          

285
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,420
from the sap of rubber trees.  

286
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,756
natural rubber has greater elasticity      

287
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,824
than the synthetic kind,     

288
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,494
making it a better choice for rubber bands.        

289
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,831
a worker measures and pours rubber processing oil      

290
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
into a kneader machine.     

291
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,436
he adds powdered pigment --   
in this case, yellow and white  

292
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,907
for a pale yellow shade.     

293
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,309
he feeds several rubber slabs  

294
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:29,247
to the kneader's spiral-shaped jaws.       

295
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:34,719
the spiraling blades intersect to break up the rubber      

296
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,056
and blend in the other ingredients.      

297
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:43,127
the kneading process generates 
heat which softens the rubber,  

298
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,897
making it easier to form into dough.       

299
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,102
the kneader spits out rubber-dough chunks.       

300
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,675
next, a giant rolling pin transforms the dough       

301
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,211
into wide, thin pieces.     

302
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,616
he slices the strips and bundles them.        

303
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,018
in this form,          

304
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,887
it will be easier to control the weight of the rubber     

305
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,724
in relation to chemicals that are added next.       

306
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,561
they roll the rubber       

307
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,163
with a precise amount of sulfur and other chemicals       

308
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,167
that strengthen the rubber and make it more elastic.    

309
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,907
they then roll the rubber very thin.            

310
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,710
a worker twists and cuts it into small bundles        

311
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,914
that fit into the opening of an extruding machine.     

312
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,051
it forces the still-warm and malleable rubber       

313
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:44,456
through dies to shape it into long, hollow tubes.     

314
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,258
the extruder injects air and talcum powder into the tubes              

315
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,661
to keep the walls from collapsing         

316
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:52,263
and sticking together while warm.           

317
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,266
the tubes cool down in a trough of water,      

318
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:59,136
and they deflate as the injected air dissipates.           

319
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,339
next, these aluminum poles will serve as molds       

320
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,075
for the tubes during curing,   

321
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:08,546
giving them the correct shape and diameter.          

322
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,218
the worker slides the tubes onto the molds.         

323
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,089
the talcum powder injected into the tubes during their extrusion            

324
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,291
will also act as a release agent,       

325
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,762
keeping them from sticking to the molds during curing.   

326
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,865
they load the tubes into a steam oven,        

327
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,235
and the intense heat vulcanizes the rubber            

328
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:34,272
to boost its tensile strength and elasticity.         

329
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,178
out of the oven,         

330
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,847
workers inject air between the tubes and the molds,     

331
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:47,619
making it easier to peel the now-vulcanized tubes off.  

332
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:54,592
they rinse the rubber tubes to remove talcum-powder residue.            

333
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,762
there's so much that the water turns milky white.        

334
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,734
they hang the rubber tubes to drain away some of the water.             

335
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,605
by the time they're ready    
to cut, they're a bit too dry,  

336
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,809
so a worker splashes water onto them.            

337
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,210
with the tubes moistened,    

338
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,013
the next operation will run more smoothly.     

339
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,817
he feeds several tubes at once to a rotating blade       

340
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,418
which carves them.        

341
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,956
this creates elastic bands that are exactly the same width.             

342
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,826
in this case, that's 1.5 millimeters,     

343
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:31,296
an average thickness for a rubber band.        

344
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:37,902
with this system, they can cut 1/2 a million rubber bands    

345
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,704
in an hour.           

346
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,508
it doesn't take long for the inventory to pile up.  

347
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,443
there are millions of rubber bands here.      

348
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:51,750
a worker scoops them up and   
examines each one for defects.  

349
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,122
once approved, all that's left is the packaging.        

350
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,058
the rubber bands ride a conveyor            

351
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,595
that releases them in increments into plastic bags.        

352
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,865
it has taken about three hours  

353
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,734
to produce this bag of rubber bands.         

354
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:14,539
on a normal day, this factory  
generates 40 million elastics.  

355
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,943
that's a lot by any stretch of the imagination.       

356
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,424
