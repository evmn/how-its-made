00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,785
narrator: a traffic intersection,    

4
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,855
a hollywood movie set, the outside of an airplane -- 

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,924
it's hard to imagine any common ground among them  

6
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,327
until you flip a switch, a light switch.        

7
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,597
traffic lights, movie lights, and aircraft lights      

8
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,734
are all made of the same type of special glass.       

9
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,636
it's called technical glass.  

10
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,476
borosilicate glass has a low thermal expansion  

11
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,878
and is very durable.      

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,347
it's used           
in high-temperature applications

13
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,850
and when abrasion resistance is important.         

14
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:32,090
it begins with a mix of silica 
sand and chemicals called batch.

15
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,358
workers shovel the batch    

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
and recycled glass, called cullet,         

17
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,029
into a pot furnace, where they melt for two days. 

18
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,432
a variety of colorants are added

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,302
to make hundreds of different colors.      

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,974
next, it's on to the molding process.    

21
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,308
workers heat a ring      

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,044
and transfer it to the top of a mold.     

23
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,181
then they twist and turn a stick called a punty     

24
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,850
to gather some melted glass  

25
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,419
and carefully string it in the mold.          

26
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:06,791
a plunger squeezes the molten gob into shape.   

27
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,863
the glass solidifies in seconds.

28
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,598
this glass lens is used    

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,635
as a landing-light cover on an aircraft.        

30
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,941
they extract it from the mold for a quick inspection.    

31
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,744
any imperfections, and it gets recycled.     

32
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,612
if the lens is acceptable,   

33
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,150
it's held in a forming device to finalize the shape.     

34
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,636
the burner maintains the proper
temperature of the ring.    

35
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,908
once formed, the lenses    
are cooled in an annealing oven,

36
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,178
which relieves unwanted stress in the glass.         

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,380
this circular mold       

38
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:04,048
makes theatrical and landscape lighting.    

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,118
again, a gob of molten glass is dropped in the mold,    

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,388
and the plunger is depressed, forming the lens.       

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,856
heat-resistant tongs      

42
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,660
enable workers to handle the hot lenses.   

43
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,729
red and yellow lenses need a high-temperature anneal    

44
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,130
for the color to appear.    

45
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,932
this is called striking.    

46
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,801
back on the molding line,   

47
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,469
special tools are used     

48
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,739
to ensure this aircraft lens maintains its shape.      

49
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,742
a quick spin on the light wheel
illuminates any defects.    

50
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,881
after a trip through the annealing lair,  

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,718
the lenses are ready for further processing.    

52
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:48,293
the molding process for larger lenses can be more complicated.

53
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:52,631
this large convex lens requires
several gobs of molten glass  

54
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,701
placed carefully on top of one another.     

55
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,778
the plunger enters into the molten glass,     

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,179
forming the lens.       

57
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,316
deep ridges located in the plunger of the mold   

58
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,720
create the circular prisms on the glass lens.       

59
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,920
within seconds,        

60
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,324
the lens is ready for extraction
and inspection.        

61
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,193
using heat-resistant mitts,  

62
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,462
workers scrutinize the glass from every angle,       

63
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,233
checking for small fractures or imperfections in the glass. 

64
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,341
next, they inspect for flatness

65
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,877
using a paper-thin plastic feeler.        

66
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,478
if it slides underneath,    

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,681
the lens is warped and unacceptable.        

68
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,350
they check the glass thickness in many locations,       

69
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,587
using a calibrated thickness gauge.        

70
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,960
any major defects, and they discard the lens.   

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,496
in the factory's finishing shop,

72
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,700
they use a diamond saw to slice away excess glass   

73
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,034
around the periphery.     

74
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,903
a special sanding belt is used 

75
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,306
to smooth the surface to perfection.         

76
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,047
then, with a cloth buffing wheel,  

77
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,449
they polish the glass to a shine.          

78
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,652
at last, the final inspection. 

79
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,455
using calipers, they measure the lens's ridged edges,    

80
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,857
called the flange,       

81
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,894
to make sure the dimensions are correct.          

82
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,933
producing such a colorful assortment of technical glass 

83
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,268
takes a lot of work,      

84
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,404
but at least there's light at the end of the tunnel.    

85
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,818
narrator: in the days before electricity,

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,419
doing laundry was just plain hard work.   

87
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,887
the first electric washing machines        

88
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,557
were little more than a bucket with a motor attached.     

89
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,959
fully automatic machines came about in the 1960s.    

90
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,094
but with rising concern for the environment,      

91
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,231
there are new designs that need
less water and electricity   

92
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,567
to get the dirty job done.   

93
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,840
most washing machines contain a circular tub     

94
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,174
to hold the laundry.      

95
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,710
but this model has a unique feature --    

96
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,846
a hexagon-shaped tub made from panels        

97
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,482
of laser-cut, perforated stainless steel.  

98
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,525
the operator separates the cut panels    

99
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,263
and places one on a bending machine called a press brake. 

100
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,866
it forces the panel against a die,         

101
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,133
bending the edge.       

102
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,470
the operator repositions the panel for the next bend,  

103
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,774
repeating this until      
the six-sided shape is complete.

104
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,818
then an assembler attaches a hinged door         

105
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,553
to the tub's opening.     

106
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,522
that's where the laundry goes in.            

107
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,160
this inner tub is contained by another outer tub.     

108
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,162
to assemble it,        

109
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,497
a welder sets a stainless steel plate    

110
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,967
onto a welding fixture.    

111
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,969
then he places the tub's main frame      

112
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:22,707
and slides in another steel plate to close it up.  

113
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,510
he clamps the tub firmly in place        

114
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:30,248
then spot-welds it on each side
so the pieces hold together.  

115
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:41,326
next, he takes the tub over to a machine called a seam welder.

116
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,662
there, an electrode wheel travels   

117
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,862
all along the tub's edge,   

118
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,665
welding together the front and back panels   

119
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,699
to the main frame.       

120
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,876
there's still more welding to do

121
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,678
with the use of a robotic welding arm    

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,982
to build the machine's 24x27-inch steel base.     

123
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,289
a concrete counterweight mounted on the outer tub's side

124
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,892
prevents the machine from shaking too much     

125
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,360
when it's in operation.    

126
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,764
next, an assembler attaches a pressure tube and a sump hose

127
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,166
to draw the used water out of the machine.      

128
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,870
he seals both tubes with a watertight adhesive.  

129
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,042
now he can install the suspension struts     

130
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,312
that support the outer tub, one at each corner of the base.

131
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,921
a single electric motor powers the whole machine.   

132
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,390
it's set on the machine's underside   

133
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,225
on an adjustable pivot shaft. 

134
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,531
with the motor in place,    

135
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,201
assemblers now turn over the completed outer tub     

136
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,135
and lower it into position on its base.          

137
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,471
they connect the support struts
on all four sides       

138
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,872
and then push the tub     

139
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,142
to make sure the struts align properly         

140
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,677
and keep the machine balanced. 

141
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:15,353
next, the inner tub is set into the outer tub.   

142
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,089
workers insert a stainless steel shaft    

143
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,624
right through both tubs.    

144
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,362
a strip of watertight foam is set             

145
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,431
along the outer tub's perimeter
to seal it           

146
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,100
before workers install a plastic bezel    

147
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,437
that keeps water from splashing
out of the machine.      

148
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,711
next, assemblers install the drive pulley    

149
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,748
onto the shaft that supports the inner tub.         

150
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,586
a drive belt connects the motor
to the pulley,         

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,988
which rotates the shaft    

152
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,190
and the inner tub that it supports.       

153
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,993
now they slide a stainless steel outer cabinet

154
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,128
onto the base that covers the tubs.     

155
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,597
it contains a control board,  

156
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,798
the brain of the washing machine.    

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,135
the assembler sets the lid into place,    

158
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,404
and the machine is complete.  

159
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,739
the control-board wiring    

160
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,940
is located on the underside of the lid.          

161
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,476
that's also where the valves  

162
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,145
that dispense detergent, bleach,
and softener are.       

163
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,813
before it leaves the plant,  

164
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,817
a member of the quality-control
team tests it out       

165
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,485
with a load of soiled laundry. 

166
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,486
according to the manufacturers,

167
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,156
the unique shape of the inner tub is the key  

168
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,892
to making this a lean, green washing machine        

169
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,361
that requires less water, less detergent,        

170
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,631
and less energy to get the job done.      

171
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,366
there's been a lot of water under the bridge        

172
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,902
since the days of those first machines.    

173
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,538
they've sure come a long way. 

174
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,716
narrator: the playing card traces its roots        

175
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,852
back more than 1,100 years to 9th century china.     

176
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,455
since then, generations young and old   

177
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,058
lay down their true colors in a variety of games,     

178
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,327
each as unique as the traditional 52-card deck

179
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,164
and as timeless as the four famous suits.   

180
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,603
whatever the hand,       

181
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,540
a winning combination of technical features     

182
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,010
makes these playing cards durable and cheater-proof.   

183
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,813
industrial humidifiers control the moisture level   

184
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,348
of the card stock.       

185
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,619
this prevents the cardboard from drying out and warping.  

186
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,353
technicians regularly monitor 

187
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,756
the cardboard's temperature and humidity          

188
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,024
by inserting a flat probe   

189
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,161
4 inches from the top of the 3,000-sheet stack.   

190
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,499
card stock arrives from the paper mill ready-made --  

191
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,436
two layers of cardboard bonded with colored glue.   

192
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,705
this construction makes the playing cards    

193
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,574
impossible to see through.   

194
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,509
before making printing plates, 

195
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,645
a technician checks the artwork
for the deck,         

196
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,315
then prints out a low-resolution sample    

197
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,651
to confirm the sequence and layout are correct.    

198
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,121
there's absolutely no room for error,           

199
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,523
so she carefully double-checks every card           

200
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:10,862
for suit, sequence, color, and layout.          

201
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,131
a signature on this sticker  

202
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,267
confirms these cards are good for print.       

203
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,470
the next step is to make a digital proof.        

204
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,972
this printer's internal laser 

205
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,543
heat-transfers dots of colored foils onto a clear film.    

206
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,213
these dots perfectly reproduce the content and color     

207
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,414
of each card.         

208
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,552
next, a laminating machine bonds the exposed films    

209
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,955
onto a sheet of the same cardboard     

210
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,889
used to make the cards.    

211
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,625
this produces a printed proof 

212
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,961
showing exactly what the finished playing cards   

213
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,696
will look like.        

214
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:51,302
here, graphic artists adapt  
hand drawings of the face cards,

215
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,339
adding color and a touch of regal class wherever needed.

216
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,044
the next step is to make the printing plates.  

217
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,646
a computer-guided laser    

218
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,982
etches the design into the polymer surface    

219
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,249
of the printing plate.     

220
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,451
entirely automated,      

221
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,189
this machine produces 30 plates an hour.       

222
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,866
to set up for a print run,   

223
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,402
workers pour several cans of thick cyan ink       

224
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,338
into the ink duct.       

225
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,341
the three other colors -- same setup.          

226
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,276
when the printing press gets rolling,         

227
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,212
each fountain will disperse ink evenly    

228
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,415
via 16 rollers.        

229
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,484
feeders transport the cardboard sheets one by one

230
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,687
into the press.        

231
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,893
each printing plate is mounted on a rotating drum. 

232
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,562
rollers transfer the ink onto the plate,        

233
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,431
which then transfer onto a rubber blanket,     

234
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,168
which presses against the passing cardboard 

235
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,036
as it moves through the press. 

236
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,239
at the end of the machine,   

237
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,642
the printed sheet is flattened and stacked.   

238
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,578
they feed the same sheets back through the press,    

239
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,448
this time upside-down.     

240
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,985
the sheets now move      

241
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,687
through a cutting machine called the combi,       

242
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,056
where rotating blades divide the sheet into columns,    

243
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,293
then into individual cards.  

244
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,669
the cards get grouped into decks.          

245
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,106
then the deck heads into what 
they call the cornering station.

246
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,612
a die descends and, in one fell swoop,    

247
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,481
cuts off all four corners.   

248
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,817
next, a robotic arm nudges each deck        

249
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,553
onto a conveyor destined for the cello wrapper.     

250
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,958
grippers pull a cellophane reel downwards  

251
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,893
while a knife then cuts the film.      

252
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,296
a heated bar descends and seals the film,      

253
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,232
which forms an envelope.    

254
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,100
with a simple pull,      

255
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,971
the red tear strip removes the wrapper.      

256
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,642
the traditional english deck  

257
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,913
is the international standard for games such as poker.    

258
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,849
but there are many more types of playing cards.       

259
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,118
this set of spanish cards, for example,          

260
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,221
has no numbers, just symbols. 

261
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,927
whether at the casino blackjack table        

262
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,597
or the kitchen table,     
playing cards are the real deal.

263
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,348
narrator: a crossbow is a modern bow and arrow   

264
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,883
that you shoot like a rifle.  

265
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,953
it's popular for both target shooting and hunting.  

266
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,955
with a rifle, you can shoot from 200 yards away.      

267
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,958
but using a crossbow is more of a challenge.    

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,696
you have to be at least four times closer to your target.  

269
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,836
a crossbow consists of the bow and the stock.   

270
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,372
the bow shoots the arrow, while the stock        

271
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,309
houses the trigger and the aiming scope.     

272
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,847
a plate of fiberglass is the starting point     

273
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,248
for the bow's limbs,      

274
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,450
the two curved arms that pull back         

275
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,386
and release to shoot the arrow.

276
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,521
a vacuum holds the plate steady

277
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:34,258
as a computer-guided grinder does some initial shaping.   

278
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,197
workers measure the plate with micrometers        

279
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,866
to ensure it meets strict specifications.     

280
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,402
this is a special type of fiberglass.         

281
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,804
the fibers all run in the same direction,     

282
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,375
meaning they can bend repeatedly
without weakening over time.  

283
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,346
workers mount the plate on a computer-guided cutter.  

284
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,882
it carves out the limbs with a high-pressure water jet --  

285
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,619
the most precise way to slice fiberglass.      

286
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:11,762
each plate yields four limbs --
two bows' worth.        

287
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,232
the severed fibers make their surface rough,   

288
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,366
so a little polishing is in order.          

289
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,436
the limbs go into a vibrating tub      

290
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,173
filled with ceramic stones that rub against the limbs,  

291
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,108
wearing down the coarse fibers.

292
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,711
now the limbs are ready for decoration.        

293
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,179
the design is printed on plastic film.        

294
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,449
this machine uses heat and pressure          

295
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,585
to transfer the design.    

296
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,388
the next bow component is called the riser.      

297
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,390
they machine it out of aluminum,

298
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,893
then jazz it up with an ink transfer.     

299
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,262
to assemble the bow,      

300
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,798
they bolt a limb to each side of the riser.   

301
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,266
it acts as a spacer,      

302
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,136
separating the limbs so that the arrow can pass between them

303
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,604
when you shoot.        

304
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,145
the riser and limbs go into a press,        

305
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,348
which applies more than 660 pounds of pressure,    

306
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,618
bending the limbs into an arc. 

307
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,354
next, workers mount a set of aluminum pulleys      

308
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,355
on each limb tip.       

309
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:15,293
these are called compound cams.

310
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,294
next, the yoke.        

311
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,097
a yoke is a string with a loop on each end.    

312
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,167
they anchor one loop to one side of the limb tip,  

313
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,337
pass the other end       
through a loop on a steel cable,

314
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,040
then anchor it to the other side.       

315
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,641
this forms "y" shape      

316
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,044
that distributes pressure on the limb evenly.      

317
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,180
they repeat the same process  

318
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,715
with a second yoke on the other limb.       

319
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,651
now for the bowstring.     

320
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,052
on each limb,         

321
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,789
they attach the bowstring end to one side of the cam.    

322
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,659
then they anchor the cable coming from the yoke      

323
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,661
to the other side.       

324
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:59,002
next, two rubber silencers go onto the bowstring.     

325
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,271
when you shoot,        

326
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,607
these silencers absorb the string's vibration,    

327
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,075
reducing the sound.      

328
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,478
these components make up what's known as a compound bow.

329
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,615
this design enables the bowstring         

330
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,350
to propel the arrow farther.  

331
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,686
now the bow is finished and ready for testing.     

332
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,422
this scale measures how much strength it takes   

333
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,558
to draw the bow.        

334
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,430
elsewhere, the stock is coming together. 

335
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,365
first, the trigger mechanism. 

336
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,303
it undergoes extensive testing in a specially designed device 

337
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:36,307
that applies air pressure to simulate the bowstring tension.

338
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,578
they pull the trigger six times
to ensure it fires properly.  

339
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,913
then they apply the safety catch.       

340
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,583
and with a strap to get maximum strength,    

341
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,984
they pull some more.      

342
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,653
this makes absolutely sure   

343
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,787
the trigger won't fire accidentally    

344
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,390
in the safety position.    

345
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,795
after attaching a connecting rod
that fits in the bow's riser, 

346
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,531
they install the trigger in the barrel.         

347
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,936
then they bolt these components
into the stock housing.    

348
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:09,273
they attach a bridge and rail on which the scope will mount. 

349
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:13,377
now they test the trigger again
to check the installation.   

350
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,485
connecting the crossbow's two sections is simple.    

351
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,822
you insert the stock's rod into a slot in the riser    

352
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,690
and tighten the mounting bolt. 

353
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,558
then you attach a foot stirrup.

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,829
to cock the bow, you stand the crossbow on the ground,  

355
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,497
put your foot in the stirrup, 

356
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,299
and pull the bowstring upward 

357
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,901
until it locks into the trigger mechanism.  

358
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,739
then you pick up the crossbow, aim, and fire.         

359
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,913
