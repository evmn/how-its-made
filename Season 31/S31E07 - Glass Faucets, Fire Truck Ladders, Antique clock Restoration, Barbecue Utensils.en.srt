narrator: glass faucets elevate
indoor plumbing to an art form.

10
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,192
the glass is hand-crafted in a range of shapes and patterns 

11
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,394
for visual effect.       

12
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:04,330
metal components are fused into the glass    

13
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:07,132
to deliver one of the necessities of modern life,

14
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,734
running water.         

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:14,606
glass faucets are about both form and function.    

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,675
glass faucets have a delicate beauty,       

17
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,811
but they're stronger than they look.        

18
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,946
the glass is very thick,    

19
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,417
allowing the faucets to hold up to heavy use.    

20
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,154
making a glass faucet starts with chunks of clear glass.  

21
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,624
a glass worker loads the glass 

22
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:35,761
into an oven at 2,190 degrees fahrenheit.  

23
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,098
another worker selects black and white billets of glass   

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,701
to add stripes and patterns to the clear glass.      

25
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:46,305
he preheats them so the glass won't shock and fracture    

26
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,907
when exposed to higher temperatures.    

27
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,242
with a metal rod,       

28
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,445
he gathers a clump of the clear glass       

29
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,246
from the main oven.      

30
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,847
with the chunk of glass,    

31
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,517
he picks up the preheated white cylinder,        

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,921
simultaneously exposing both to the flames.         

33
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,990
this process makes the glass flexible.           

34
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,193
using a curved wood tool,   

35
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,395
the glass worker gathers the clear glass at the base  

36
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,731
and wraps it around the white billet,       

37
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,667
encapsulating it.       

38
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,871
he attaches the other end of  
the glass to a second metal rod.

39
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:24,676
this allows the glass to stretch
as he pulls it across the room.

40
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,413
the glass is now over 35 feet long       

41
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,214
and pencil-thin.        

42
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,084
it starts to cool and solidify immediately    

43
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,486
as it's set down.       

44
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:37,355
the glass workers tap the glass
against a piece of metal    

45
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,827
to break it into 8-inch pieces called canes.  

46
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,029
they shape another piece of clear glass         

47
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:48,367
by rolling it on a metal table called a marver.        

48
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,036
the glass worker blows through the metal rod,         

49
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,638
causing the glass on the end to bubble.           

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,312
it will eventually become the faucet and two handles.  

51
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:06,318
he adds a layer of black molten glass to the bubble.  

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,586
another glass technician    

53
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,990
arranges the striped canes on a grooved iron plate    

54
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:15,261
and heats them with a torch.  

55
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:18,597
meanwhile, a glass worker rolls
the hot glass bubble      

56
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,534
onto the canes, which stick together.     

57
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,669
then it's back into the furnace,

58
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:28,207
and the white-striped canes melt into the black bubble.  

59
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,876
next, the craftsman rolls the glass        

60
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,612
across the marver repeatedly. 

61
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:38,083
he pinches the canes at the top,
closing them around the bubble.

62
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,752
the glass is reheated to keep it pliable       

63
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,422
as the craftsman continues to form it.     

64
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,092
the craftsman transforms the bubble     

65
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,694
into a hollow glass tube    

66
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:54,833
then elongating the tube to its desired length.     

67
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,568
using a pincer-leg tool,    

68
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,572
he forms the end into a round handle shape   

69
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,640
while another glass worker   

70
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,376
applies heat to the glass with a torch.         

71
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,246
this keeps the glass pliable. 

72
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,849
he then creates a hole for a piece of metal hardware. 

73
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,320
then he applies molten glass to the metal hardware     

74
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:17,856
and inserts the hardware into the round faucet handle. 

75
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:22,327
this cuts the handle free from the rest of the glass.  

76
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,063
using a forming tool,     

77
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:29,067
the craftsman refines the shape of the glass.    

78
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,671
next, he preheats a metal mold.

79
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,941
this stops the hot glass tube from fracturing        

80
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,812
as he bends it around the mold to shape it into the faucet.  

81
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,215
once the faucet has taken shape,

82
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:51,223
it's ready to go into the annealing oven.    

83
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,226
the glass is placed in the oven
at a low temperature      

84
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,228
and then cooled.        

85
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,500
this process removes stresses and strengthens the glass.   

86
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,036
meanwhile, using high-pressure water   

87
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,438
that contains fragments of garnet,      

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,840
a craftsman cuts steel trim rings        

89
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:14,180
and a display plate for the showroom.       

90
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,449
next, the craftsman installs the glass faucet        

91
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,984
on the display plate      

92
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,987
by threading a nut to the faucet valve.      

93
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,391
he installs the trim rings at the base of the handles   

94
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,926
and assembles them to the display plate      

95
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,795
using the hardware that's been fused       

96
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,065
to the inside of the glass.  

97
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,800
the craftsman uses a rag    

98
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,336
to clean the faucet      
of any fingerprints and smudges.

99
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,006
finally, construction is complete.          

100
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,810
this unique glass faucet is ready to make a statement.

narrator: short fire trucks can easily access tight spaces 

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,894
around the scene of a fire.  

104
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,629
that's because they're lighter 

105
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,165
and can carry more water and equipment.         

106
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,034
however, it's difficult for smaller fire trucks    

107
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,436
to support the weight of long ladders.        

108
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,839
to compensate, manufacturers have built    

109
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,910
longer ladders on shorter trucks.       

110
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:21,113
this 108-foot-long ladder can be mounted         

111
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,715
on a single rear-axle fire truck.     

112
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,585
typically, a ladder longer than 75 feet      

113
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,189
requires a tandem-axle truck to support its weight.     

114
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,991
the secret to the design of this ladder         

115
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,128
is that it's lighter, stronger, and durable.     

116
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,396
the components are cut     

117
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,866
from sheets and tubes of high-strength steel.    

118
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,603
using a press brake, the machinist bends the parts, 

119
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:50,342
verifying the accuracy of each bend.         

120
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,611
once all the components are prepped,          

121
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:58,216
the parts are welded together, then smoothed.         

122
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,019
this welded part is the turntable base.     

123
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:04,756
it rotates the ladder 360 degrees          

124
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,627
and provides a platform for  
the firefighter at the controls.

125
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,430
this is the torque box.    

126
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,766
it supports the aerial pedestal

127
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,302
to which both the ladder and turntable are bolted.   

128
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:21,173
to construct the ladder, technicians weld tubular rungs 

129
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,710
to vertical side rails called base beams.       

130
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,511
they reinforce the rungs    

131
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,314
with diagonal tubes called k-braces,        

132
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,786
which provide lateral structural strength.  

133
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:38,457
welders fuse steel tubes between
the base beam and the handrail 

134
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,394
to provide structural support. 

135
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,930
next, an inspector from an independent testing company 

136
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,535
examines the integrity of the welding.        

137
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,871
once the ladder passes inspection,       

138
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,140
it's put through a shot-blasting chamber,    

139
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,677
which pummels the surface with steel pellets.      

140
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,280
this process removes metal impurities    

141
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,016
and preps the surface for painting.         

142
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,352
craftsmen apply two coats of primer,      

143
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:09,888
one top coat of color, then two clear coats of paint, 

144
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,227
sanding by hand between each application.   

145
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,763
next, a three-part anti-skid treatment      

146
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,432
is applied to the turntable surface --  

147
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:25,036
first, a coat of glue, then an abrasive material,   

148
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:32,377
then a coat of sealant, which is
baked in an oven for 90 minutes.

149
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,315
the ladder rungs are covered with snap-on non-slip covers  

150
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:39,451
made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic.            

151
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,386
the ladders are stacked    

152
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:45,990
