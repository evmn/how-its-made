            narrator:           
       in racecar engines,      

5
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,122
     excess lubricating oil     
       is stored in tanks       

6
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,924
      rather than oil pans.     

7
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:02,194
   this prevents the oil from   
 sloshing around during the race

8
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,930
        and causing drag        
       on the crankshaft.       

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,666
         with less drag,        
    performance is increased.   

10
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,803
       so these oil tanks       
 are part of a winning strategy.

11
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,341
        racecar oil tanks       
     come in various shapes     

12
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,544
    and sizes in order to fit   
    into difference vehicles.   

13
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,480
but their purpose is the same --

14
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,748
       to keep excess oil       
        out of the engine       

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,418
      to boost performance.     

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,754
        each tanks starts       
     with a computer design.    

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,891
      the engineer maps out     
     the precise dimensions.    

18
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,493
   they input the measurements  

19
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,162
        into computerized       
       machining systems.       

20
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,797
       this first one cuts      
    a long piece of aluminum    

21
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,566
      into smaller pieces,      

22
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,703
  creating blanks to make parts 
      known as tank rings.      

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,773
 a vertical milling tool sculpts

24
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,243
      a recess in the blank     
    to seat an o-ring sealer.   

25
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,712
      then, switching bits,     

26
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,115
      the machine contours      
    the outside of the blank,   

27
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,851
         taking it from         
      rectangular to round.     

28
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,789
        other tools carve       
   a large hole in the center   

29
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,524
 and profile the inner diameter 

30
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,593
        so that the part        
     will mate to the tank.     

31
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,996
      this ring is designed     
         to be removable        

32
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,598
       to access the tank       
        for maintenance.        

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,802
     here's the blank before    
      and after machining.      

34
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,739
  like powerful cookie cutters, 

35
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,208
    computerized punches cut    
       out numerous parts       

36
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,343
     from an aluminum sheet.    

37
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,945
 they include the oil tank body,

38
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,648
            the top,            
   and other assembly pieces.   

39
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,353
        to make the tank        
        body cylindrical,       

40
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:37,089
     a worker turns a crank     
   to curl it around a roller.  

41
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,826
         this tank body         
     is called the wrapper.     

42
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,228
        he drills a hole        
       in the bottom cone.      

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,629
    the hole is for the line    

44
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,233
  that returns lubricating oil  
     to the racecar engine.     

45
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,701
     using a thin band saw,     

46
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,638
        he trims the cone       
      to fit the tank ring.     

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,176
       with a device known      
   as a hydraulic tube bender,  

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,947
 a worker shapes a piece of pipe
      to a precise radius.      

49
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,720
     this pipe will be used     
   to vent air into a chamber   

50
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,789
  at the side of the oil tank.  

51
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:20,132
      he trims the ends of      
 the vent tube using a band saw.

52
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,872
  a worker welds the tank ring  
       to the bottom cone,      

53
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,608
      creating a thick seam     
       all the way around.      

54
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,147
     he then seals the seam     
 of the cylindrical wrapper body

55
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,285
       and welds a top cap      
     to a deaerating baffle.    

56
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,621
    air will rise through it    
        and vent it into        

57
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,155
   and out of a side chamber,   

58
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,391
  leaving only oil in the tank. 

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,899
      he slides the baffle      
     into the wrapper body.     

60
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,233
    he inserts the vent tube    

61
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,402
      in a hole on the side     
          of the tank.          

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,709
     he fits an adapter ring    
   to the upper lip of a tank   

63
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,011
        and taps it down        
      with a rubber mallet.     

64
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,652
     he welds the baffle and    
  filler neck to the tank body, 

65
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,387
       and then assembles       
      the air vent chamber      

66
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,922
   to the side of the oil tank  

67
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,458
       and welds it to it.      

68
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,529
   moving to another station,   
        a worker now taps       

69
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,598
   perforated plastic inserts   

70
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,468
          into holes in         
      the air vent chamber.     

71
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,136
  these inserts will both vent  

72
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,639
       and filter the air       
         from the tank.         

73
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,409
    he fits a rubber sealing    
    ring around the fill neck   

74
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,879
     and screws the cap on.     

75
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,014
           he applies           
    the adhesive-back decals    

76
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,217
           to the tank          
     for branding purposes.     

77
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,621
   he caps the oil inlet tube   

78
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,291
    to keep contaminants out    
        during shipping.        

79
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,028
  he turns the tank upside down 

80
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,199
      and installs a valve      
 on the bottom of the vent tank.

81
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,437
   he inserts a rubber o-ring   

82
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,905
    into a groove on the base   
        of the tank wall        

83
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,209
     and tucks it into place    
       all the way around.      

84
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,848
         after equipping        
    the fittings on the cone    

85
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,317
     with caps for shipping,    

86
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,986
      he installs the cone      
     on the base of the tank    

87
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,355
       and screws the ring      
         tightly to it.         

88
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,992
       accessing the tank       
     for maintenance reasons    

89
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,995
 will mean unscrewing this part.

90
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:38,003
         that completes         
     this racecar oil tank.     

91
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,604
 hooked up to a system of pumps,

92
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,473
    these tanks will receive    
        and dispense oil        

93
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,611
      sparingly to improve      
       engine performance.      

94
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,915
   they've been well-equipped   
   for life in the fast lane.   

95
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,762
            narrator:           
    the ancient greeks first    
   began beautifying interiors  

96
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,699
with ornate columns and moldings
      shaped from plaster.      

97
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,635
       decorative moldings      
  were a popular design feature 

98
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,372
 in much of europe from roughly 
    the 17th century onward,    

99
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,441
     with italian tradesmen     
         becoming famous        

100
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,910
        for their mastery       
         at plasterwork.        

101
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,181
           specialists          
   in traditional plasterwork   

102
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,250
  are a rare breed these days.  

103
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,651
 but that's who you need to hire

104
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,120
       to properly repair       
        plaster moldings        

105
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,856
       in a historic home       

106
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,458
       or to craft plaster      
     moldings from scratch.     

107
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,197
     to repair this damaged     
       ceiling medallion,       

108
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,798
    the plasterman first saws   

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,134
         and chisels off        
      the problem portion,      

110
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,738
  clearing a flat work surface. 

111
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,940
         then, he drives        
       and screws part way      

112
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,676
    to anchor the new portion   
           of molding.          

113
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,144
the heavier the plaster molding,

114
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,282
    the more screws you need    
        to hold the load.       

115
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,886
 another plasterman, meanwhile, 
      prepares the plaster.     

116
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,488
      the first ingredient      
       is lime compound --      

117
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,223
    a simple mixture of lime,   

118
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:10,228
also known as calcium hydroxide,
           and water.           

119
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,531
         he forms a well        
       with his scraper...      

120
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,770
       then fills the well      
         with a mixture         

121
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,639
 of roughly three-quarters water

122
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,475
         to one-quarter         
construction-grade bonding glue.

123
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,184
  he adds just the right amount 
      of plaster of paris,      

124
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,053
    which is powdered gypsum,   

125
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,457
     the same stuff they use    
 to make casts for broken bones.

126
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,196
       he takes his trowel      

127
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,332
      and thoroughly blends     
       the lime compound,       

128
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,202
          glue mixture          
      and plaster of paris.     

129
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,404
   when it has the consistency  
           of pudding,          

130
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,272
      the plaster is ready.     

131
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,008
    the plasterman does this    
           all by eye,          

132
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,880
 without ever actually measuring
      a single ingredient.      

133
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,749
   after applying bonding glue  
       to the repair area,      

134
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:09,287
  the other plasterman trowels  
       on lots of plaster.      

135
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,824
  then, he takes what's called  
    a circular running mold.    

136
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,894
       its profile is out       
    of the existing molding.    

137
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,497
    he runs it back and forth   
      over the wet plaster,     

138
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,600
 hence the term "running mold." 

139
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,370
   then, he carefully scrapes   
         away the excess        

140
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,507
    and runs a wet paintbrush   
          over the new          

141
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,775
and old portions of the molding.

142
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,646
    this makes the transition   
 between the two appear seamless

143
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:38,517
        and smoothes out        
       any imperfections.       

144
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,184
   to make the running molds,   

145
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,988
   he cuts out a cross section  
     of the existing molding    

146
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,590
    and traces it to produce    
     a sheet metal template     

147
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,860
     with the same profile.     

148
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,529
     then with that, he cuts    
       the shape in wood,       

149
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,266
         producing what         
       they call a stock.       

150
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,667
          after sanding         
        the stock smooth,       

151
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,003
he screws on the metal template.

152
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,872
        the wood backing        
       prevents the metal       

153
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,742
     from bending as he runs    
     it over thick plaster.     

154
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,813
       he screws more wood      
 to the stock to form a handle. 

155
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,482
     to make crown moldings,    
      the plasterman mounts     

156
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,886
        a track to guide        
        his running mold.       

157
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,155
   he checks for anchor screws  
      obstructing the path.     

158
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:23,094
 if he finds any, he drives them
 a bit further into the ceiling.

159
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,896
   he brushes on bonding glue   

160
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,898
         and lets it sit        
        for five minutes.       

161
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,406
    then, he begins applying    
  the plaster in sizable globs. 

162
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,845
      he passes the running     
     mold over the plaster.     

163
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,781
    he repeats several times    
    with additional plaster,    

164
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,317
       waiting 20 minutes       
       or so between coats      

165
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,855
    to let the plaster harden   
 just enough to hold the shape. 

166
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,324
    he applies the final coat   
            by hand,            

167
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,926
       filling in crevices      
       and imperfections.       

168
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,065
   then, he passes the running  
       mold one last time.      

169
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,400
         the wet plaster        
     molding takes anywhere     

170
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,670
   from 48 to 72 hours to dry,  

171
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:11,409
      depending on its size     
and on the humidity in the room.

172
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,945
    only when the molding is    
       completely dry can       

173
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,615
      the plasterman begin      
         the next step,         

174
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:21,085
   crafting the corner pieces,  
         called miters.         

175
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,821
   starting with larger knives  
          and scrapers,         

176
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,692
he uses the edge of the adjacent
      moldings as a guide,      

177
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,894
      adding some plaster,      
          sculpting it,         

178
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,964
    then removing the excess.   

179
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,432
 he keeps repeating these steps 

180
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,835
         until each side        
      of the miter matches      

181
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,437
 the molding it joins perfectly.

182
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,506
           it's a slow          
     and meticulous process     

183
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:45,976
       that takes patience      
       and an expert eye.       

184
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,846
      once he has perfected     
          the profile,          

185
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,180
      he refines the edges      

186
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,984
          with smaller          
      knives and scrapers.      

187
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,986
 finally, he blends the surface 
        with a wet brush,       

188
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,856
    rendering the transition    
           from miter           

189
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,592
  to molding visually seamless. 

190
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,929
          brand-new yet         
    distinctively old-world.    

191
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,540
 narrator: lemongrass isn't just
        a culinary herb.        

192
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,809
  oil distilled from the plant  

193
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,746
     is a popular ingredient    
    in soap and spa products.   

194
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:25,283
      used in aromatherapy      
for numerous therapeutic reasons

195
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,819
        with a fragrance        
    that's citrusy yet sweet,   

196
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,256
    lemongrass oil definitely   
     passes the smell test.     

197
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,360
        follow the scent        
         of lemongrass,         

198
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,097
       and the trail leads      
          to thailand.          

199
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,566
    it's here that the plant    
     is grown and processed     

200
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,168
     into an essential oil.     

201
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,370
        lemongrass oil is       
       the signature scent      

202
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,841
   in this part of the world.   

203
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,510
  after harvesting lemongrass,  
         workers select         

204
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,313
        the most fragrant       
     specimens and dry them.    

205
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,982
   they transfer these plants,  

206
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,919
         stalk and all,         
   to a distillation facility.  

207
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,522
  the heady aroma of lemongrass 
    will now be concentrated    

208
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,859
  into a potent essential oil.  

209
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,261
     workers unlock the top     
          of the still          

210
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,665
   and pour in chlorine-free,   
        deionized water.        

211
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,802
        once the still is       
        one-quarter full,       

212
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,805
    they add the lemongrass.    

213
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,408
     they stack the bundles     
    in a crisscross fashion,    

214
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,478
     creating gaps for steam    
        to pass through.        

215
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,647
they fill the still to the brim.

216
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,486
     it will take 66 pounds     
      of lemongrass to make     

217
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,891
       roughly 1 quart of       
 highly-fragrant essential oil. 

218
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,759
       they screw the lid       
       tightly to prevent       

219
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,229
        the loss of steam       
      during distillation.      

220
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,966
    they activate the still,    

221
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:52,036
     and it heats the water     
      to the boiling point.     

222
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,506
 steam rises through the plants 
     and picks up the oils.     

223
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,775
   it carries the oil vapor up  
         through a pipe         

224
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,377
      and into a condenser,     

225
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,913
      where the vapors cool     
  and return to a liquid form.  

226
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:08,853
    the liquid oil and water    
     drip out into a flask.     

227
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,254
    oil and water don't mix.    

228
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,524
  so the oil floats to the top. 

229
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,058
  and the water is drained off  

230
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,528
        and recycled back       
       into the distiller.      

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,931
  the technician then collects  
       the lemongrass oil       

232
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,468
 in a bottle one drop at a time.

233
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,403
  the lemongrass oil undergoes  

234
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,406
      a second distillation     
        in a laboratory,        

235
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,808
     using a more sensitive     
       piece of equipment       

236
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,878
            known as            
   a rotary vacuum evaporator.  

237
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
   the oil flows into a flask   

238
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:40,684
  that's spinning in a hot bath 
        of vegetable oil.       

239
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,620
  the evaporator pumps out air  

240
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,022
      and creates a vacuum      
          in the flask,         

241
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,425
 which lowers the boiling point.

242
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,428
      this prevents damage      
    to the delicate molecules   

243
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,764
           responsible          
    for the lemongrass scent.   

244
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,500
       the oil vapors rise      
       to a condenser coil      

245
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,302
      where they reliquefy,     

246
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,841
   leaving any residual water   
     and impurities behind.     

247
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,811
  the pure lemongrass oil drips 
     into a receiver flask.     

248
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,916
     as distilled lemongrass    
        oil is collected,       

249
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:15,653
 more flows into the evaporator 
    beaker for purification.    

250
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,861
     the distilling process     
         is continuous.         

251
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,329
        the rotary vacuum       
      evaporator processes      

252
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,499
      roughly 2 to 3 quarts     
    of fragrant oil per hour.   

253
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,005
  they store the lemongrass oil 
         in a cold room         

254
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:37,208
   with other essential oils.   

255
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,877
         like fine wine,        
      it must be kept cool,     

256
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,680
        or it could spoil       
      and ruin its bouquet.     

257
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,085
         when it's time         
    to formulate ingredients    

258
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,954
     for a cream or lotion,     

259
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,823
          a technician          
      blends lemongrass oil     

260
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,958
   with other essential oils.   

261
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,898
      just a few drops make     
   a difference you can smell.  

262
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,171
    they also use lemongrass    
         oil to enhance         

263
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,241
     the soothing qualities     
        of bath crystals.       

264
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,711
      the technician first      
        sifts epsom salts       

265
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,580
  and baking soda into a bowl.  

266
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,518
   he adds measured amounts of  
 the blend to sea salt crystals.

267
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,588
he stirs the ingredients by hand

268
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,859
      to evenly distribute      
        them in the mix.        

269
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,328
  the bath salts are now ready  
         for an infusion        

270
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,598
     of the double-distilled    
         lemongrass oil.        

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,601
   he adds it to a submixture   
     of other essential oils    

272
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,171
        to create a blend       
      with calming effect.      

273
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,476
     he pours the essential     
     oils onto the crystals.    

274
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,613
   and they soak into the tiny  
    spaces in the particles.    

275
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,549
       they then add some       
     more aromatic spice --     

276
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,551
        a freshly-ground        
      blend of lemongrass,      

277
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,587
turmeric, and other ingredients.

278
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,893
     he sprinkles the herbs     
        onto the crystals       

279
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,496
 and folds them into the blend. 

280
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:11,101
    the final effect will be    
 skin-tingling and rejuvenating.

281
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,237
incorporated into many products,

282
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,341
       lemongrass oil will      
       awaken the senses.       

283
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,854
   narrator: fly fishing uses   
  artificial lures called flies 

284
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,589
       rather than natural      
        bait like worms.        

285
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,725
         a fly is a hook        
       that has materials       

286
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,961
          like feathers         
     tied to it with thread     

287
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,396
 to trick the fish into thinking

288
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,798
        there's an insect       
     floating on the water.     

289
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,535
     to make your own flies,    
    you use a fly tying vise.   

290
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,473
       this fly tying vise      
     has pockets at its base    

291
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,075
     to hold your materials     

292
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,544
      and sturdy steel jaws     
      to grip the fishhook      

293
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:57,148
          while you tie         
    those materials onto it.    

294
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,083
       this machine makes       
         the sand molds         

295
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,487
           for casting          
     the metal pocket bases.    

296
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,155
        it deposits moist       
        sand into a flask       

297
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,625
   to form one half of a mold,  

298
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,228
    then rolls over the flask   
 to a pattern on the other side.

299
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,098
   after spraying the pattern   
    with a nonstick coating,    

300
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,435
  a worker sifts sand onto it.  

301
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,171
        then the machine        
      deposits sand on top      

302
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,107
        to form the other       
        half of the mold.       

303
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,509
     it compresses the sand     

304
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,578
     with roughly 4 1/2 tons    
     of hydraulic pressure.     

305
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,782
  the pattern sandwiched at the 
  center forms the mold cavity. 

306
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,918
 a machine separates the halves 
     to remove the pattern,     

307
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,589
  then puts them back together. 

308
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,459
      in the casting area,      
  workers heat pieces of bronze 

309
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:45,796
        to approximately        
    1,922 degrees fahrenheit,   

310
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,733
       melting them down.       

311
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,068
       they remove the pot      
    from the electric furnace   

312
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,806
and place it in a pouring shank.

313
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,408
   they pour the molten bronze  
     down a channel leading     

314
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,077
       to the mold cavity.      

315
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,946
    after about a half hour,    

316
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,748
   once the bronze has cooled   
         and solidified,        

317
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,285
     the flip the mold onto     
       a vibrating grate.       

318
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,290
    first the impact and then   
   the shaking break the mold.  

319
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,625
         the sand falls         
        through the grate       

320
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:19,096
   while four connected bronze  
   pocket bases remain on top.  

321
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,965
        once they're cool       
      enough to be handled,     

322
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,568
    a worker saws them apart.   

323
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,637
        the bases go into       
         a rotating drum        

324
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,974
  filled with tiny steel beads. 

325
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,375
       as the drum spins,       

326
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,579
  the centrifugal force throws  
  the beads against the bases.  

327
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,048
          this removes          
      all remnants of sand      

328
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,452
and polishes the surface smooth.

329
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,990
        the bases go onto       
        a computer-guided       
        milling machine.        

330
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,259
    it drills a hole to affix   
 the mounting piece for the stem

331
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,796
       that holds the head      
          of the vise.          

332
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,065
       the mill also cuts       
         a circular hole        

333
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,467
    at the center of the base   
      for a decorative coin     

334
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,271
bearing the manufacturer's logo.

335
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,540
      they finish the bases     
  with a clear protective coat, 

336
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,741
      a proprietary formula     

337
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,978
          that prevents         
   the bronze from oxidizing.   

338
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,418
   the vise's other parts are   
   machined out of metal bars.  

339
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,954
     here, a computer-guided    
        lathe transforms        

340
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:21,558
      two square steel bars     
      into the vise's jaws.     

341
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,862
     first, it cuts a small     
    half circle on one piece    

342
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:29,433
     for the cam that opens     
      and closes the jaws.      

343
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,069
     then, it turns the ends    
        to form a point.        

344
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,643
    the entire transformation   
            from bars           

345
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:44,048
          to jaws takes         
        about 90 seconds.       

346
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,385
      they place the jaws,      
   one at a time, into a press  

347
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,653
     and make a slight bend     

348
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:52,056
       to set the correct       
         spring tension.        

349
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,924
      they verify the depth     
           of the bend          

350
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,526
       with a specialized       
         measuring tool,        

351
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,929
       then send the jaws       
     to an outside facility     

352
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,799
          that applies          
   a black protective finish.   

353
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,003
    when the jaws come back,    
     workers assemble them.     

354
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:10,608
     first, they put the cam    
 through the semicircular hole. 

355
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,010
       then, they compress      
       the jaws in a vise       

356
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,881
      and slide an aluminum     
       head onto the back.      

357
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,616
          when the jaws         
      come out of the vise,     

358
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,685
      they expand to their      
       original position,       

359
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,087
       retaining the head.      

360
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,890
          workers apply         
   the manufacturer's sticker,  

361
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,225
 then thread a brass thumbscrew 

362
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,361
      that you turn to lock     
  in the position of the head,  

363
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:36,967
       which swivels left,      
     right, or 360 degrees.     

364
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,104
         they then bolt         
    the handle into the cam.    

365
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,572
  when you depress the handle,  

366
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,109
         the cam opens,         
        opening the jaws.       

367
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,843
on the reverse side of the jaws,

368
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,180
        they mount a clip       
    for holding the feathers,   

369
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:54,118
    yarn, or other materials    
  you're using to tie your fly. 

370
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,388
  then, they glue the logo coin 
      into the pocket base.     

371
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,126
    they install the mounting   
       piece for the stem,      

372
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,863
      then the stem itself.     

373
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,866
    a thumbscrew on the mount   
    holds the stem in place.    

374
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,905
  the head connects to a swivel 
     at the top of the stem.    

375
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,879
 the jaws securely hold the hook
     while you tie your fly     

376
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:26,150
  using anything from feathers  
  and fur to tinsel and beads,  

377
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,153
     creating your imitation    
     of an appetizing insect    

378
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,222
          or tiny fish.
