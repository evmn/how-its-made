narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,192
compact discs...

5
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,698
...mozzarella cheese...

6
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,270
...pantyhose...

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,177
...and fluorescent tubes.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,853
today there's virtually no limit

9
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,058
to the information
we can store on compact discs.

10
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,727
millions of bits of data
representing words, numbers,

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,399
music, graphics, or even video
can be stored on the discs.

12
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,537
let's take a "spin"
through a cd factory.

13
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,674
compact discs are copies made

14
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,609
from an original
glass master disc.

15
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,213
a thin plate of glass
is first placed in this unit,

16
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,548
which brushes the surface clean.

17
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,884
cleaning is done
with de-ionized water

18
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,619
and a small goat-hair brush.

19
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,754
the excess water is eliminated

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,291
by the rapid rotation
of the disc.

21
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,027
the disc then goes into
this surface analyzer,

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,730
where a laser beam inspects
the cleanliness of the surface.

23
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,842
at this stage,
two chemicals are applied --

24
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,912
a primer
and a photoresistant coating.

25
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:56,380
this operation is done

26
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,250
at a temperature
of 70 degrees fahrenheit

27
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,519
and lasts three minutes.

28
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,989
the disc is carefully retrieved
from the apparatus.

29
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:13,498
then the photoresistant coating
dries in an oven for 30 minutes.

30
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,071
this developer has two spouts.

31
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:25,142
one applies a de-ionized water,
and the other sprays a solution

32
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,744
to develop the data
etched on the glass.

33
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,548
the information
is now engraved on the disc.

34
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,418
then the disc is placed
in this metal-coating equipment.

35
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,087
the next step consists
of applying a thin coating

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,822
of nickel and vanadium.

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,626
this electroforming process
results in the master

38
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,927
from which discs will be made.

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,831
the etched glass is immersed
in a chemical solution

40
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,432
for 70 minutes.

41
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,603
then the plated piece is
removed, thus obtaining a die.

42
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,308
the die is sent off
for finishing.

43
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,645
it is stamped out
into the desired shape.

44
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,515
the excess material is recycled.

45
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,451
next, the compact discs
will be fabricated

46
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,852
from this master unit.

47
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:13,124
here we clearly see
the stamping-out technique.

48
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,698
the master is taken out.

49
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,737
a technician peels off the film

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,607
which protected the data
etched onto the die.

51
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,076
after a visual inspection,

52
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,245
the die is sent
to the pressing department.

53
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,284
the die is delicately installed
in the mold,

54
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,054
which will form compact discs.

55
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,295
discs are made
from a very special plastic

56
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,397
called "polycarbonate."

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,765
the mold is closed,

58
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,902
and liquid polycarbonate
is injected into the die.

59
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,039
it comes out as a small,
hard, translucent disc.

60
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,308
it is now ready
to be metal-coated

61
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,977
so it can be read
by a compact-disc reader.

62
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,381
a robotic arm lifts the disc
from the mold

63
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,917
and places it on these supports.

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,060
this metallizing process is
extremely short and very simple,

65
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,528
taking but a second.

66
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,530
it consists of covering
the plastic disc

67
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,066
with a very thin coating
of aluminum.

68
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,547
here we see the inside
of the mold,

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,616
where the aluminum coating
is applied.

70
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,892
in this facility,
almost everything is automated,

71
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,397
helping them produce over
100,000 compact discs per day.

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,571
protecting the surface
of the disc is essential,

73
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,107
so a coat of varnish is applied.

74
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,244
this also helps silk screening
stick to the surface.

75
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:20,051
ultraviolet lamps
quickly dry the varnish.

76
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,060
and here in the pressing room,
they apply the label.

77
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,396
this step is also very fast

78
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,334
since the machine prints
70 discs in 60 seconds.

79
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,602
once the silk-screening
is completed,

80
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,706
the finished discs leave
for packaging.

81
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,416
narrator: in a sandwich,
as a topping, or all by itself,

82
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,386
cheese has always been
a popular food.

83
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,356
this dairy product goes back
thousands of years,

84
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,760
and it's always started
with three basic ingredients --

85
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,563
milk, curds, and whey.

86
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,998
just ask little miss muffet.

87
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,438
like all cheeses,
mozzarella starts from milk.

88
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,440
to assure good milk quality,

89
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,577
the interior and exterior
of milk-transport trucks

90
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,979
must be washed
after being emptied.

91
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,714
a tank such as this one

92
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,384
can carry an average
of 8,000 gallons of raw milk

93
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,922
at temperatures between
37 and 39 degrees fahrenheit.

94
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,591
raw milk destined
for cheesemaking

95
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:38,329
contains 3.8% fats
and 3.3% proteins.

96
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,732
they store the milk and whey,
a milk by-product,

97
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,467
in these immense silos,

98
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,871
each with a capacity
of 59,000 gallons.

99
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,008
this milk separator
extracts surplus cream

100
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,743
to adjust the percentage of fat

101
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,279
according to
the type of cheese to be made.

102
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,481
fabrication begins
with this tank,

103
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,483
which feeds the pasteurizer.

104
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,952
pasteurization
sterilizes beverages

105
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,887
which can easily ferment.

106
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,756
milk samples are drawn off

107
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,093
to accurately determine their
milk-fat and protein content.

108
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,962
tests are carried out
in this laboratory,

109
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,764
where they impose controls.

110
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,500
these test tubes
contain milk samples

111
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,104
which will undergo
microbiological analysis.

112
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,606
milk quality must be impeccable.

113
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,781
this is a curdler with
a capacity of 6,600 gallons.

114
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,452
here milk and other essential
ingredients are introduced,

115
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:39,189
such as the enzyme, rennet,
that curdles the milk.

116
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,925
this mix must be well-stirred
and cooked.

117
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,396
the agitators are used to
cut the whey into little lumps.

118
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,732
this step takes
about 30 minutes.

119
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,100
the temperature of the tanks

120
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,136
depends on the type of cheese
they're making.

121
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,474
agitators
continue stirring the milk.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,742
once cooking is done,

123
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,679
the whey is pumped
onto tables to be drained.

124
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:05,749
it stays there
for about 25 minutes.

125
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:10,988
the solid and the liquid
are now well-separated.

126
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,166
the liquid we see draining
is called the "lactoserum."

127
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,170
the lactoserum
will be concentrated

128
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,306
and transformed
into milk by-products.

129
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,981
the water has been
almost entirely extracted,

130
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:40,751
and the cheese particles
are now sufficiently dry.

131
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,592
this large automated blade

132
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,062
then moves cheese particles
towards the next step --

133
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,631
the molder.

134
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,208
in the molder,
the cheese is cut up

135
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,744
before being carried
to the cooker --

136
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,013
the final processing step.

137
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,251
it appears that this mozzarella
has just the right texture.

138
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,968
the cheese finally arrives
at the molder,

139
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,570
which will give it
the proper shape.

140
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:39,443
each mold has a 5 1/2-pound
capacity and is rectangular.

141
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:44,515
brine, a salt solution, cools
and salts the cheese blocks.

142
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:49,086
the blocks are unmolded
and fall into a brine tank.

143
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,094
the cheese blocks will remain
in another brine solution

144
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,528
for a while.

145
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,532
then they're carried by
a conveyor towards another tank,

146
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:04,467
where they will be immersed
for 4 to 10 hours

147
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,838
at a temperature
of 36 degrees fahrenheit.

148
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,079
sprays of brine remove the foam

149
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,482
which forms
at the surface of the tank.

150
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,684
the 8,000 gallons of milk

151
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:23,287
we saw coming in by truck
at the beginning

152
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,558
have enabled the factory to
produce 1,400 blocks of cheese

153
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,226
in 8 to 12 hours.

154
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,030
finally, the cheese blocks
are vacuum-packed

155
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,399
and ready for shipment.

156
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:47,444
narrator: there was a time
when women wore silk stockings.

157
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,980
then came the invention
of pantyhose,

158
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,116
a cheaper,
more convenient alternative.

159
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,786
pantyhose are knitted
from strands of raw nylon.

160
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,523
it's no "stretch"
of the imagination to say

161
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:03,427
that when they go on sale,
there's usually a "run" on them.

162
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,935
making a nylon stocking
takes only a few minutes.

163
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,738
however,
it's a complex operation

164
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,608
that involves the knitting
of five to eight threads

165
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,009
as fine as a hair.

166
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,878
the threads,
usually nylon and spandex,

167
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,947
are used along with elastic.

168
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,750
sometimes polyester or cotton
are added.

169
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,686
the knitting machine
goes into action.

170
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,690
this one fashions a tube for
sheer stockings in 90 seconds.

171
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,359
in three minutes,
it makes a tube for tights.

172
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,230
its speed is adjusted according
to the product being made,

173
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,968
varying between 750 and 1,200
revolutions per minute.

174
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,839
once the tube is knitted, it is
sucked up and lands in a bag,

175
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,175
where it will be inspected.

176
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,311
more than 500 machines
share the work,

177
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,914
each making a specific model.

178
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,387
the two ends must now be joined.

179
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,057
this automated machine assembles
the two tubes together

180
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,026
to form the pantyhose.

181
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,868
then scissors
cut the pantyhose,

182
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,004
a necessary step
in production of a pair.

183
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,145
this opening is enlarged
to allow for sewing,

184
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:32,349
which will join the two tubes
at the top of the leg.

185
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,885
the label with the size
or brand name

186
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,688
is sewn in place in 10 seconds
by this robotic machine.

187
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,894
at this pace, it sews on
4,800 labels in 8 hours.

188
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,830
installing a gusset
requires some preparation.

189
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,766
scissors makes a hole
at the joining point.

190
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,970
then the stocking
is turned inside out by suction

191
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,240
so certain stitching
can be done on the inside.

192
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,210
thus, these stitches
will be less visible.

193
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,325
now the foot must be sewn.

194
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,328
this robotic machine
places the foot in position.

195
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,597
then a sewing machine
makes stitches

196
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,601
at the same time it cuts away
excess material.

197
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,938
this step takes only 10 seconds.

198
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,675
then the pantyhose
is turned right side out,

199
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,244
again using suction.

200
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,288
everything is ready
for installation of the gusset.

201
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,492
the pantyhose is placed in a tub
and taken to this department.

202
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,628
the stocking is again suctioned

203
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,364
and placed on a gusset machine
by the operator.

204
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,167
this method assures that
the gusset will be well-centered

205
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,736
without a pleat.

206
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,308
putting in the gusset is the
final operation in the process.

207
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,910
a precut piece of cotton

208
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,980
is slid into the space
reserved for the gusset

209
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,183
and automatically sewn in.

210
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,854
only aesthetic touches remain,

211
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,124
such as adding a little color
to the pantyhose.

212
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,193
they're placed in this machine,

213
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,263
which has a large drum
with four compartments

214
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,265
and a 99-pound capacity.

215
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,001
the pantyhose are washed
in soapy water,

216
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,535
then immersed in dye.

217
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,540
temperature climbs gradually
to 200 degrees fahrenheit.

218
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,143
after a 5-minute rinsing cycle,
a softener is added.

219
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:44,514
this process takes 2 1/2 hours.

220
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,484
once dried,
they proceed to inspection.

221
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,153
the pantyhose
is placed onto a form

222
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,289
which stretches it
to allow inspection

223
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,624
for any imperfections.

224
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,826
if all is well,

225
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,029
the pantyhose is transferred
onto another metal form,

226
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,564
where it will be pressed.

227
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,772
the pantyhose's position
is guided by a magic eye.

228
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,311
the pantyhose is then
carried toward a steam room,

229
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,180
where it will stay
for 2 1/2 seconds

230
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:21,585
before being dried in
7 1/2 seconds at 280 degrees.

231
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,989
they fold and pack
420 pantyhose per hour

232
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:30,060
and make 180,000 pairs per day.

233
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,538
narrator: throughout the ages,
artificial light

234
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,808
has let people extend
the convenience of daylight

235
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,010
long after the sun goes down.

236
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,879
fluorescent tubes
are more energy-efficient

237
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,214
than light bulbs.

238
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:55,085
that's probably why they've
become a "fixture," so to speak,

239
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,355
in stores, factories,
and offices.

240
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,498
once, the only source of light
was the flame of fire

241
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,968
in the forms of torch,
candle, and oil lamps.

242
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,305
it remained so
right up until the 19th century,

243
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,909
when gaslight made its first
appearance around 1840.

244
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,443
almost 40 years later,

245
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,514
thomas edison invented his
famous incandescent light bulb.

246
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,982
in 1909,

247
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,853
the frenchman georges claude
developed the fluorescent tube,

248
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:33,991
a light that remains unaltered
to this very day.

249
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,669
did you know that mercury
allows us to see in the dark?

250
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,673
the production of fluorescent
lamps is highly complex.

251
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,944
the fabrication process
starts with glass tubes

252
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,680
that have been meticulously
cleaned with warm water

253
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,982
to remove dirt and impurities.

254
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,621
then the tubes have to be
specifically shaped

255
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,956
with a folder-shaper.

256
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,291
they're heated for 30 seconds,

257
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,827
then quickly curved
using a template.

258
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:18,668
this automated machine
can bend 14 tubes a minute.

259
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,377
the bent tubes go into
the coating chamber,

260
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
where a thin coat of phosphorus

261
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,949
is applied
to their inner surfaces.

262
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:37,086
phosphorus produces light by
transforming ultraviolet photons

263
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,957
generated by the ionization
of mercury.

264
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,328
the surplus phosphorus
is removed

265
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,731
from the ends of the tube
to facilitate sealing.

266
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,935
they now move
to the electrical components.

267
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:58,074
the cathode mount is made
in this auto mount.

268
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,877
here, they make the wire

269
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,947
that will carry the current
from the mount.

270
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,417
the wire carrying the current
is shaped.

271
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,889
and here, the wire is heated.

272
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,825
this prepares it
for the next step.

273
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,494
it's essential to prevent
the cathode coating

274
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,629
from spreading to the prongs.

275
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:23,700
the filaments are inserted
into their mounts.

276
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,702
the emissive substance plays
a crucial role.

277
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,971
when heated, it emits electrons,

278
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,774
which participate
in producing light.

279
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,777
the emissive substance
is actually this liquid.

280
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,847
the wiring mount is transferred
from the auto mount

281
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,918
to the sealing machine.

282
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,052
at this stage,

283
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,456
the wiring mount
and the glass tube are joined.

284
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,895
sealing is done
at a very high temperature.

285
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,885
one important step remains.

286
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,623
this is where the glass tube
is emptied of air

287
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,824
and filled with gas.

288
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,160
this machine also
decarbonizes the tube

289
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,497
and introduces
the drop of mercury

290
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,433
essential for producing light.

291
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,436
once the very tiny drop
of mercury

292
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,172
is injected into the tube,

293
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,342
the fluorescent lamp
is almost completed.

294
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,790
but one step remains.

295
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,792
this threader positions
the wires

296
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,527
for insertion of the tube cap,

297
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,263
which establishes
electrical contact.

298
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,133
the tube cap is placed
into position

299
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,869
in preparation for sealing.

300
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,138
the cap must be
securely attached

301
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,607
and installed
in a watertight manner

302
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,909
to eliminate
any risk of leaking.

303
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:20,216
the capper permanently seals
the cap onto the tube,

304
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,485
and it's all finished.

305
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,230
each lamp is tested
on a large testing wheel

306
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,300
to verify its quality
and performance.

307
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,042
once the meticulous inspection
is over,

308
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,311
the fluorescent lamps
are carried

309
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,146
to the packaging department.

310
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,389
a robotic machine handles
the lamps

311
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,591
and places them
into the packages.

312
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:06,263
the glass tubes have now
become fluorescent lamps.

313
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,870
if you have any comments
about the show,

314
