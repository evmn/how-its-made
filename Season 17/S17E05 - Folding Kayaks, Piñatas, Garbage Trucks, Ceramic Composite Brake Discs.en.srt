1
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,053
  narrator: the folding kayak   
     is a seaworthy vessel      

2
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:57,056
    that can be disassembled    
and stuffed into a duffel bag.  

3
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,058
  this boat-in-a-bag concept    

4
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,994
    was developed in germany    
        a century ago.          

5
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,330
      it's a good fit for       
      the modern traveler's     
           lifestyle            

6
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,632
    because it can be stowed    
        in a car trunk,         

7
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:10,536
     checked on to a plane,     
     or stashed in the condo    
            closet.             

8
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,274
       history has shown        
  that when going gets rough,   

9
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,809
       the folding kayak        
      doesn't fall apart.       

10
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,078
    adventurers have crossed    
             oceans             
           in them,             

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,016
      and today its story       
     continues to unfold.       

12
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:25,550
        the kayak frame         

13
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,154
   starts with parts cut from   
solid ash and laminated birch.  

14
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,556
      for waterproofing,        

15
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,092
 they dip them in marine-grade  
     varnish three times,       

16
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,361
    drying them for 24 hours    
         between dips.          

17
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,564
      a worker then rivets      
        metal fittings          

18
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,432
     to a varnished section     
      of the keel board.        

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,835
      it's these fittings       
 that enable the folding kayak  

20
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,638
      to move with the sea      
    instead of against it.      

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,974
  that's because they're made   
 of an aluminum-copper alloy,   

22
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,511
          a metal with          
   a certain amount of give.    

23
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:57,383
 he fastens more aluminum-alloy 
  fittings on the cross ribs.   

24
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,518
     there will be a total      
      of seven cross ribs       

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,387
       in this two-seater       
        folding kayak.          

26
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:04,190
        the center three        
 will carry most of the load,   

27
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,526
 so they're made of nine layers 
      of laminated birch.       

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,796
       it's super strong        
  because unlike solid wood,    

29
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,165
        it has few knots        
       or imperfections.        

30
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:16,068
    he applies a label with     
the production's serial number  

31
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,671
  to a boomerang-shaped piece   
         of the frame.          

32
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,539
  this is how the kayak owner   

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,875
   would actually assemble the  
              boat              
           on-site.             

34
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,477
     he locks two sections      
  of the keel board together    

35
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,514
   with the flexible fitting    
   we saw installed earlier.    

36
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:33,885
     he snaps the bow piece     
         to the front           

37
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,423
  and hooks rods into fittings  
     installed on the bow.      

38
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:42,361
  he fastens a couple of ribs   
      to the keel board.        

39
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:46,231
 the gunnels, which are the top 
 sides of the boat, are next.   

40
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,367
he attaches one end to the bow  

41
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,902
         and the other          
      to one of the ribs.       

42
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,838
    the bow and stern parts     
        are color-coded         

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,973
   with red-painted fittings    
          for the bow           

44
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,075
 and blue ones for the stern.   

45
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:02,648
   all the parts fit together   
       like a toy model.        

46
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,184
      with both gunnels now     
           attached,            

47
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,453
     he's ready to install      
         more ribs --           

48
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,289
    the laminated birch ones    
    that form the cockpit.      

49
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,695
          he completes          
     the assembly of rods.      

50
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,732
    all these rods will give    
      the kayak directional     
           stability.           

51
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,935
        he unfolds part         
  of the kayak deck assembly,   

52
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,270
     known as the coaming,      

53
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,473
  and arranges it to surround   
         the cockpit.           

54
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,010
 he attaches it to the gunnels  

55
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:34,613
     using metal clamps and     
           fittings.            

56
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:39,952
    he slides the two seats     
 into place on the keel board.  

57
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:43,055
 and he attaches the back rest  
        to the gunnels.         

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,092
    the frame of this folding   
             kayak              

59
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:52,497
   is now complete and ready    
   for its custom-made skin.    

60
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,633
over in the sewing department,  

61
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,036
     the seamstress traces      
   the patterns for the kayak   
              deck              

62
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:02,308
 onto cotton-hemp material and  
cuts along the penciled lines.  

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,377
 this natural fabric will allow 
      the deck to breathe       

64
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,712
 and yet keep it water-tight.   

65
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:12,651
     it's now time to piece     
            together            
       all of the parts,        

66
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,855
   including two long sleeves   
    for inserting inflatable    
             tubes.             

67
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,592
      deflated, the tubes       
      will create slack,        

68
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,528
    making it easier to fit     
   the frame into the skin.     

69
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,198
 inflated, they make the kayak  
     virtually unsinkable.      

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,934
     once the thick layers      
 have been stitched together,   

71
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,670
     she's ready to insert      
     the inflatable tubes.      

72
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,406
  they were pumped full of air  
   to be examined for holes,    

73
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,676
     so she deflates them.      

74
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,013
      she uses a long pole      
      to extend her reach       

75
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,483
  and push the inflatable tube  
       into the sleeve.         

76
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:48,019
  with a synthetic rubber hull  
    now stitched to the deck    
            fabric,             

77
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,023
 the skin is complete and ready 
 for the kayak's wooden frame.  

78
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,493
     this particular model      
    has been painted black.     

79
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,496
   if the fit is even slightly  
              off,              

80
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,365
    the kayak won't perform     
           properly.            

81
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,668
  the skin fits like a glove.   

82
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,174
 he brushes glue onto the tips  
     of the bow and stern       

83
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,778
 and then presses molded rubber 
   bumpers onto those areas.    

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,914
    the bumpers will protect    
 the ends of the hull casing,   

85
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,316
          which takes           
     a lot of hard knocks.      

86
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,190
       in total, it takes       
     about 50 person-hours      

87
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,991
   to make a folding kayak.     

88
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,661
    it should take the owner    
       about 15 minutes         

89
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,330
   to disassemble or assemble   
              one.              

90
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,333
    for some, it will become    
    a traveling essential,      

91
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,670
   part of the luggage on any   
             trip.              

92
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:56,354
     narrator: the piata is     
 a colorful paper-mache object  

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,091
        typically filled        
   with candy or small toys,    

94
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,960
      then suspended high       
        from a string.          

95
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,496
    blindfolded partiers take   
             turns              

96
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,766
    trying to hit the piata     
 with a stick to break it open  

97
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,035
     and release a shower of    
            goodies.            

98
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:18,577
      from popular cartoon      
           characters           
 to colorful, glittery shapes,  

99
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,313
  today's piatas are a big hit  
       at kid's parties         

100
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,183
  where children eagerly await  
       the decisive blow        

101
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:28,787
  that breaks open the piata,   
 releasing the treats inside.   

102
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,257
  the traditional way to build  
              one               

103
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:36,595
     starts with a clay pot     
   suspended from a string.     

104
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,331
     the piata-maker glues      
    cardboard shapes to it      

105
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,568
   and secures them by gluing   
    on pieces of newspaper.     

106
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,207
        then she covers         
     the rest of the pot.       

107
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,942
     when the glue dries,       

108
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:53,646
   she decorates the surface    
     with colorful paper.       

109
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:03,622
  the modern method is to use   
   a balloon instead of a clay  
              pot.              

110
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,093
 after inflating the balloon,   

111
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,496
 she pastes pieces of newspaper 
         all over it.           

112
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,666
    this technique is known     
        as paper-mache.         

113
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,842
   the trick is to completely   
    saturate the newspaper      

114
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,177
      with a thick paste        

115
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,280
    and make sure no part of    
the balloon is left uncovered.  

116
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,589
  she continues this process    

117
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:40,859
  until she's built up two or   
three even layers of newspaper  

118
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,361
     all over the balloon.      

119
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,833
      then she suspends it      
   from a clothespin to dry.    

120
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,874
 hours later, the paper-mache   

121
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,210
    is hardened into a shell    
      around the balloon,       

122
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:02,247
      which she now breaks      
         and removes.           

123
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,352
   next, she cuts an opening    
   at the top of the shell.     

124
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,954
       this is the hole         

125
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,623
  through which the buyer will  
  fill the piata with treats.   

126
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:17,029
 she'll later reattach the cut  
  piece to make a trap door.    

127
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,165
 but first, with the sharp tips 
       of her scissors,         

128
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,569
   she pierces a row of holes   
    along the circumference     

129
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:26,739
    and threads twine through   
             them.              

130
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,980
   she leaves long ends at the  
              top               

131
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,550
     with which to suspend      
          the piata.            

132
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:47,725
       this piata will be       
          star-shaped.          

133
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,127
      to make each point,       

134
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,965
    she rolls thin cardboard    
into a cone, taping it closed.  

135
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:02,408
          she trims it          
     to the required size,      

136
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,045
   then cuts tabs at the base   
     and bends them back.       

137
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,751
        she makes seven         
  of these cardboard points,    

138
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,487
 then tapes them onto the shell 
          one by one.           

139
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,698
once all seven are positioned,  

140
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,835
 the decorating with colorful,  
 glittery foil wrapping paper   

141
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,537
          can begin.            

142
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,343
    she tapes a sheet around    
    each point of the star.     

143
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,985
     then she applies glue      
     in between the points      

144
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:52,724
 and adheres pieces of wrapping 
     paper to those areas.      

145
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,527
     she folds other pieces     
      into flower shapes        

146
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,797
  and glues them on, as well.   

147
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,140
     once the entire piata      
          is covered,           

148
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,877
  she tapes matching streamers  
   to the end of each point.    

149
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,146
       historians believe       
     spanish missionaries       

150
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,813
used star piatas like this one  

151
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:20,152
 to convert the native peoples  
       in the americas to       
         christianity.          

152
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,687
  the star symbolized satan,    

153
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,290
       its seven points,        
    the seven deadly sins,      

154
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,626
     its beautiful colors,      
          temptation.           

155
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,162
       wearing a blindfold      
           represented          
      blind faith in god.       

156
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,432
       striking the piata       
  with a stick meant goodness   

157
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,233
   and virtue battling evil.    

158
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:39,304
 breaking the piata, releasing  
      a shower of treats or     
           trinkets,            

159
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,373
 symbolized heavenly rewards.   

160
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,858
     narrator: human beings     
have always generated garbage.  

161
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,060
         in the battle          
  to keep the streets clean,    

162
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,929
  the mechanized garbage truck  
     is a combat vehicle.       

163
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,232
   it crushes tons of trash     

164
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,800
     en route to deliver it     
         to landfills,          

165
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,536
         incinerators,          
   and recycling facilities.    

166
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:15,474
    without it, we'd all be     
     knee-deep in garbage.      

167
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,080
 garbage trucks have different  
     approaches to handling     
            garbage.            

168
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:26,551
   some load from the front,    
 other from the rear or side.   

169
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,622
      and some are entirely     
           mechanized           
 like this side-loader truck.   

170
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,626
  the operator inside the cab   
 barely needs to lift a finger  

171
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,895
   as the hydraulic lift-arm    
   does all the heavy work.     

172
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,631
       the garbage truck        
      has come a long way       

173
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,168
    since it hit the street     
           in 1952.             

174
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,103
           production           
 on a modern side-loader truck  

175
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,306
 begins with a welding robot.   

176
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,508
        the robot fuses         
    numerous steel supports     

177
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,243
   to the truck body floor.     

178
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,245
         these supports         
     will allow the truck       

179
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:58,183
   to hold up to the force of   
              tons              
    of trash being compacted    
            inside.             

180
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,053
    meanwhile, down the line,   
              other             
 parts like the roof and sides  

181
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,455
           take shape           
    in separate assemblies.     

182
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,923
    once they're complete,      

183
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,459
   they hoist the large steel   
              parts             
          into place            

184
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,328
       and assemble them        
   within a metal framework.    

185
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,730
    the framework serves as a   
             guide              

186
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,801
       to piece together        
   all the parts of the truck   
              box.              

187
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,404
  once assembled, the workers   
   clamp the parts together     

188
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,808
     to secure the assembly     
    as they weld the seams.     

189
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,144
 the garbage truck body is then 
    ready for the mechanized    
             parts,             

190
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,413
   beginning with a hopper.     

191
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,949
       it's equipped with       
      a powerful, hydraulic     
           compactor            

192
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:34,419
    to squeeze as much trash    
  as possible into the truck.   

193
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,756
   they fit the hopper snugly   
to the front of the truck body  

194
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,626
      and weld it to it.        

195
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,961
  then they lift the tailgate   
         into position          

196
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,697
 at the rear of the truck box.  

197
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,033
  they hinge it to the truck    

198
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,470
   by sliding heavy-duty steel  
              pins              
       through brackets.        

199
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,976
 once hinged, the tailgate can  
  swing up and out of the way   

200
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,045
        to allow garbage        
       to be discharged.        

201
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,714
  the driving force for this    

202
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:06,451
     is a pair of hydraulic     
            cylinders           
     attached by brackets,      

203
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,386
     welded to the tailgate     
          at one end            

204
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,622
    and the truck body at the   
             other.             

205
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,059
      with that job done,       
        these cylinders         

206
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,995
         can now extend         
     to lift the tailgate       

207
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,330
   and retract to close it.     

208
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,266
   across the factory floor,    

209
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,603
     another team assembles     
  a pair of steel lift-arms.    

210
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,606
  these lift-arms are designed  
  for another kind of truck,    

211
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,073
     the front-end loader.      

212
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,676
  it's mainly used to collect   

213
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:34,879
        hefty commercial        
      garbage containers.       

214
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,151
  in action, these arms pivot   
     around the truck cab       

215
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,953
   and extend to the front to   
              fork              
    up the trash container      

216
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,356
    and deposit the contents    
        in the hopper.          

217
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:48,026
      hydraulic cylinders       
  also power these lift-arms.   

218
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,029
   when the task is complete,   
   the forks at the end of the  
              arms              

219
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,031
   fold back out of the way.    

220
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,503
      nearby, workers test      
    this rear-loader garbage    
             truck.             

221
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,306
     its tailgate is split      
      into two hoppers --       

222
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,775
      one for recyclables       
   and the other for trash.     

223
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:09,247
  hydraulic systems lift them   
        one at a time or        
        simultaneously.         

224
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,249
       collecting garbage       
      and disposing of it       

225
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,251
          can be tough          
    on a truck's paint job,     

226
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:17,189
         so they apply          
   an extra-durable finish.     

227
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,325
       they spray sealer        
 on the sanded outer surface,   

228
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,395
     followed by two coats      
        of epoxy paint.         

229
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:26,731
          after that,           
   they bake on the layers.     

230
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,202
  meanwhile, the truck chassis  
               has              
 arrived from another factory.  

231
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,937
     it's a standard size,      

232
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,140
   so they chop a piece off to  
              size              
it for the garbage-truck body.  

233
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:38,210
  they install bracket plates   
          at the back           

234
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,611
      and slide thick pins      
       through the holes        

235
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,714
     to join the truck body     
        to the chassis.         

236
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:49,153
  using a crane, they lift the  
   automated side-loader truck  
              body              

237
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,089
  onto the modified chassis.    

238
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,633
      once it's installed,      
   they test the compactor.     

239
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,101
   dual hydraulic cylinders     

240
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,037
     push the ejector blade     
   to the back of the truck.    

241
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,376
   they test the tailgate --    
which has by now been equipped  

242
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,312
 with signal lights, mud flaps, 
      and other parts --        

243
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:19,851
   and verify that everything   
      functions properly.       

244
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,053
  once a truck passes muster,   

245
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,187
     it's ready to handle       

246
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,591
        whatever garbage        
    society throws its way.     

247
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,798
    and with these automated    
        garbage trucks,         

248
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,601
   there's no need for anyone   
     to strain their back       

249
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,203
   or get their hands dirty,    

250
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:42,174
    because these robot arms    
        can handle it.          

251
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,291
           narrator:            
     high-performance cars      

252
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,627
     typically have ceramic     
            composite           
          brake disks           

253
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,163
          rather than           
    regular cast-iron ones.     

254
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,033
  that kind of power on wheels  
  requires being lightweight,   

255
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,301
 and cast iron is very heavy.   

256
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,169
     it would also wear out     
          too quickly           

257
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,840
    due to the intense heat     
      friction generates        

258
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:18,643
      when you brake a car      
 with such a powerful engine.   

259
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:23,515
   ceramic is heat-resistant    
       up to 1,830 degrees      
          fahrenheit.           

260
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,384
    therefore, these ceramic    
     composite brake disks      

261
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:30,188
   last about 60 times longer   
than standard cast-iron disks.  

262
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,124
    ceramic composite means     
 the ceramic material silicon   

263
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,728
          is combined           
      with carbon fiber for     
           strength.            

264
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,063
        the disk factory        
   prepares the carbon fiber    

265
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,731
 by mixing two ingredients --   

266
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,602
     a heat-molded resin and    
             chopped            
  pieces of raw carbon fiber,   

267
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,738
     the strength of which      
   lies in the interweaving     

268
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,942
        of its miniscule        
       carbon filaments.        

269
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,546
  automated machines pour the   
   carbon fiber into aluminum   
             molds              

270
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,882
in the shape of the disk ring.  

271
00:16:56,884 --> 00:17:00,886
    the first filling station   
              fills             
 the mold cavity only halfway.  

272
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,093
   workers then fit a slotted   
              belt              
        around the mold         

273
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,429
   and insert aluminum cores    
        into the slots.         

274
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,965
     these cores will form      
     a ventilation channel      

275
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,502
    in the disk ring to keep    
  the disk from overheating.    

276
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,650
     now the mold moves on      
 to the next filling station.   

277
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,487
     it fills the remainder     
    of the cavity with carbon   
             fiber.             

278
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,625
   a roller levels the top.     

279
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,731
    then workers close up the   
             mold,              

280
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,401
       and a small press        
     pushes down the cover      

281
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,870
     to lightly compact the     
           contents.            

282
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,005
 the mold enters a large press  

283
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,741
     which applies 20 tons      
          of pressure           

284
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,211
    while heating to almost     
    400 degrees fahrenheit.     

285
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,014
this compacts the carbon fiber  

286
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,351
    and transforms the resin    
             powder             
         into plastic.          

287
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,287
 once the mold has cooled down  
     enough to be handled,      

288
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,823
  workers submerge it in cold   
     water for five to eight    
            minutes.            

289
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,093
    this cools the disk ring    
          completely,           

290
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,762
         enabling them          
    to pull out the cores.      

291
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,499
    a computer-guided laser     
    then examines the mold      

292
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,170
  to make sure every last core  
       has been removed.        

293
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,837
 when they get the all-clear,   

294
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,507
  they open the top and bottom  
     sections of the mold       

295
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,409
  and extract the disk ring.    

296
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,315
    computer-guided machines    
    then smooth out the rough   
             areas              

297
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,317
           and drill            
    tiny ventilation holes.     

298
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,921
     they put the disk ring     
         into an oven           

299
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,924
     which, over the course     
         of two days,           

300
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:50,061
   gradually heats it to just   
              over              
   1,800 degrees fahrenheit.    

301
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,063
 this causes a chemical change  

302
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,933
  which transforms the plastic  
         into carbon.           

303
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,136
 next, they take a crucible --  

304
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,205
     a high-heat resistant      
         container --           

305
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,674
    and position five mounts    
            inside.             

306
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,614
    they place the disk ring    
        on the mounts.          

307
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,816
 then in the middle, a funnel,  

308
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:17,222
 into which they pour a ceramic 
    material, a fine silicon    
            powder.             

309
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,624
  then they load the crucible   
  into an oven for 24 hours.    

310
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,761
   it gradually heats the disk  
              ring              

311
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:26,764
   to more than 3,000 degrees   
     fahrenheit, melting the    
            silicon.            

312
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,899
        then it applies         
      low-level suction,        

313
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,036
 drawing the now-liquid silicon 
      into the disk ring.       

314
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,839
 this creates an exceptionally  
       hard new material        

315
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,109
    called silicon carbide.     

316
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,846
 after a computer-guided drill  
     bores mounting holes,      

317
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,581
         the disk ring          
      goes into a chamber       

318
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,117
       where it receives        
  a coat of protective paint.   

319
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:49,788
  the paint shields the carbon  
in this disk ring from oxygen,  

320
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,459
  which is critical because at  
     high heat, oxygen burns    
            carbon.             

321
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,260
 this anti-oxidation treatment  

322
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,998
 significantly extends the life 
      of the brake disk.        

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,603
 the paint is cured in an oven, 
     leaving behind a white     
            residue.            

324
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,739
     a robot sands it off,      

325
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,975
         then polishes          
 the entire disk-ring surface.  

326
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,816
          here's what           
    the finished disk ring      

327
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,152
 looks like before it's cleaned 
        and polished...         

328
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:26,624
         ...and after.          

329
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,692
 every single brake disk ring   

330
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,228
           undergoes            
   a meticulous inspection.     

331
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,831
   this sophisticated machine   
        takes thousands         

332
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,566
 of high-definition photographs 
        of the surface,         

333
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,704
 which a computer then analyzes 
    in micron-level detail.     

334
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,373
  to complete the brake disk,   
     they affix the bell,       

335
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,909
      a circular component      
         in the middle          

336
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,045
 which connects the brake disk  
        to the vehicle.         

337
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,249
   the bell is made of either   
  aluminum or stainless steel   

338
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,385
  and bolted into the mounting  
    holes in the disk ring.
