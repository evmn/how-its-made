00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,055
narrator: a dive light is essential when scuba diving at night,  

4
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,857
but can also be used for daytime dives       

5
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,193
to explore           
underwater caves and shipwrecks.

6
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,063
the deeper you dive, the more water absorbs     

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,332
certain colors in the light spectrum.     

8
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,934
when you use an artificial light,      

9
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,904
you can see the underwater world
in true color.         

10
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:19,244
the dive light is waterproof to a depth of 295 feet.    

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,081
it's brighter than a car headlight,     

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,817
with six outer l.e.d. lights for floodlighting       

13
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,721
and three inner l.e.d.s for alternate spotlighting.  

14
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,559
the dive light begins as a conceptual drawing.    

15
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,097
the mechanical designer sketches out its basic features

16
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,832
and a few proposed shapes.   

17
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,236
then the company creates foam models.      

18
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,305
scuba divers test these models 

19
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,941
and provide feedback on the comfort of each shape. 

20
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,113
this market research results in the final design -- 

21
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,448
a compact, hand-mounted dive-light    

22
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,717
with a user-friendly operating switch        

23
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,587
and three l.e.d. battery-life indicators.    

24
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,928
the housing's components are  
made of durable plastic pellets,

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,930
reinforced with glass fiber.  

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,935
workers load the pellets into an injection molding machine. 

27
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,805
the machine melts them and shoots the molten plastic 

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,343
into the proper mold for the component they are making. 

29
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,546
the machine then cools the plastic to a solid state  

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,281
and injects the newly formed part.     

31
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,217
this is the reflector.     

32
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,420
it combines the light from the six outer l.e.d.s   

33
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,821
into a single beam.      

34
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,423
it's coated in aluminum    

35
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,094
to increase          
the amount of light it reflects.

36
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,896
a 3-d printer produces prototypes      

37
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,232
for all of the parts before they are manufactured. 

38
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,167
guided by a computer,     

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,637
the printer shoots out plastic to build the part       

40
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,839
in three dimensions from the bottom up.      

41
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,311
once the prototype is approved,

42
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,047
they make a mold for mass production.      

43
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,185
this part is called the light pipe.        

44
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,923
it has oval covers for the three
l.e.d. battery-life indicators 

45
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,759
and a waterproof seal.     

46
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:24,002
once all the housing parts are molded, assembly can begin.

47
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:28,406
they insert the light pipe into
the main body of the housing. 

48
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,475
then they attach a switch,   

49
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,144
which turns the light on and off.          

50
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,546
it also toggles the light   

51
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,982
between spotlight and floodlight modes.     

52
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:45,624
they don't need to pierce the housing to connect the switch. 

53
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,560
the switch slides a magnet over
the outside of the housing.  

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,829
the magnetic field communicates
through the housing      

55
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,031
to sensors inside.       

56
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,136
next they insert and connect the circuit board...      

57
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,375
...then the lithium-ion rechargeable battery.     

58
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,178
they plug its connector into the circuit board.    

59
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,516
this cover holds the internal parts in correct alignment.  

60
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,054
a silicone o ring forms a watertight seal    

61
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,057
between the main body and the light head.      

62
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:23,061
they snap the reflector over the nine l.e.d.s,       

63
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,497
which are attached to a round circuit board.   

64
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,600
the circuit board is metal   

65
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,670
so that it will absorb the heat
the l.e.d. lights generate.  

66
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,606
the screw-on aluminum bezel  

67
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,743
makes contact with the circuit board,    

68
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,212
transferring the heat out of the housing       

69
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,213
and into the water.      

70
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,885
they conduct the first quality-control test in water. 

71
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,620
the dive light is turned on  

72
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,224
to verify that it will run   
for 65 minutes on a full charge.

73
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,961
in the second quality-control test,     

74
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,632
they submerge the dive light in a pressurized tank.     

75
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,835
this simulates the pressure the light would be subjected to

76
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,571
at an underwater depth of about 300 feet.       

77
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,974
that's over twice the diving depth        

78
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,177
of a typical recreational dive.

79
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:21,219
if the light doesn't spring a leak, it passes the test.  

80
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,790
they fully recharge the battery,

81
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,925
which takes two and a half hours.     

82
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,393
at full charge,        

83
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,064
all three indicators light up green.        

84
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,799
as the charge drains,     

85
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:37,869
the indicators change from green to orange to red,  

86
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,670
then to flashing red,     

87
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,540
so scuba divers are never in the dark     

88
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,277
about how much juice is left in their light.    

89
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,493
narrator: interchangeable sandals come with numerous ties    

90
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:05,430
that can be used to customize the look of a pair of heels.  

91
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,366
the mix-and-match possibilities
are endless.          

92
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,835
the wearer can try out many different styles      

93
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,838
on a small budget.       

94
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,310
with interchangeable footwear, 

95
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,814
you can change the look without
actually changing your shoes. 

96
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,718
with a variety         

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,254
of cloth and leather strappings
to choose from,        

98
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,457
a pair of sandals can be made to look different 

99
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,992
each time you wear them.    

100
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,796
to make a pair of interchangeable sandals,  

101
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,599
they start with a piece of hardwood,      

102
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,968
like cherry, walnut, or maple. 

103
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,907
the employee cuts the wood to a workable size.      

104
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,810
then computer-driven routers  

105
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,613
carve the rough shape of the sandals' heels,     

106
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,016
making two heels from a single block.      

107
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,490
the router sculpts a cup for the wearer's heel  

108
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,425
and carves a supportive structure     

109
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,693
for the arch of the foot.   

110
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,099
the router then shaves the sides of the heels     

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,002
and exposes the grain of the wood.     

112
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,775
then a worker takes over,   

113
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,845
cutting away excess wood with a band saw.        

114
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,383
she rounds the back of the heels

115
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,286
and further refines the structure.         

116
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,589
she now has a pair of heels.  

117
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,930
another team member brushes rubber cement onto the soles. 

118
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,899
they are made of both natural and synthetic rubber. 

119
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,739
she applies glue to the heels, too.       

120
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,276
she presses the heels to the rubber soles.      

121
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,048
the glue takes 40 minutes to dry.       

122
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,022
faux leather, backed by cushy padding,    

123
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,224
is used to make the footbed.  

124
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,759
this material is similar    

125
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,695
to what is used to make flip-flops.          

126
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,103
the worker transfers the footbeds     

127
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,572
to a silk-screen work station. 

128
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,709
she lowers a stencil with the company's logo on it. 

129
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,446
she applies acrylic ink    

130
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,916
and squeegees the ink across the stencil       

131
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,919
to transfer the imagine to the faux-leather footbeds. 

132
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,930
another employee threads strong nylon cording  

133
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,632
through the holes in the footbeds        

134
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,867
to create loops for the interchangeable ties. 

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,541
he presses rivets into the footbed        

136
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,042
to hold the loops in place.  

137
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,420
then he attaches the second part of the rivets 

138
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,922
to the protruding shafts.   

139
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,228
using the special press,    

140
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,966
he flattens the rivets to secure them to the footbed. 

141
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,767
the loops are now firmly attached        

142
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,736
and should hold up to frequent tying.       

143
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,012
another worker now glues the  
footbeds to the soles and heels.

144
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,521
next, she glues the rubber heel caps      

145
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,123
to the bottoms of the shoes.  

146
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,727
the caps provide tread and make the shoe more durable.

147
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,466
a worker then sands the sides of the sandals,   

148
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,203
blending all the layers together.    

149
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,407
he buffs the sides against a fine grit abrasive  

150
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,910
to give the surface a nice sheen.         

151
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,350
then he rubs an oil-based sealer
into the wooden heels.     

152
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,619
this protects the wood from moisture         

153
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,822
and also accentuates the grain.

154
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,296
it's time to test the ties.  

155
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,832
she threads the ribbons through the loops.       

156
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,468
they're good to go.      

157
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,310
with many colorful ties to choose from,        

158
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,146
these interchangeable sandals are many shoes in one.     

159
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,995
narrator: racecar simulators       

160
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,598
help train racecar drivers off the track.         

161
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,468
they provide realistic visuals and sensations --   

162
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,471
bumps, jolts, swerves --    

163
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,273
whatever movement you'd feel  

164
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,874
if you were sitting in the driver's seat      

165
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,476
of a real racecar.       

166
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,550
this racecar simulator can be programmed to produce  

167
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,620
a range of racing scenarios and weather conditions.    

168
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,690
it can replicate any car on any track.     

169
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,695
first, a computer-guided laser 

170
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,764
cuts many of the simulator's parts from steel sheets.    

171
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,100
after workers sand the rough areas,     

172
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,903
a machine reads the final shape
with a laser          

173
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,338
to make sure the part meets specifications.     

174
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,179
if a part requires bending, it is done with a press.    

175
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,849
this is one of the side brackets
for the driver's seat.     

176
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,385
the simulator's main structure 

177
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,722
is made primarily of steel tubing.        

178
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,325
they saw the lengths required. 

179
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,728
then a computer-guided mill drills holes          

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,263
for the bolts that will later be used    

181
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:16,201
to attach the simulator's components.  

182
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,470
once all the steel tubes are ready,           

183
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,271
a welder puts them in a jig  

184
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,340
to align them correctly for assembly.         

185
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:38,156
the structure's tubular parts are welded together.      

186
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,426
then the worker adds the simulator's sheet-steel parts 

187
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:46,030
and sprays the structure with industrial-grade paint.  

188
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,367
now they mount an audio speaker and amplifier 

189
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,102
for the vibration system.   

190
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,371
motion controllers that move  

191
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,972
the steering wheel and driver's seat        

192
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,641
are also added.        

193
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,046
they install the power distribution block  

194
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:07,585
and a sub-controller for each of the two actuators. 

195
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,389
they install the cables required
for the simulator's components 

196
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,524
and plug them into a usb hub. 

197
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,793
then they install the computer 

198
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:21,065
and plug it into the usb hub, as well.            

199
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,468
they cover the top of the structure        

200
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,071
with a textured aluminum panel.

201
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,208
they bolt the bottom of the actuators to the structure 

202
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,078
and plug them         
into the sub-controllers inside.

203
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,481
then they mount the driver's seat       

204
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,752
and bolt the top of the actuators to the back of it.  

205
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,156
a worker installs the seat belt,

206
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,026
along with the spring mechanism
that yanks the belt back    

207
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,630
when you hit the brakes.    

208
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,966
they close in the sides of the main structure     

209
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,267
with aluminum panels.     

210
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,372
next they assemble the simulator's three pedals --

211
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,641
gas, brakes, and clutch --   

212
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,944
and mount the clutch mechanism to it.  

213
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,451
the pedal assembly is installed

214
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,355
to the base of the steering frame.     

215
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,327
they mount the dashboard to the top of the frame.    

216
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,995
it's made of carbon fiber   

217
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,931
and contains the computer and audio controls.      

218
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,804
they attach the steering frame to the main structure.     

219
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,011
then they assemble the steering wheel.      

220
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,214
inside its base is a circuit board       

221
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,817
that controls the buttons on the wheel and gear shift.  

222
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,786
it's called the shift paddle. 

223
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,859
they mount the shift paddle to the base...         

224
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,664
...then flip it over to attach the wheel.      

225
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,044
next workers assemble the display frame.       

226
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,646
it holds the simulator's three monitors         

227
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,715
and three front speakers.   

228
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,184
then they roll in the rest of the simulator   

229
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,054
and plug the monitors and speakers into the computer.

230
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,395
finally, the steering wheel is mounted to the dash.    

231
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,931
it snaps in and out, allowing the driver       

232
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:37,402
to easily switch between steering wheel models. 

233
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,471
the simulator is run through several days of test drives   

234
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,706
before it ships out.      

235
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,544
amusement parks also purchase these simulators 

236
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,214
to offer visitors a racecar driving experience. 

237
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,818
they can even link multiple simulators together  

238
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,820
to race against each other in virtual replicas      

239
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,890
of the world's most famous racetracks.    

240
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,967
narrator: in the 1980s,    

241
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,236
fiberglass doors came on the market.      

242
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,371
they were well-insulated    

243
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,306
and didn't warp in humid conditions      

244
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,041
like wood doors.        

245
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,511
however, they lacked the beauty
and texture of real wood.   

246
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,579
that's now changing with technology        

247
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,616
that can make fiberglass doors look much more inviting.    

248
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,724
fiberglass doors trick the eye and fool visitors.   

249
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,394
even up close, they look like real wood.   

250
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:41,666
it's an illusion made possible with the help of technology.  

251
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:46,470
a wood-grain fiberglass door starts with a real wood door. 

252
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,740
a computerized cutter carves various panels.     

253
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:55,346
an employee sands away any marks left by the cutter. 

254
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,014
he gently scrapes the wood   

255
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,217
with a wire brush to expose the grain.      

256
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,756
he then assembles the panels  

257
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,724
of the door within a special fixture.       

258
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,696
another team member scans the wood door with a laser   

259
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,033
to confirm its dimensional accuracy.   

260
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,768
with that confirmation,    

261
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,637
they're ready to use this wood door         

262
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,172
to make a fiberglass one.   

263
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,044
next the worker pours a special
silicone mixture onto the wood 

264
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,446
and leaves it to cure overnight.

265
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:34,185
this step was demonstrated using
a smaller section of the door. 

266
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:37,388
the silicone picks up all the definition of the wood grain, 

267
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,592
creating an exact copy of the door.   

268
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,595
next an employee injects a different silicone mixture  

269
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,863
into a thin gap        

270
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,932
between the recently created silicone copy         

271
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,534
and a sheet of steel.     

272
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,004
the second silicone door copy is thinner,          

273
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:57,675
allowing for a better transfer 
of heat during the next process.

274
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,878
they load the door copy, still on the steel sheet,   

275
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,548
into a chemical deposition chamber.            

276
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,483
the chemical heats the steel and the silicone,  

277
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,751
causing a nickel-vapor shell to form.            

278
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,820
the nickel shell has all the detail       

279
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,288
of the original wood door.   

280
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,158
an employee files the edges  

281
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,693
and adds a protective fiberglass cover 

282
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,430
over the top of the shell.   

283
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,101
workers then lower the nickel shell into a mold base. 

284
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,369
they remove the protective cover

285
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,572
and are ready to use the nickel shell        

286
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,239
to mold fiberglass door veneers.

287
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,707
there are many nickel molds  

288
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,311
and a variety of door styles at this factory.        

289
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,387
the fiberglass material now unwinds into a cutting station.

290
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,691
a worker slices it into uniform strips.      

291
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,597
the fiberglass has a dough-like
consistency at this stage.   

292
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,868
he places a stack of fiberglass
strips on the nickel door mold 

293
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,804
and lowers a hot press.    

294
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,476
the press squeezes and melts the fiberglass.        

295
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,546
it flows into the crevices of the mold.          

296
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,348
the fiberglass solidifies quickly.      

297
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,217
an employee removes it from the press         

298
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,954
and sands the ragged edges.  

299
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,489
another member of the team   

300
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,691
confirms that the width and thickness of the panel   

301
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,059
are on target.         

302
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,964
they stain every first-run fiberglass panel   

303
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,300
to expose the transferred wood grain.  

304
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,968
this is a test.        

305
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,369
if the grain is good,     

306
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,573
it means there are no defects in the nickel door mold.    

307
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,043
it's time to assemble the fiberglass door.      

308
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,979
rollers apply glue to external framing wood.   

309
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,586
the team builds a frame around the fiberglass door skin.   

310
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,988
they join the wood to plastic casing        

311
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,325
at the top and bottom of the door.          

312
00:19:54,327 --> 00:20:00,530
they place a second      
fiberglass door skin on the top.

313
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,000
then they feed the door through rollers    

314
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,735
that squeeze it together.   

315
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,605
this activates the glue for a strong assembly.     

316
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,843
the glue takes over 24 hours to dry.     

317
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,948
next they load the hollow fiberglass doors  

318
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,217
into an insulating press.   

319
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,424
the press closes, holding the doors tightly in place.  

320
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,425
a worker fills the hollow doors

321
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,695
with polyurethane insulating foam.        

322
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,301
when foam begins to overflow through the vent holes,    

323
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,570
the worker knows the doors are full.      

324
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,942
he caps the fill hole...    

325
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,916
...and runs a finger along the 
doors to remove any excess foam.

326
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,520
energy-efficient and stable,  

327
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:00,257
fiberglass doors        
are a great alternative to wood.

328
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,962
with eye-catching wood grain, they're convincing imitations. 

329
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,673
