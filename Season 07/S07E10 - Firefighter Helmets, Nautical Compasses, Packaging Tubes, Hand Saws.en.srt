narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,394
firefighter helmets.      

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,999
nautical compasses.      

6
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,571
packaging tubes.        

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,444
and handsaws.         

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,920
in the early 1800s,      

9
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,721
luggage maker henry gratacap  

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,924
created one of the first firefighter hats. 

11
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,059
the leather helmet had a long rear brim      

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,263
and curved sides as a shield against falling debris     

13
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,131
and water running down the neck.

14
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,267
except for a few high-tech additions,      

15
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,236
this basic design is still used today.      

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,547
leather is surprisingly flame-resistant.        

17
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,881
when reinforced,        

18
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,417
it also becomes a remarkable hard hat,     

19
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,888
protecting from heat, liquids, and sudden impact.       

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,223
on this newer model,      

21
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,259
the accessories shield the eyes and ears, too. 

22
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:42,968
a helmet starts with four die-cut leather sections.   

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,369
they sew them together     

24
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,239
to make what's called the skull of the helmet.    

25
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,911
this piece will become the brim of the helmet.    

26
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,779
to give the skull structure,  

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,048
a worker folds and sews each section,     

28
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,085
then flattens the crease with a special hammer.     

29
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,789
he uses a template to score a sewing line in the leather. 

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,858
then he uses a powerful sewing machine   

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,328
to join the sections together. 

32
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,133
he now joins the two halves together,    

33
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,935
reinforcing them with double stitching.     

34
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,403
the resulting eight ridges   

35
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,706
give the skull stiffness and strength.         

36
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,743
he stretches the leather over a plastic mold      

37
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,446
and trims excess leather from the ridges.        

38
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,952
then he clamps four vise grips to the rim.          

39
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,021
these attach to a hydraulic jack

40
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,124
that stretches the skull overnight.      

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,430
after applying glue to the ridges,         

42
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:49,401
he runs them through compression
rollers for a tight bond.   

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,041
they wet the brim piece several times         

44
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,976
to make it more pliable.    

45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,510
then they stamp it       

46
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,782
with the design used by this company since 1846.  

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,420
but first, a worker inserts a wire    

48
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:12,591
that will give the brim some structural support,    

49
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,793
then a temporary plastic cover 

50
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,262
and a lid to ensure an even spread of pressure   

51
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,930
across the brim.        

52
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,333
she stuffs the edges of the leather inside     

53
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:25,537
before the press applies 10 tons
of force to imprint the design. 

54
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,179
next, a worker sews the skull to the brim.          

55
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:43,088
he removes the excess leather at the base of the skull...  

56
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,493
...and cuts out the center of the brim.    

57
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,935
then he removes the plastic mold.       

58
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,707
to seal the leather,      

59
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,976
they dip the hats in a vat of hot rosin,         

60
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,944
a type of tree sap.      

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,581
after 55 minutes,       

62
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,316
they remove them and let them dry        

63
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,851
at room temperature for eight weeks.        

64
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,320
this slow-drying process    

65
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,456
makes the leather about as hard as wood.     

66
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,725
drying it mechanically would make it brittle.     

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,394
now for the inside.      

68
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:26,397
they insert a plastic cap to reinforce the structure.  

69
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,267
the fit is intentionally tight,

70
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,403
so they use a mallet to tap it into place.     

71
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,742
inside that they add another plastic cap  

72
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,980
with nylon straps to resist the impact of falling objects. 

73
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,086
here a worker uses an acetylene torch       

74
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,688
to burn off any loose threads and soften the leather     

75
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,956
in order to bend the brim   

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,959
and straighten the ridges later on.      

77
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,909
turning up the sides is basically for aesthetics,  

78
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,445
but the longer edge in the back

79
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,981
is to direct water away from the neck.      

80
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,652
after adding a synthetic, fire-retardant liner,     

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,856
he sands the outer surface to prep it for painting.    

82
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,925
first, a fire-retardant chemical primer.        

83
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,262
then they use a semigloss latex paint    

84
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,198
in firefighter's black or white
for the chief...        

85
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,469
...or, if you prefer, a clear varnish        

86
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,738
to show off the natural leather.

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,072
add a front piece       

88
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,208
with the firefighters' signature brass eagle on top  

89
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,612
and some fluorescent stickers for extra visibility,     

90
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,214
and you've got the right headgear       

91
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,216
for a hero's job.       

92
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,426
narrator: for more than 1,700 years,   

93
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,629
the compass has been helping people find their way.     

94
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,564
it was first developed in china,

95
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,234
but when the far east met the far west,       

96
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,236
european sailors adopted the technology,    

97
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,774
using it to chart their own courses.       

98
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,587
to make a nautical compass, they use this device      

99
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,257
to magnetize a special metal alloy.     

100
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,460
a technician slips a retainer ring onto a jig   

101
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,530
and positions the magnet on top of it.         

102
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:43,468
she places an aluminum skirt over the magnet.        

103
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,939
this will support the compass dial, which goes on next.   

104
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,342
she inserts a pivot needle in the center,         

105
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,077
which will allow the dial to rotate.           

106
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,148
then she press-fits all the pieces together.    

107
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,990
she carefully inspects the fit,
and it looks solid.      

108
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,763
she sprays a chemical cleaner into the pivot cavity.     

109
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,598
it has to be spotless     

110
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,702
because any dirt would impede its function.   

111
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,370
she also cleans a little jewel post      

112
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,440
that contains a tiny sapphire. 

113
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,111
then she fixes the jewel post in the dial.          

114
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,580
the jewel post will support the dial     

115
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,182
while allowing the pivot needle
to move easily         

116
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,685
as it's pulled by magnetic forces.      

117
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,658
she places the dial on a machine
that mimics the earth's pull. 

118
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,694
it's a crucial step because magnetic force varies 

119
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,964
depending on where you are in the world.         

120
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,802
she brushes a weighted paint onto the back of the dial   

121
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,539
to counteract the pull.    

122
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,274
this balances the compass dial,

123
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,877
preventing false readings due to differences       

124
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,946
in the planet's magnetic force.

125
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,088
these are lubber lines -- little direction markers.   

126
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,858
she inserts them into holes in a jig.      

127
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,227
then she lines them up with holes           

128
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,163
in an aluminum gimbal pan   

129
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,032
and press-fits the lubber lines
to the pan.          

130
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,040
now she inserts two pins into the gimbal ring      

131
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,177
that allow the ring to flip around the gimbal pan. 

132
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:38,149
then she attaches the compass dial to the gimbal assembly.  

133
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,728
the technician spray-paints the metal compass bowl black  

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,264
and pops a rubber diaphragm into it.            

135
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,902
a bronze ring will hold it in place.     

136
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,673
this flexible rubber liner will contain the compass fluid 

137
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,545
and allow it to expand and contract.         

138
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,915
she snaps the dial and gimbal setup to the bowl. 

139
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,086
she just has to bend a little tab to level it out. 

140
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,259
she positions an acrylic dome on top.    

141
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,363
using another jig,       

142
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,033
she puts a rubber o-ring over the dome to seal it,   

143
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,902
followed by a metal collar.  

144
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,306
with a power screwdriver,   

145
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,910
she anchors these pieces to the rest of the compass.  

146
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,782
then she pumps fluid into the bowl,         

147
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,185
filling it right up to the dome.          

148
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,658
the fluid makes the numbers on the dial look bigger.    

149
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,998
next, they magnetically charge two metal rods         

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,934
and install them in a compass base.       

151
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,939
they'll compensate       
for magnetic fields on the boat.

152
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,950
she mounts a big metal housing unit on the base.   

153
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,886
then she attaches shock absorbers        

154
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,090
to cushion the compass against engine vibrations.   

155
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,894
she installs the compass in the housing         

156
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,964
and taps the dome to test the shocks.      

157
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,034
a decorative aluminum cover fits around the dome.     

158
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,437
then she installs a light   

159
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,340
to allow the navigator to see at night.        

160
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,245
she attaches iron spheres,   

161
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,183
another tactic to counter magnetic interference.     

162
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,452
our journey through the plan is now over,          

163
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,288
and the compass is ready to be used.      

164
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,530
narrator: artists first used flexible metal containers   

165
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,200
for their paints back in 1841. 

166
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,203
nowadays, we use them for a range of things,     

167
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,206
like toothpaste, glue, and skin cream.        

168
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,676
the tube's design lets us squeeze out most of the product

169
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,012
and yet still read that important fine print   

170
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,048
on the twisted package.    

171
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,754
these packaging tubes are made of aluminum      

172
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,224
because it's affordable, lightweight, and malleable.  

173
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,759
this company makes each tube  

174
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,897
from an aluminum slug about the size of a coin.   

175
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,432
a worker dumps a batch of slugs
in a container,        

176
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,602
then adds a lubricating powder called zinc stearate.     

177
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,177
the container spins,      

178
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,512
causing the powder to coat the slugs evenly    

179
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,182
and prep the metal for stretching later on.    

180
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,385
the slugs then spin around in another container,     

181
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,186
which orients them horizontally

182
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,056
so they'll fit through a channel
at the bottom.         

183
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:10,395
the channel feeds the slugs into a forming press.     

184
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,930
in a process called impact extrusion,    

185
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,933
each slug moves onto a die,  

186
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,134
which gives it the exterior shape of a tube,        

187
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,070
including the neck.      

188
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,808
at the same time, a mandrel forms the interior. 

189
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,743
this process hardens the metal,

190
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,081
something they'll correct later on by heating it.    

191
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,484
the machine applies 200 tons of pressure          

192
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:36,086
to as many as 150 slugs per minute.          

193
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,823
they can be as narrow as a half-inch         

194
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,692
and as long as 8 1/2 inches.  

195
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,773
this machine uses compressed air

196
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,276
to align the tubes for the next step.       

197
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,048
a trimming machine cuts threads into the necks  

198
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,886
by passing each one between two synchronized rollers.   

199
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,926
stationary blades trim the top of the neck,   

200
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,461
making the surface smooth and safe to handle.      

201
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,465
the neck on most models remains sealed         

202
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,467
until the consumer pierces it. 

203
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,736
another company eventually seals the tube   

204
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,170
by rolling up the other end  

205
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,840
after they've inserted their product.         

206
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,545
after heating them to soften the metal,      

207
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,282
the tubes move through another machine.        

208
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:43,621
here nozzles spray the inside 
with two coats of epoxy lacquer.

209
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,823
this creates a protective barrier      

210
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,993
between the aluminum and the eventual contents.   

211
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,037
rollers apply a coat of polyester enamel paint,   

212
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,438
which is flexible when dry   

213
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,775
and resistant to most solvents and sun damage.        

214
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,048
grippers place the tubes on long pins,         

215
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,450
which move them through an oven
for seven minutes       

216
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,052
so the paint can dry.     

217
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,657
from there, it's off to the printing machine.    

218
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,793
each tube makes one complete rotation       

219
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,560
against a printing plate.   

220
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,330
the plate applies a colored image        

221
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,200
and information that describes the tube's contents.      

222
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,336
then they go back in the oven to dry the ink.        

223
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,339
the printing's legible even when twisted       

224
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,876
because the polyester ink remains flexible.       

225
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,419
another machine applies 2.2 pounds of torque  

226
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,488
to screw on the plastic caps. 

227
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,490
most of the caps have pointy tops,       

228
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,093
used to pierce the sealed neck of the tube.          

229
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,160
they use flat caps       

230
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,063
to close off tubes with open necks.        

231
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,834
on the next machine,      

232
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,236
nozzles spray on a strip of latex sealant        

233
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,105
inside the open end of the tube.

234
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,440
the latex is like a gasket.  

235
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,975
after the product is inserted, 

236
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:15,113
it seals the tube when they fold the end over.  

237
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,448
after a machine packs boxes  

238
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,784
with an average of 300 tubes each,       

239
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,987
a worker inspects the inside of every tube.         

240
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,390
a bright spotlight reveals any chip in the paint 

241
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,124
that makes the packaging deficient.    

242
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,495
about one in every 500 tubes is flawed.           

243
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,401
a sheet of sticky paper over the open ends of the tubes

244
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,736
keeps them from twisting during shipping,        

245
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,806
and a label on the box provides tracking information 

246
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,209
and a way to show if someone has tampered with it en route. 

247
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,550
empty, each tube sells for about 12 cents each,    

248
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:56,020
a great bargain for such a useful item.    

249
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,436
narrator: even though it was  
invented thousands of years ago,

250
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,571
the handsaw is still used today.

251
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,507
you'll find it at every building site,    

252
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,708
always at the ready.      

253
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,310
power tools are higher-tech,  

254
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,779
but the handsaw has a basic appeal.      

255
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,447
it doesn't need an extension cord       

256
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,249
and almost never breaks down. 

257
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,919
it's a time-tested building tool.         

258
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,662
handsaws come in many sizes.  

259
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,465
to make them, a machine uncoils steel    

260
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:44,736
and draws it into a mechanized punch.    

261
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,271
the punch works at a blurring speed      

262
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:51,275
to cut teeth in the steel -- 140 notches per minute.    

263
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,878
here it is in slow motion.   

264
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,914
it makes two cuts for each sawtooth.       

265
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,157
a reel takes up the newly serrated steel    

266
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,161
and then will feed it back to cut teeth on the other side.

267
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,099
next, a fingerlike device unrolls the steel       

268
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,168
and pushes it to automated jaws.

269
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,702
the jaws bend the teeth,    

270
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,639
alternating the direction of each one.          

271
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,042
here's a slow-motion look.   

272
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,515
this is called setting the teeth,       

273
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,786
and it will allow the handsaw to operate smoothly.      

274
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,057
now a die punch cuts the steel coil      

275
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,125
into pieces called double blanks --    

276
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:45,329
double because two saw blades will be made from them.    

277
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,266
the die also makes holes in one end of the double blank 

278
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,469
for attaching handles.     

279
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,539
they feed the double blanks to a sheer machine.      

280
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,073
a long blade descends     

281
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,075
and cuts it in half on the diagonal,        

282
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,278
making two saw blades.     

283
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,690
finally, they press the saw blades up against a sand belt 

284
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,424
to smooth out the edges.    

285
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,962
this is called deburring.   

286
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,765
here they're making a higher-end saw blade.    

287
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,766
they flush a piece of steel with coolant          

288
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,636
as a machine plunge-grinds it to make teeth.         

289
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,638
this method is more time-consuming     

290
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,374
but results in a superior tool.

291
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,913
again, they set the teeth,   

292
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:40,184
but this time, mechanical jaws do the job a blade at a time,  

293
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,387
rather than working on one long coil of steel.   

294
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,194
the sawteeth will need to be strengthened       

295
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,796
in order to perform,      

296
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,600
so rollers move the blades to an electrical coil.     

297
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,137
within milliseconds, the temperature of the blade  

298
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,072
shoots up to 1,600 degrees fahrenheit.  

299
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,108
this tempers the steel.    

300
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:14,218
the blades drop off the conveyer into a bin.    

301
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,562
here's a look at a blade before heat-treating.     

302
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,697
and this is after.       

303
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:31,502
the black burn line is a sign this saw can take the pressure.

304
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,639
a conveyer wheel dunks them in a pool of clear protectant. 

305
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,041
this will keep them looking shiny.         

306
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,979
when they're dry,       

307
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,514
the blades undergo a trademark technique.     

308
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,983
they place one on a table.   

309
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,253
it rises and a squeegee silk-screens the company name 

310
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,755
onto it.            

311
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,530
at this point, the ink is still wet.     

312
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,134
they spend 30 seconds in an infrared oven --     

313
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,870
enough time to bake on the brand name.   

314
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,015
they slide cardboard sleeves over the blades,        

315
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,751
and now it's time to attach the handle.     

316
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,554
a worker fits two plastic parts together     

317
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,890
and places them on a carousel. 

318
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,164
an ultrasonic sealer moves in. 

319
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,433
it emits a high-frequency sound,

320
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,568
and the vibrations melt    
the two plastic pieces together,

321
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,338
forming a handle.       

322
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,176
a worker fits the handle onto a blade,         

323
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,678
and a machine rivets it in place.           

324
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,249
some saws have wooden handles. 

325
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,251
because riveting could split the wood,     

326
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,388
they bolt it on with screws and rivnuts.    

327
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,295
and now you have the finished product.     

328
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,672
