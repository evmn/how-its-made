captions paid for by discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,319
narrator: tapioca pudding is a textural fusion      

4
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,455
of creaminess and chewy tapioca pearls.   

5
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,591
the recipe is at least a century old,   

6
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,593
and there are conflicting theories      

7
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,861
about when and where it was invented --       

8
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,864
britain or the united states. 

9
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,699
with its distinctive chewiness,

10
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,869
it brings something entirely different to the table.    

11
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,208
today factories whip up tapioca pudding in big batches.

12
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,743
times have changed,      

13
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,013
but the appetite for this pearly pudding hasn't waned.  

14
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,682
the proof is truly in the pudding.    

15
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,418
the tapioca pearls, of course, define this dish.       

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,020
the opaque, little balls    

17
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:31,223
are processed from a vegetable grown in south america     

18
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,692
called cassava root.      

19
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:36,361
the recipe also calls for more traditional baking ingredients 

20
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,632
like whole milk, eggs...    

21
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,833
sugar...            

22
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,702
and vanilla.          

23
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,705
they pipe the whole milk into a giant mixing kettle.  

24
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,574
this kettle has steam-heated steel walls  

25
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,578
to gently cook the ingredients while blending them.      

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,648
as the milk froths, the cook measures the tapioca pearls.  

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,719
the pearls arrive at the factory already processed, 

28
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:02,788
formed by grinding the root vegetable into powder 

29
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,124
and tumbling it to shape it into properly sized pearls.  

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,060
as the pearls cook in the milk,

31
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,929
they will soften and swell to double the size,      

32
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,998
just like rice.        

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,399
but unlike rice,        

34
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,802
they'll take on an almost jellylike, chewy consistency. 

35
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,938
he adds sugar to sweeten the mix.      

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,874
the cook then leaves the swirling and foaming mix  

37
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:25,210
to cook for over an hour.   

38
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,012
meanwhile, at another station, 

39
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,750
they add tapioca starch to a different blender full of milk.

40
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,485
this blender is unheated    

41
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:36,288
and has higher speed for mixing
that's fast and furious.    

42
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,091
he adds eggs...        

43
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,427
and he flavors the mix with salt.           

44
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,695
the tapioca starch       

45
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:45,497
acts as a thickening agent for this separate mix,     

46
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,034
as the blender whips it to a frothy state.       

47
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,503
they transfer the starch blend to the main mixing kettle.   

48
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,639
the cook adds a natural food coloring  

49
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,610
to make the pudding beige along
with some vanilla flavoring.  

50
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,848
the tapioca pearls are just the right consistency.

51
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,117
this pudding is now fully cooked

52
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,054
and ready to move on to the filling line.      

53
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,124
they pump it while it's still steaming hot 

54
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,593
into single-serve plastic cups.

55
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,762
packaging the pudding while it's still hot      

56
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,664
is an act of food preservation,

57
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,267
which, not surprisingly, is called hot fill.      

58
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,936
the hot-fill technique locks in nutrients       

59
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,805
and ensures freshness,     

60
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,341
giving the product a shelf life
of about 70 days.       

61
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,412
suctioning arms swiftly transfer
foil lids to cover the cups,  

62
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,081
giving the pudding no time to cool down.     

63
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,551
with the lids in place,    

64
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,953
the filler moves the cups forward     

65
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,821
to meet up with heat-sealer heads.    

66
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,291
they fuse the foil lids to the plastic cup rims.    

67
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,893
it's taken just seconds    

68
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,696
to fill these cups with hot tapioca pudding    

69
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,965
and seal them, effectively preserving them.  

70
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,700
the pudding-filled cups    

71
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,570
now funnel into a lane to position them single file. 

72
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,640
then they travel between rubber belts that squeeze them.

73
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,042
if they can take the pressure, 

74
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,644
it confirms that the cups are tightly sealed.      

75
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,581
a printer sprays the expiration date   

76
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,117
and other pertinent information
onto the cup.         

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,521
after weighing to confirm there's enough pudding inside, 

78
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,457
an x-ray machine scans the contents       

79
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,393
to confirm that there are no contaminants.

80
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,597
then they're on the way to the chilling line.     

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,832
inside the tubs,        

82
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,369
the tapioca pudding is still hot and fluid.    

83
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,470
the cups ride a system     

84
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,471
of spiraling, refrigerated conveyors     

85
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,541
bringing the pudding's temperature down 

86
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,610
to about 100-degrees fahrenheit     

87
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,312
and thickening it substantially.

88
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,284
the pudding-filled containers now pass through gates     

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,154
that separate them into two lanes         

90
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:50,623
and then arrange them in groups of three.      

91
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,093
machinery places        
one group of three onto another,

92
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,228
and then all that's left is the packaging.       

93
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,495
mechanical arms        

94
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,432
place the paperboard sleeve on the top three cups.     

95
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,501
traveling through a narrow lane,

96
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,305
guides fold the paperboard down
around the bottom three cups  

97
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,708
as a sprayer applies hot glue to the flaps. 

98
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,044
a worker pulls off one pack of six   

99
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,780
and sends it over to a panel of testers     

100
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,582
for an inspection and taste.  

101
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:20,051
they examine the pudding for color and consistency.   

102
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,521
they also taste a little from each production batch   

103
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,589
to confirm that it's sweet enough,    

104
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,992
that the tapioca beads are the desired texture,    

105
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,928
and that it meets all other quality requirements.

106
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,530
if they like what they taste, 

107
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:35,133
the entire batch is declared ready for retail. 

108
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,870
three hours in the making, this tapioca pudding      

109
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:41,707
is now ready to add a little sweetness to someone's day.   

110
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,354
narrator: a snowplow      

111
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,691
is actually the big blade on a snow-clearing vehicle -- 

112
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,626
not the vehicle itself.    

113
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,494
the first snowplows      

114
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,163
were wedge-shaped wooden blades
drawn by horses.        

115
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,567
as cars replaced horses, these gave way to metal plows 

116
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:12,671
mounted to the front of trucks and other large machines.   

117
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,176
a snowplow is a blade made of either stainless steel,

118
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,578
which is rust-proof,      

119
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,246
or carbon steel,        

120
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,150
which they coat in plastic-based
powder paint to prevent rust. 

121
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,120
to begin making the blade,   

122
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:31,256
they take a sheet of metal about 1/10 of an inch thick  

123
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,791
and insert it in a press.   

124
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,995
the press punches out holes for the bolts,         

125
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,064
which attach the blade to the mounting structure.   

126
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,741
next, they feed the sheet through a rolling press.    

127
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,876
the rollers          
apply 35 to 40 tons of pressure,

128
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,981
curving the sheet to the required shape.     

129
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,893
workers check         

130
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,028
that the front radius and top radius of the curve  

131
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,331
meet the technical specifications.        

132
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,906
next, using a machine called a press break,     

133
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,409
they bend over the top of the sheet.     

134
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:37,356
this bend will sit on the top bar of the mounting structure. 

135
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,863
the mounting structure is made of several parts    

136
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,533
cut from giant plates of carbon steel.        

137
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,539
a computer guides the cutting machine,  

138
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,209
which uses electrogenerated flames.    

139
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,478
their intense, focused heat  

140
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,681
slices through the steel literally by melting it.    

141
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:13,091
the steel is too hot to handle 
when the plasma cutting is done,

142
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,128
so workers lift off the parts with magnets.         

143
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,366
then they bend key, load-bearing parts       

144
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,104
in a press break to increase the structural strength.    

145
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,907
they position the parts    
for one section of the structure

146
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,378
in an assembly fixture and weld them together.    

147
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,452
in a different assembly fixture,
they position the parts    

148
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,788
for another section of the structure.       

149
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,491
a robot welds those together. 

150
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,796
back at the first assembly, they use pins         

151
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,466
to attach a spring-loaded component called a trip edge. 

152
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,268
it protects the vehicle from damage          

153
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,604
by absorbing the shock through the springs,      

154
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,806
rather than through the vehicle frame,   

155
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,941
should the plow hit an obstacle on the road.  

156
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,211
after welding the two sections together,   

157
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,348
workers send the structure to the powder-coating area.  

158
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,150
there, workers spray it first with powder primer       

159
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,819
then with powder paint.    

160
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,022
each coat is baked to activate the plastic base, 

161
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:21,159
which produces an ultra-durable
shell over the metal.     

162
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,694
once the structure cools,   

163
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,764
workers install the springs for the trip edge,       

164
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,365
then they attach the base of the structure   

165
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,700
called the cutting edge.    

166
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,769
it's made of a harder type of steel     

167
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,105
because it scrapes the ground. 

168
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:37,442
the structure is now finished and ready to receive the blade.

169
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,779
this one's getting a stainless-steel blade.    

170
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,849
the bent top fits over the structure's top bar,    

171
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,452
the bottom into a slot below. 

172
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:49,521
workers secure the blade with bolts           

173
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,591
then finish off the plow with a decal.         

174
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,793
for this model,        
they make two plows like this --

175
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,530
mirror images of each other.  

176
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,333
they go side-by-side, connected
in the middle by a hinge    

177
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,102
to form a v-shaped snowplow.  

178
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,138
straight plows have a single blade      

179
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,940
attached to a different type of structure.         

180
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,944
all the parts, except stainless-steel blades, 

181
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,912
are powder-painted and baked. 

182
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,819
the v-plow articulates.    

183
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:26,091
the driver can adjust the width
of the "v" to direct the snow. 

184
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,161
another model combines a straight blade   

185
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:32,564
with hinged blades for clearing snow in large areas, 

186
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,300
such as parking lots.     

187
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,903
when it comes to these types of machines,          

188
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:41,940
there's clearly no business like snow business.      

189
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,524
narrator: a paddle boat is a small recreational vessel,

190
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,860
perfect for a leisurely ride on a lake.           

191
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,396
it gets its name from the rotating paddle wheel 

192
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,530
that propels it.        

193
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,132
you simply sit in the seat   

194
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,668
and turn the paddle wheel by pedaling,          

195
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,202
which is why this type of boat 

196
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,740
is also called a pedal boat or pedalo.    

197
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,411
steered by rudder and gliding on two floaters,  

198
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,948
a paddle boat delivers a smooth, relaxing ride.    

199
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,150
boat mechanics don't get much simpler than this.     

200
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,954
in a typical two-seater, two sets of pedals,      

201
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,290
each powering a paddle wheel at the rear.          

202
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,492
the factory molds the top and bottom halves

203
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,427
of each floater separately.  

204
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,296
first, workers spray the mold with gelcoat,         

205
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,965
a type of polyester.      

206
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,768
this is the floater's surface finish.        

207
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,305
next, they cover the entire mold
with fiberglass cloth     

208
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:49,241
then add a second layer in the front and bottom    

209
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,777
where the floater will be a bit thicker.     

210
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,048
then they lower a cover onto the mold,         

211
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,518
latching it down securely to make the mold airtight.   

212
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:06,792
they draw a vacuum to extract the air trapped inside,    

213
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,194
then inject liquid resin.   

214
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,596
the resin saturates the fiberglass cloth 

215
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,533
and, within an hour, hardens, producing solid fiberglass,  

216
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,068
a lightweight material     

217
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,072
that's both impact-resistant and waterproof.        

218
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,741
after extracting this half,  

219
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,610
workers mold the other half of this floater        

220
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,413
and the two halves that make up the other one,  

221
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,783
then they apply fiberglass glue
to the edges...        

222
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,289
...and carefully align and mate
top and bottom.        

223
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,032
they position spacers     

224
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,834
to put pressure on the base of the groove,   

225
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,370
then clamp the perimeter for about 45 minutes      

226
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,172
until the glue sets.      

227
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,244
when the glue is completely dry,

228
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:03,782
they trim the perimeter to make
the edge neat and smooth.   

229
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,983
to make each propulsion wheel, 

230
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,454
workers rivet eight blades to a fiberglass hub.      

231
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,523
these strong plastic blades do have some flex in them.   

232
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,392
this ensures they won't break, 

233
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:18,196
should the wheel hit a rock or other obstacle.       

234
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,398
the part of the boat where you sit and pedal    

235
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,934
is called the bicycle.     

236
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,136
the two bike bodies, like the floaters,       

237
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,073
are made of molded fiberglass, 

238
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,275
then jazzed up with decals.  

239
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:42,754
since the bicycle mechanics are routinely exposed to water,

240
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,157
they must be rust-resistant.  

241
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,160
therefore, the pedal mechanism is made of chrome-plated steel 

242
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,628
and the chains         

243
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,698
of steel that's been treated with an anti-corrosion coating.

244
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,300
each bike has two chains --  

245
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,437
the first linking the pedals to one side of a central gear, 

246
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,374
the second linking the other side of the central gear 

247
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,442
to the propulsion wheel.    

248
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,310
so, once they're both hooked up,

249
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,314
pedaling moves the first chain,
which rotates the gear,    

250
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:13,251
which moves the second chain, which turns the wheel.     

251
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,653
final assembly is relatively simple.     

252
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,989
first, workers connect the floaters      

253
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,525
with three painted aluminum crossbars.      

254
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,128
the paint is baked on to make it extra durable.   

255
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,264
then, on one of the crossbars, 

256
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,800
they install a pair of aluminum rudders,  

257
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:32,003
the boat's steering mechanism. 

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,540
they link the rudders with an aluminum bar      

259
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,809
so that they move in unison.  

260
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,881
a hitch pin locks the bar securely in place,       

261
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,350
while this rubber cap prevents paint chipping    

262
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:49,087
when the rudders hit the crossbar.       

263
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,222
after mounting the first bicycle,       

264
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,292
workers install a console in the center of the boat.   

265
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,828
it contains          
a waterproof storage compartment

266
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,631
and the handle, which directs the rudders.   

267
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,801
it connects to the rudders   
with a long bar called a tiller.

268
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,578
next they mount the second bike.

269
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,113
like the first one,      

270
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,517
it's designed to snap securely onto the crossbars.      

271
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,588
the adjustable fiberglass seats
slide onto aluminum rails.   

272
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,726
the seats have fixed cushions and rugged, waterproof fabric. 

273
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,661
the boat's retractable canopy 

274
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:34,199
is made of the same fabric on an aluminum structure.    

275
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,667
a paddle boat is virtually maintenance-free. 

276
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,669
you just have to oil the mechanisms         

277
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,605
a couple of times per season, 

278
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,408
and from then on, it's smooth sailing.      

279
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,760
narrator: every home needs a tough exterior.    

280
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,429
fiber cement siding is a concrete option.     

281
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,832
made of cement, sand, and wood pulp,         

282
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:11,069
it's engineered to be fireproof,
insectproof, and weatherproof. 

283
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,239
embossed with various wood-grain patterns,      

284
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,209
it has a natural look that's big on the street.   

285
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,715
fiber cement cladding is a century-old product    

286
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,651
that was actually reinvented in the 1980s.         

287
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,520
asbestos was removed due to health concerns     

288
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,656
and replaced with wood pulp.  

289
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,126
the pulp provides the fiber that prevents cracking.    

290
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,729
production begins with silica sand.       

291
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,065
a loader shovels it into an underground conveyor. 

292
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,269
the sand particles, which are about the size of beach sand, 

293
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,538
are about to be ground down to a fine powder.       

294
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,409
the conveyor takes the sand up to a revolving cylinder grinder

295
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,944
called a ball mill --     

296
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:56,815
so named because, inside, steel balls tumble around   

297
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:00,618
to smash the sand particles into much smaller bits.    

298
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,154
they pipe in water to keep the dust down     

299
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,757
and eliminate the need for an exhaust system.     

300
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,092
this also liquefies the sand, 

301
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,628
making it easier to pipe it through the plant  

302
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,964
during the various stages of processing.         

303
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,968
but the sandy liquid needs to be thickened substantially, 

304
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,971
so it's into a tank to drain off much of the water.

305
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,374
what's left is about 80% sand. 

306
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,510
the next ingredient is wood pulp,         

307
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,446
which gives the cement siding bending strength.       

308
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,781
without it,          

309
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,652
the fiber cement siding would be
brittle and crack easily.   

310
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:37,655
they add water and stir to soften and liquefy the pulp 

311
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,924
so it can be easily pumped around the factory       

312
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,560
for processing.        

313
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,398
at the end of the mixing,   

314
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,467
the pulp looks like thick oatmeal.         

315
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:55,206
next, they lower cylindrical sieves into position.     

316
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,208
but first they blend together 

317
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,944
the liquefied sand, cement, and pulp,       

318
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,882
along with some additives, creating a fiber cement slurry.

319
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:09,086
they pipe the cement slurry into
a trough beneath the sieves.  

320
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,489
as the sieves rotate through the slurry,       

321
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,925
residual water drains through the mesh walls, 

322
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,361
leaving a fiber cement film on the surface.        

323
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,832
the film transfers to a felt belt moving overhead.

324
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,199
through the felt,       

325
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,436
a vacuum mechanism sucks more moisture from the film  

326
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,106
until it forms a solid fiber cement sheet.  

327
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,643
rollers squeeze numerous sheets together.   

328
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,778
they're still moist enough to stick together,       

329
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,581
and they fuse into one thick board.     

330
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,317
another roller then presses a woodlike pattern

331
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,586
onto the surface of the cement board.      

332
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,789
a spray of high-pressure water 

333
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,325
then slices the cement sheet into planks.          

334
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,598
a robotic suctioning head gently
picks up the fiber cement planks

335
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,334
and transfers them to a pallet.

336
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,470
the planks are fragile at this point         

337
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,505
and need to be handled with care.           

338
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,075
loaded into a pallet,     

339
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:09,146
the cement planks are now ready
for some toughening up.    

340
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,617
they bake the fiber cement siding inside steel tubes.   

341
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,453
they're autoclaves, high-pressure ovens.      

342
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,622
inside, pressurized steam   

343
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:21,626
enhances the chemical reaction between the ingredients    

344
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,295
to cure the cement clapboard. 

345
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:28,299
they then load the pallets   
of cement siding onto a railcar,

346
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,369
and it's on to the next station.

347
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,640
here, machinery does something they call stack breaking.   

348
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:39,644
during curing, the siding planks get stuck together,   

349
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,247
so these hydraulic cylinders lift and jostle them      

350
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,716
to separate them into individual boards.    

351
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,653
they put a siding sample to the test.          

352
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,122
with both sides of the board stabilized,    

353
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:55,126
a rod bends it at the center to determine the stress point. 

354
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,461
if it can take a lot of pressure,       

355
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,198
the whole production line moves forward.         

356
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,267
spaced apart now,       

357
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,736
the fiber cement planks ride by sprayers        

358
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:09,140
that paint the sides and the ends a nice shade of red. 

359
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,276
the siding then enters a curtain of paint 

360
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,077
of the exact same color.    

361
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,415
the paint adheres to the front of the boards.  

362
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,821
these mirrors expose any missed spots.    

363
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:26,391
if there are any, they'll do touch-ups.     

364
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,696
the transformation from a pile of sand and other ingredients  

365
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,499
to something that looks a lot like wood siding     

366
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,901
has taken just three days,   

367
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,170
and once installed,      

368
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,707
these wood-look cement planks could fool the neighbors.   

369
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:47,579
after all, it's all about putting up a good facade.   

370
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
