1
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,389
 narrator: historically, wheels 
  were made of metal or wood.   

2
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,724
       with the invention       
    of air filled car tires     

3
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,993
       in the early part        
     of the 20th century,       

4
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,528
 the ride was revolutionized.   

5
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,864
   the inflated rubber tires    

6
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,333
      could better absorb       
     the bumps on the road      

7
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,734
   and the addition of tread    

8
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,804
       gave the invention       
       serious traction.        

9
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:18,477
 car tires have come a long way 
     in the last century.       

10
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,613
     the modern summer tire     
          is made of            

11
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,881
10 to 15 different components,  

12
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,885
         which include          
 natural and synthetic rubber,  

13
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,622
      chemical additives,       
and carbon black -- a pigment.  

14
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,157
         giant blenders         
     mix these ingredients      

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,359
           under heat           
   and tremendous pressure.     

16
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:38,163
 there are various formulations 
   for different parts of the   
             tire.              

17
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,634
  in each case, the result is   
      gummy rubber dough,       

18
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,503
        which machinery         
    then rolls into sheets      

19
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,773
   to await further kneading    
        and processing.         

20
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,978
 polyester fabric unrolls into  
 a machine called a calender.   

21
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,380
          the calender          
   is equipped with rollers     

22
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:57,650
     that apply warm rubber     
 to both sides of the fabric.   

23
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:00,186
         this produces          
      a rubberized fabric       

24
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:03,255
       that will be used        
    to reinforce the tire.      

25
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,325
   this fabric ply is needed    
     because rubber alone       

26
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,528
      isn't sturdy enough       
        to make a tire.         

27
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,000
   numerous cotton cords now    
        spin off bobbins        
        simultaneously.         

28
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,670
   machinery pulls them onto    
 the warm, rubberized fabric.   

29
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:20,606
 they land on a bit of an angle 
          and adhere.           

30
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,211
 this cording creates channels  
     that provide pathways      

31
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:30,483
        for venting air         
     during the actual tire     
           building.            

32
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,485
     making rubber for tread    
            requires            

33
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,820
        three different         
     rubber formulations.       

34
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,956
        extruders shape         
  the three streams of rubber   

35
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,627
   and then they enter a die    
   that forms them into one.    

36
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,963
    mini paint rollers apply    
  different colored stripes.    

37
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,899
      it's a coding system      
      for identification        

38
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,901
       of the ingredients       
      during processing.        

39
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,506
  to avoid tension, the system  
  creates slack in the feed.    

40
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,842
    a blade slices the tread    
             rubber             
          to length.            

41
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:01,379
 next, many steel cables uncoil 
  at once to make the bead --   

42
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,049
    the part of the tire that   
              gives             
   it the strength it needs     

43
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,986
   to stay on the wheel rim.    

44
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:10,589
 machinery arranges the cables  
 in the desired configuration   

45
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,192
  and encases them in rubber.   

46
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,262
      more equipment rolls      
 the bead material into hoops   

47
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,064
  sized to fit the wheel rim.   

48
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,670
          they're now           
   ready to build the tire.     

49
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,006
using a special rotating drum,  

50
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:30,609
       a worker arranges        
   the two bead hoops on it.    

51
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,345
           next up is           
  an airtight piece of rubber   

52
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:37,683
 that will act as an inner tube 
  followed by the corded ply.   

53
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,553
       inflated bladders        
   roll the rubber around the   
              bead              

54
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:44,290
     on both sides and then     
            retract.            

55
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:48,494
            a server            
    applies side walls to the   
             beads.             

56
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:52,497
      little rollers fold       
the side walls over the beads.  

57
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:56,635
 this completes the inner part, 
   or skeleton, of the tire.    

58
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,505
         they assemble          
  the outer layer separately    

59
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:03,309
    beginning with strips of    
             rubber             
   embedded with steel cord.    

60
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,710
 the system wraps this rubber   

61
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,847
        around a second         
      tire-building drum.       

62
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,784
            next up             
   are narrow strips of rubber  
              ply.              

63
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:14,186
    the computerized system     
          winds them            

64
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,256
 with just the right amount of  
     tension for a graduated    
            effect.             

65
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,525
     they're now ready for      
       the last layer --        

66
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,594
       the tread rubber.        

67
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,330
   machinery applies it to the  
              ply.              

68
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:30,068
     it's time for the two      
   tire fabrications to become  
              one.              

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,738
        a transfer ring         
     collects the assembly      

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,541
        and transfers it        
      to the inner part.        

71
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,410
   compressed air inflates the  
              tire              
          to shape it           

72
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,814
   and all the sticky layers    
       adhere together.         

73
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,752
       the machine rolls        
 the edge of the tread rubber   

74
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,421
     over the side walls.       

75
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:53,158
 they now have what's known in  
  the industry as a green tire  
               --               

76
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,761
        an uncured tire         
    without tread pattern.      

77
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:01,867
     next, it's into a mold     
  to bake and shape the tire.   

78
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,840
 the two parts of the mold come 
 together like a waffle iron.   

79
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:11,176
  inside, hot steamy bladders   
   expand to shape the tire     

80
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,712
 and transfer the tread pattern 
            to it.              

81
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:18,450
  this specific tread pattern   
 is designed for summer tires.  

82
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,320
   this cutout of a car tire    
         demonstrates           

83
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,790
       how all the layers       
   have been fused together.    

84
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,858
            the time            
 in the hot, pressurized mold   

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,128
         has caused the         
    rubber to vulcanize --      

86
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,463
      a chemical reaction       
      that transforms it        

87
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,265
     from a weak and sticky     
           substance            

88
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,935
         to one that's          
      strong and elastic.       

89
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,737
 a worker trims excess rubber.  

90
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,672
     after final inspections    
            confirm             

91
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,075
   the tire shape is uniform    
  and geometrically correct,    

92
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,211
      the tire is ready for     
           shipment.            

93
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,848
    it's time for the rubber    
       to hit the road.         

94
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,698
           narrator:            
    silk fabric originated in   
             china              

95
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,634
   at least 5,000 years ago     

96
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,902
 and became a coveted luxury.   

97
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,305
          silk thread           
   is produced by silkworms     

98
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,773
 when they make their cocoons.  

99
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,508
         sericulture,           

100
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,311
    or commercially breeding    
silkworms for silk production,  

101
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,681
          is practiced          
  in several asian countries.   

102
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,388
        from home goods         
 to accessories and clothing,   

103
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,724
     there are few textiles     
   as elegant and luxurious,    

104
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,061
          or as prized          
 throughout the ages, as silk.  

105
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,997
      it's hard to believe      
     this beautiful fabric      

106
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,733
       comes from worms.        

107
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,469
      the female silkworm       
   lays up to 400 eggs in one   
              shot              

108
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,472
      then promptly dies.       

109
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:50,275
    each egg, about two weeks   
             later,             
     hatches into a larva.      

110
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,211
    the larva feeds on fresh    
 mulberry leaves continuously,  

111
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,615
   increasing its body weight   
          10,000 fold           

112
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,617
    and growing to a length     
    of about three inches.      

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,221
     then, as it enters the     
 pupa phase of its life cycle,  

114
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,957
  it excretes liquid raw silk   

115
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,026
      from salivary glands      
         in its mouth.          

116
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,629
     when that liquid silk      
    contacts with the air,      

117
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,699
    it hardens into a single    
            thread.             

118
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,235
         pupating larva         
    winds that thread around    
             itself             

119
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,639
  into a thick, cozy cocoon.    

120
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,109
           normally,            
the pupa inside becomes a moth  

121
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,511
         and the cocoon         
     breaks as it emerges.      

122
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,648
      however, this severs      
  the continuous silk thread.   

123
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,383
 so to keep the thread intact,  

124
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,319
      they boil the cocoon      
    for about three minutes     

125
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,988
    to kill the pupa inside     

126
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,724
           before it            
    transforms into a moth.     

127
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,995
   boiling the cocoons also     

128
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,731
     makes the wound thread     
       easier to unravel        

129
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,200
        by melting away         
    most of the sericin --      

130
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,136
     the gelatinous protein     
        that binds it.          

131
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,739
      to harvest the silk,      
       they take threads        

132
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,541
   from 30 to 50 cocoons at a   
             time.              

133
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,809
  they feed them all together   

134
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,878
         through a hole         
      in the bamboo stick       

135
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,213
  onto a hand-operated reel.    

136
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,751
  then, slowly and carefully,   
      they turn the reel,       

137
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:09,488
    unraveling the cocoons.     

138
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,223
 as the thread passes together  
      through the stick,        

139
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,094
     the remaining sericin      
      glues them together       

140
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,097
       forming a single,        
        thicker thread.         

141
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,569
     the silk threads coming    
            together            
        are so fine --          

142
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:27,305
  only about one one-hundredth  
of a millimeter in diameter --  

143
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,908
         that it takes          
    2,000 to 3,000 cocoons      

144
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,678
           to produce           
    a pound of silk thread.     

145
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,650
       unraveling cocoons       
 is a time-consuming process,   

146
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,052
    because a single thread     
       can be as long as        

147
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,522
    nine professional soccer    
            fields.             

148
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,259
   to make this feather-like    
 silk thread easier to handle,  

149
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,830
  they weigh it down with sand  
    before rolling it into a    
            bundle.             

150
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,806
      next, they wash away      
     the sand and remaining     
            sericin,            

151
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:04,743
     then bleach the thread     
  so it will uniformly absorb   

152
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:08,013
      the synthetic dye.        

153
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:12,284
    it's critical to monitor    
the ratio of dye to hot water,  

154
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,220
  as well as water temperature  
       and soaking time,        

155
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:19,224
 as all these factors combined  
    effect the quality of the   
             color.             

156
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,896
     after rinsing away the     
    excess dye with lukewarm    
             water,             

157
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,331
 they hang the thread to dry.   

158
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,440
     they mount the bundles     
   of dry, dyed silk thread     

159
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,708
       on a big machine,        

160
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,078
      which transfers them      
      to smaller rollers.       

161
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,321
       those rollers then       
  go on an automated machine,   

162
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,458
   which transfers the thread   
       to small bobbins.        

163
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,859
     to craft silk fabric,      

164
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,862
       weavers will pass        
bobbins of thread horizontally  

165
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,597
   between vertical threads     

166
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,867
       on a traditional,        
      hand-operated loom.       

167
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,737
  another machine, meanwhile,   
  winds thread around spools.   

168
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,740
     a worker then installs     
 a set number of spool threads  

169
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:09,942
        on a mechanism,         

170
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,010
  which aligns them vertically  
          on the loom           

171
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,146
    parallel to each other.     

172
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,881
         fabric that's          
     about three feet wide      

173
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,018
       typically requires       
    4,000 vertical threads.     

174
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,353
         by stepping on         
    the loom's foot pedal,      

175
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,024
  the weaver repeatedly raises  
 every second vertical thread,  

176
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,694
   and with a tug of a cord,    
       passes a shuttle         

177
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:32,764
 containing a bobbin of thread  
   horizontally in between.     

178
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,034
      this intertwining of      
     horizontal and vertical    
            threads             

179
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,236
    weaves the silk fabric.     

180
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,573
    to create a pattern, the    
             weaver             
    uses multiple shuttles      

181
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,710
      containing threads of     
            different           
     colors, thicknesses,       

182
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,778
         and textures.          

183
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,182
    some patters, such as an    
     intricate weave called     
            brocade,            

184
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:53,719
   are so intricate that even   
 the most experienced weavers   

185
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:58,389
 produce just two to six inches 
      of fabric per day.        

186
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,360
   now, that's wearable art.    

187
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,342
           narrator:            
    a centuries-old painting    

188
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,345
       easier to restore        
 than a decades-old painting.   

189
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,082
     for hundreds of years,     
 artists used pure oil paints,  

190
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,617
   but by the 20th century,     

191
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,486
      artists began using       
   different types of paint,    

192
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,857
       making restoration       
       more challenging.        

193
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,431
     a traditional painting     
  is typically oil on canvas,   

194
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,634
     protected with a layer     
   of natural resin varnish.    

195
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:46,238
   over time, a linen canvas    
      can become brittle,       

196
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,506
 distort, and sometimes tear.   

197
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:52,443
        varnish yellows         
 and dirt and dust accumulate,  

198
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,714
   rendering the once-vibrant   
    painting dark and dull      

199
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,650
      and in dire need of       
  professional conservation.    

200
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,321
    the conservation process    
       is multi-faceted.        

201
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:06,057
    they have to strip away     
   any previous restoration,    

202
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,193
       then perform a new       
          restoration,          

203
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:13,131
      yet make it entirely      
           reversible           
       to allow for future      
          restoration.          

204
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,400
        the conservators        
     begin with spot tests      

205
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,403
         to observe how         
     different colors in the    
            painting            

206
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,538
      react to cleaning.        

207
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,607
     they dip a cotton swap     
       in mild detergent        

208
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,809
        and rub gently,         

209
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:25,811
testing for discolored varnish  

210
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,413
 and any previous restoration.  

211
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,883
     when all that's done,      
   they swab on some solvent    

212
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,218
         to neutralize          
    the detergent residue.      

213
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,956
   next, they spray the back    
   of the canvas with water     

214
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,359
      and lie the painting      
    on a vacuum hot table.      

215
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,894
            the heat            
 turns the moisture to steam,   

216
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,364
         which relaxes          
      the paint and linen       

217
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:49,234
      as the vacuum pulls       
  the bumps and puckers flat.   

218
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,903
         if the canvas          
   isn't structurally sound,    

219
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,105
      they apply adhesive,      
     a synthetic backing,       

220
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,774
   then a new linen canvas.     

221
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,444
       with thermometers        
  monitoring the temperature,   

222
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,380
     the heat activates the     
            adhesive            

223
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:04,916
      and the vacuum draws      
           everything           
  taut against the hot table,   

224
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,519
   bonding old linen to new.    

225
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:12,390
 and the conservators can turn  
     their attention to the     
            artwork.            

226
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,993
         they begin by          
 mixing a cleaning solution --  

227
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,996
  1% chemical-grade ammonia,    

228
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,199
     20% strong detergent,      

229
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,268
        and 79% water.          

230
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:37,749
        they dip a swab         
   in the cleaning solution     

231
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,953
  and another in the solvent.   

232
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,690
    working a small area at a   
             time,              

233
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,091
       they gently glide        
  the cleaning-solution swab    

234
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,826
       over the surface.        

235
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,696
   it's critical not to rub,    

236
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:54,166
        as any abrasion         
   could harm the painting.     

237
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:58,236
   next, they gently roll the   
   solvent swab over the same   
              area              

238
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,573
         to neutralize          
the cleaning-solution residue.  

239
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,710
         they repeat the        
        solution-solvent        
    procedure area by area      

240
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,314
 until they've removed surface  
dirt from the entire painting.  

241
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,784
    then they start all over    
             again,             

242
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,720
       this time removing       
    old, yellowed varnish,      

243
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,524
         embedded dirt,         
   and previous restoration.    

244
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,526
    the cleaning completed,     

245
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,129
      they can now address      
    the tears and damages.      

246
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,932
  using a small pallet knife,   

247
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,868
     they fill the cavities     
    of the tear with gesso,     

248
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,205
      material that's used      
as a background for paintings.  

249
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,739
   this gesso is reversible,    

250
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,742
         meaning it can         
      easily be removed, if     
           required,            

251
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,079
 during a future restoration.   

252
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,814
     once the gesso dries,      

253
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,750
   they wipe away the excess    
      with a damp cloth,        

254
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,087
 leaving a repair that's flush  
 with the surrounding surface.  

255
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,291
           then they            
 seal the gesso with varnish.   

256
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,561
     this creates a barrier     
   between the existing paint   
             layer              

257
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,630
          and the one           
     they're about to add,      

258
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:02,967
      making it removable       
    for future restoration.     

259
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,436
    they retouch the repaired   
             area,              

260
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,707
            expertly            
     matching colors to the     
            original            

261
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:13,311
  and blending them seamlessly  
  with the surrounding area.    

262
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,713
      this process, called      
          inpainting,           

263
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,382
   is where the conservators'   
       fine-art training        

264
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,051
      is put to the test.       

265
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,193
  rather than use oil paints,   

266
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:31,062
       they mix pigments        
      with acrylic resin.       

267
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,166
      this produces paint       
   that looks just like oils    

268
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,400
        but is removable        
      with mild solvents        

269
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,637
        in the event of         
     a future restoration.      

270
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,812
       they brush varnish       
      over the inpainting       

271
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:49,948
   so that the sheen matches    
 that of the surrounding area.  

272
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,619
   and now, the final step.     

273
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,488
they spray the entire painting  

274
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,691
      with a light coat of      
   removable synthetic varnish  
              that              

275
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,893
   doesn't yellow over time.    

276
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,229
         this evens out         
   and protects the surface.    

277
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,165
    once the varnish cures,     

278
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,968
          the painting          
   goes back into its frame,    

279
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,071
          just the way          
     the artist intended.       

280
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,120
      narrator: underwater      
           exploration          
   was a shallow experience     

281
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,055
     until scuba tanks were     
           developed            

282
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,191
        in the middle of        
       the 20th century.        

283
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,726
  filled with compressed air    

284
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,462
        and attached to         
    a breathing regulator,      

285
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,464
   scuba tanks enable divers    
  to stay underwater longer.    

286
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,302
   this invention took diving   
     to a whole new level.      

287
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,209
    scuba tanks are a way to    
   bottle the air we breathe    

288
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,612
       and take it with us      
          underwater.           

289
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,747
 to make aluminum scuba tanks,  

290
00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,485
     they start with solid,     
    cylindrical chunks called   
             slugs.             

291
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,287
   the aluminum-alloy slugs     

292
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:05,624
         tumble around          
    in a perforated, rotating   
             drum,              

293
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,160
    which takes them through    
  a series of chemical baths.   

294
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,163
   the baths clean and treat    
  the surface of the aluminum   

295
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,967
      to prepare the slugs      
         for forming.           

296
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,838
       the operator loads       
the slugs into a feeder system  

297
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,240
      that serves them up       
         one at a time          

298
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,910
    to a hydraulic extrusion    
             press.             

299
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,313
      an extrusion piston       
        forces the slug         

300
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,450
 into a die inside the press.   

301
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,053
           it hollows           
    and stretches the slug      

302
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,523
    into the shape of a scuba   
             tank.              

303
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,259
            it takes            
   about 1,300 tons of force    

304
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,729
          to transform          
     a solid, short chunk of    
            aluminum            

305
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,666
      into a longer, hollow     
           cylinder.            

306
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,938
   the shaping process itself   
        generates heat,         

307
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,674
      making the aluminum       
  softer and more malleable.    

308
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,011
     the press establishes      
    the outer diameter of the   
             tank,              

309
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,681
 the inner one, and the base.   

310
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:06,484
          the process           
    takes just 20 seconds.      

311
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,086
  the freshly formed cylinder   
           now spins            

312
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,223
      as a roller applies a     
            lubricant           
       to the open end.         

313
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,162
     the machine ejects the     
           cylinder.            

314
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:23,101
       then it's over to        
   the hydraulic neck press.    

315
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,704
           this press           
forces the opening of the tank  

316
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,207
           into a die           
  to narrow it substantially.   

317
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,246
   this establishes the basic   
              shape             
    of the scuba-tank neck.     

318
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,182
   it still needs more work,    

319
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:40,585
   but first, the tank shape    
      must be firmed up.        

320
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:47,191
    they heat treat and then    
             quench             
the scuba tanks in cool water.  

321
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,329
 the shock of the rapid cooling 
     hardens the aluminum.      

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
     back to the neck now.      

323
00:18:56,002 --> 00:19:01,406
    a spinning, computerized    
             cutter             
         shortens it.           

324
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,942
then, another cutter moves in.  

325
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,612
          filings fly           
   as it carves excess metal    

326
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,482
        from the outside        
    of the scuba-tank neck.     

327
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,758
      a computerized drill      
     widens the neck hole       

328
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,862
       and cuts a pocket        
      for an o ring seal.       

329
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,835
 the next tool carves a thread  

330
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,571
      into the inside wall      
         of the neck.           

331
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,375
      the threaded profile      
  will allow for connections    

332
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:42,614
    to an air-fill-up valve     
 and to a breathing regulator.  

333
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,588
        every scuba tank        
       undergoes a test         

334
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,725
   to measure tank expansion    
        under pressure.         

335
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,260
   they fill each scuba tank    
          with water            

336
00:19:56,262 --> 00:20:00,598
 and place it in a test jacket  
that's also filled with water.  

337
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,868
  testing equipment increases   
    the pressure in the scuba   
             tank,              

338
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,272
 and the tank expands, placing  
  water from the test jacket.   

339
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,342
          by measuring          
     the displaced water,       

340
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,411
         they determine         
  the rate of tank expansion,   

341
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,649
    and if it's acceptable,     
      the tank moves on.        

342
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,289
        a scuba tank now        
 spins against a sanding belt.  

343
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,625
     this sanding gives the     
            exterior            
       a brushed finish,        

344
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,361
   which some divers prefer.    

345
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,234
  they etch the serial number   
     and other information      

346
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,737
   onto the upper part of the   
             tank.              

347
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:44,909
   for a more colorful look,    
      the factory applies       

348
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:50,181
 a vibrant, translucent powder  
  coat to the brushed finish.   

349
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,317
      the finish is purely      
           aesthetic.           

350
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,851
    aluminum doesn't rust,      

351
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,255
   so a natural finish would    
 weather underwater conditions  

352
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,491
  as well as the powder coat.   

353
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:06,965
 they bake on the powder coat,  
    giving the tanks a glossy   
             look.              

354
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,673
 these aluminum scuba tanks are 
      now ready to take the     
           pressure.            

355
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,475
      life is sure to be        

356
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,745
    one underwater adventure    
        after another.
