00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,906
captions paid for by discovery communications    

3
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,784
narrator: a hot rod is a normal car   

4
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,453
that's been radically modified 

5
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,721
to look snazzier and drive faster.       

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,725
some amateur mechanics tinker away at building one  

7
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,792
in their garage,        

8
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,195
while other car buffs custom-order one        

9
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,930
from a specialty auto shop.  

10
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,333
either way, hot-rod lovers are driven by their passion  

11
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,536
for these mean machines.    

12
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,009
hot rods are customized inside and out.        

13
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,277
the classic cars they start out as       

14
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,012
are pretty scarce these days, 

15
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,283
so specialty shops now design and build hot-rod bodies    

16
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:25,350
from scratch,         

17
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,353
using state-of-the-art technologies.         

18
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,290
it all starts with curved steel rails 15 feet long    

19
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,893
that form the basis of the chassis.        

20
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:40,165
every 12 inches, workers weld the rails to the car's frame. 

21
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:44,403
next they position cross members
to reinforce the frame.    

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,107
with utmost concern for quality control,      

23
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,310
they'll assemble and install by hand the transmission,   

24
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,846
the suspension, and the shock absorbers    

25
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,649
and weld those precisely aligned
cross members         

26
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,085
to the curved rails.      

27
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,593
elsewhere, someone polishes the stainless-steel wings,   

28
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,327
which have been laser cut.   

29
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,764
these wings make up the    
hot rod's signature front grill.

30
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,941
mounting the disc brakes onto such a high-end machine  

31
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,143
takes specialists.       

32
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,113
first, they screw the spindles to the suspension arm...    

33
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,784
...then grease the ball-bearing mechanism... 

34
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,890
...and finally block the disc brake with a cotter pin    

35
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,958
to fasten the pieces together. 

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,228
the brake system has four calipers, one per wheel.    

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,564
each one holds two brackets called the brake shoes.    

38
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,900
they close down on the brake disc       

39
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,703
to slow down and stop the wheel's rotation. 

40
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,040
a couple of slide pins lock the caliper into place.  

41
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,042
brake shoes are prone to wear, 

42
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:01,980
so their alignment and oiling must be perfect.        

43
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,649
time has come to install a hydraulic device       

44
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,586
that reacts to the steering wheel's movement,       

45
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,156
directing the tie rods to turn the front wheels accordingly.  

46
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,659
a pneumatic tool is used    

47
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,061
to affix the pinion of the steering mechanism.   

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,470
at every step, workers check and double-check each part.   

49
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,138
using a jack,         

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,741
they lift the differential housing into position.     

51
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,144
it anchors the rear wheels' propulsion system       

52
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,612
to the car's frame.      

53
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:38,617
they attach the suspension arms
to the axles at an angle.   

54
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,220
meanwhile, a painter sprays a coat of resin gel      

55
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,821
on the plastic molds      

56
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,691
with which they make the car's fiberglass body parts.     

57
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,426
the gel coating eases extraction

58
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,696
and gives the fiberglass a high-gloss finish.      

59
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,098
to mold the parts,       

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
a worker spreads resin on fiberglass cloth.      

61
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,504
they call this step "wetting the fiberglass map." 

62
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,642
they lay the map on the mold --
in this case, on a door mold --

63
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,646
then with a roller, carefully press out all the air bubbles. 

64
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,314
it takes about 40 minutes   

65
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,116
for the resin-impregnated map to solidify.          

66
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,186
extracting the body part is a tricky procedure.     

67
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,790
they hammer wood wedges in between the hardened fiberglass

68
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,193
in the mold.          

69
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,128
it's crucial to angle the wedge
just right.          

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,465
otherwise, the mold may collapse.     

71
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,134
it typically takes about 25 molded parts     

72
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,536
to make up a complete hot-rod body.    

73
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,006
after three week's work, final assembly begins.     

74
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,876
after the back panels comes the front,        

75
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,011
otherwise known as the nose.  

76
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,882
next come the fenders, then the stylish running board.

77
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,352
and no hot rod is complete without its signature grill.  

78
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,154
the windshield frame helps support the roof,    

79
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,024
or "carson top" in hot-rod lingo.       

80
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:57,129
the front hood completes this '37-ford-inspired body.  

81
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,899
it ships out without a paint job.      

82
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,903
that's because customization is
everything in the hot-rod biz. 

83
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,572
the buyer decides how to finish the car     

84
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,575
by choosing, for example, this retro dashboard      

85
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,246
designed to blend spectacularly
with the rest of the car.   

86
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,917
even car junkies can be forgiven

87
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,986
for struggling to keep up to speed      

88
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,057
with the ever-growing     
customization options out there.

89
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:31,663
from the engine to the rims to the seats to the chrome -- 

90
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,399
when it comes to customizing your hot rod,  

91
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,735
you're in the driver's seat.  

92
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,351
narrator: egg decorating is a craft   

93
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,951
practiced around the world for centuries.         

94
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,287
the ancient persians painted eggs for noruz,    

95
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,689
their new year celebration,  

96
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,824
a tradition that continues today.     

97
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,293
probably the most famous    

98
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,895
are the exquisitely decorated fabergé eggs,         

99
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,764
except they aren't eggs at all.

100
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,700
they're made from precious metals and gemstones.     

101
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,708
each one of these decorative eggs is a unique piece.    

102
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,711
the artist paints them, collages images and fabric,  

103
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,979
and creates jewelry and music boxes        

104
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,115
or hangs them as ornaments.  

105
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,451
she always works with real eggs

106
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:31,456
from birds like the rhea, the emu, geese, or turkeys.  

107
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,592
here, she selects an ostrich egg

108
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,229
and gently clamps it in place on an egg-marker stand.    

109
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,140
on the underside of the stand are a series of guidelines   

110
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,344
to help divide the egg into two or more equal parts. 

111
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,880
working with the pencil held in a brace,        

112
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,816
she divides the egg into four equal parts.     

113
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,226
then she draws a horizontal line
across the egg         

114
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,962
where she'll cut it in half to create a lid.        

115
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,965
she'll use a hinge to hold the lid in place,   

116
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,902
so first, she draws the contour...    

117
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:21,306
then a loose, wavy line    
all along the egg circumference,

118
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,376
using the pencil guidelines as reference.         

119
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:28,179
a rotating cutter equipped with a diamond dusted blade  

120
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,615
makes a cut where the hinge will be.    

121
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,459
the artist now prepares some five-minute epoxy glue.  

122
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,795
she has a neat trick to apply just the right amount.

123
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,864
she works with a strand of uncooked spaghetti,     

124
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,501
then sets the hinge in place. 

125
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,342
once the hinge has set, she cuts all around the egg,  

126
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,279
then opens and closes it to make
sure that hinge works properly. 

127
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,282
it's the first time she sees the egg's interior.  

128
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,551
if it needs cleaning, now's the time.        

129
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,486
though this artist often chooses

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,022
to leave ostrich eggs their natural color,      

131
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,291
here she's decided to give the lid        

132
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,026
a thin coat of acrylic paint. 

133
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,829
for the lower half, she chooses a dark tone.    

134
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,498
acrylic paint allows her to work quickly,        

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,535
as it tries in just a few seconds.     

136
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,374
next, she uses a special glue 

137
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:34,245
to collage strips of japanese rice paper onto the egg.    

138
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,383
she layers small pieces to   
achieve a tortoise-shell finish.

139
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,129
she's ready to set the egg on its stand,         

140
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,532
so she coats the rim with epoxy,
then sets the egg down,    

141
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,036
making sure the hinge is level with the stand's rim.     

142
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,475
the artist now turns her    
attention to the egg's interior.

143
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,211
she lightly glues perfumed cotton balls     

144
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,948
to fill out the top and bottom parts.   

145
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,951
then she applies glue along the inner rims      

146
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,021
and clips on a piece of ivory satin.        

147
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,624
by the time she makes it around both halves,      

148
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,426
she can remove the clips.   

149
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,129
the fabric now holds firmly in place.        

150
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,739
next, she glues a fabric braid to trim the satin's edge.   

151
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,779
here, the artist lays down a delicate strand of rhinestones.

152
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,247
she applies more glue     

153
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,151
to add another braid along the lower rim...     

154
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,590
...then places a final strand to complete the effect.    

155
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,264
she sets in a tiny rhinestone 

156
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,334
to decorate the metallic filigree that hides the hinges.

157
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,805
even the egg's underside gets special attention.     

158
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,273
she glues another filigree   

159
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,142
to cover the hole through which
they emptied the egg,     

160
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,478
then applies a water-based varnish.     

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,748
this strengthens the egg and gives it a glossy finish. 

162
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,751
here's the finished piece --  

163
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,219
a delicate jewelry box     

164
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,888
that opens with the help of a fine chain        

165
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,891
to reveal its satin interior. 

166
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,160
there's no end to the creativity

167
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,364
that goes into making these decorative eggs.     

168
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:38,069
this model even has a music box built in. 

169
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,649
narrator: precision tools that perform their tasks    

170
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,184
with split-second speed and accuracy          

171
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,920
are key in jobs where time is off the essence. 

172
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,390
take for example the nozzle at the end of a firefighting hose.

173
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,725
it allows a firefighter    

174
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,862
to regular the pressure of the water exiting the hose, 

175
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,065
no matter how confined or widespread the flames.   

176
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,805
a fire-hose nozzle isn't    
a simple point-and-shoot device.

177
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,742
it enables firefighters to tailor their tactics    

178
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,613
by firing water in a stream or flush.           

179
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:25,550
production begins with a long aluminum tube.   

180
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:29,287
a saw slices off 6-inch pieces called blanks.         

181
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,824
just one tube makes about 46 blanks.     

182
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,963
a robotic arms swoops down to transport them to a lathe. 

183
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,970
cutting tools form the valve body,      

184
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,373
which controls the flow of water.           

185
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,010
then they rough up the surface,
making it easier to grip.   

186
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,986
they make a ball groove on the outside rim       

187
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,055
for attaching the hose coupling.

188
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,124
next, they form the interior. 

189
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,793
technicians verify the inside shaping       

190
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,196
with computer-imaging software.

191
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,132
it's on to the milling process.

192
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,001
a computer-guided drill bores several holes      

193
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,003
for the nozzle and grip attachments.     

194
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,806
coolant washes away the metal chips        

195
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,942
and keeps the drill bit from overheating.       

196
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,346
the transformation from a blank to valve body   

197
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,082
is structurally complete.   

198
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,352
a laser now engraves the flow indication.      

199
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,825
workers install rubber o-rings 

200
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,962
on a mandrel shaped like the valve-body interior.    

201
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,429
the rings keep water      

202
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,166
from leaking out the side of the nozzle.         

203
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,168
they position the valve body over the mandrel        

204
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,072
and blow the rings into place with a blast of air.      

205
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,312
automated machines now mate the valve body    

206
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,982
to the nozzle's handle.    

207
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,455
a heated mold melts granulated rubber    

208
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,192
and casts it into ridges    
at the top of a rubber cylinder.

209
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,596
this makes the shaper, the nozzle's adjustable head  

210
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,400
that switches the water from  
a wide spray to a narrow stream.

211
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,869
workers snip off any excess rubber,       

212
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,639
then ensure the rubber is solidly molded.       

213
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,011
next, they apply grease to the inside         

214
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,947
to lubricate the parts and prevent corrosion.     

215
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,882
two more o-rings are inserted 

216
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,718
to keep water from leaking out under the shaper.       

217
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,156
using a specially designed spoon,             

218
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,893
they scoop up tiny, plastic ball bearings  

219
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,562
and drop them into a groove in the shaper.         

220
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,232
these allow the shaper to rotate easily.       

221
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,634
the shaper then goes over a barrel --        

222
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,237
a metal tube that helps form the stream of water.   

223
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,705
to attach it,         

224
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:04,509
they apply an adhesive to the threads on the shaper's base, 

225
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,145
then slide the part into place.

226
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,385
workers insert a pair of hard plastic balls into the shaper. 

227
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:18,055
these enable the shaper to glide
back and forth on the barrel  

228
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,158
to shape the water stream.   

229
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,995
now it's time to build the sub-baffle,    

230
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,865
the nozzle component that controls water pressure. 

231
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,601
first they insert a pressure-regulation spring  

232
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,869
into the baffle body,     

233
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,337
then snap on a knob,      

234
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,575
which changes between standard 
water pressure and low pressure.

235
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,646
the whole device slides directly into the barrel.   

236
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,891
on the other end of the barrel,
they screw on the valve body. 

237
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,228
a rotating wheel simplifies this process.    

238
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,632
they now affix a pistol-style grip.      

239
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:04,302
finally, the gasket grabber goes in.            

240
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,971
the steel screen keeps out nozzle-clogging debris   

241
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,706
coming from the hose.     

242
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,909
with the nozzle assembly now complete,         

243
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,379
it's time for what they call a damp run.          

244
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,913
workers check everything    

245
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,916
to ensure the nozzle performs its task       

246
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,485
at every twist and turn.    

247
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,192
from the old-fashioned nozzle to the modern variety     

248
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,996
that comes in an assortment of flows, pressures, and sizes,

249
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,599
the evolution of the fire-house nozzle    

250
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,868
is undoubtedly a lifesaver.  

251
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,348
narrator: when they make baseballs for the pros,     

252
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,549
they aren't just playing around.

253
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,153
they build these balls precisely
to league standards.      

254
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,690
and incredibly, those standards
date back to 1872.       

255
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:02,360
each ball is uniform in circumference and weight  

256
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,929
so the game is an equal contest.

257
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,571
crowds will go wild for these professional baseballs.    

258
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,308
and at the heart of each one is something called the pill. 

259
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,844
the pill is smaller than a golf ball.       

260
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,846
it's about 4 1/2 inches in circumference.       

261
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,517
inside the pill's rubber casing
is a sphere of cork.      

262
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,254
they pour latex adhesive    

263
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,291
over hundreds of pills loaded into a drum.      

264
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,398
rollers spin the drum to evenly coat the pills    

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,300
with the adhesive.       

266
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,738
this adhesive never dries out completely,  

267
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,474
and the pills remain sticky to the touch.         

268
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,346
next, they loop four-ply wool around the pill.        

269
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,618
this machine spins the pill to wind the yarn around it.  

270
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,354
this winding substantially fattens the pill.       

271
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,824
it's the first time a camera has ever been allowed     

272
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,560
to record this proprietary machine,   

273
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,896
so we can't show you all of it.

274
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,635
they wind a second layer of wool
around the pills.       

275
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:21,839
this yarn is three-ply, and it 
thickens the ball a little more.

276
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,240
for a third winding,      

277
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,978
they use another three-play yard, but it's a bit lighter. 

278
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,713
the various layers of yarn   

279
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,315
are what give the baseball resilience,          

280
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,086
so it springs back into shape despite being hit repeatedly. 

281
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,655
for the final winding,     

282
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,057
they use a much thinner poly/wool blend        

283
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,393
because its surface is smoother.

284
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,866
this wound pill is called the center.          

285
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:52,270
they weigh it and measure its circumference, 

286
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,073
which should be about nine inches.       

287
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,480
they add adhesive to a spinning drum,      

288
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,415
then load the centers into it. 

289
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,687
as the centers tumble, they absorb the glue,      

290
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,423
and the wound fibers adhere to each other.     

291
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,697
the centers air dry for 48 hours
but remain sticky.       

292
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,502
using this hydraulic press,  

293
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,171
they punch out figure-eight shapes from leather,      

294
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,573
complete with holes around the periphery,     

295
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,510
allowing them to be stitched into baseball covers.     

296
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,248
but first, they stamp the date and lot number onto them.   

297
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,852
then they wrap them in wet towels.         

298
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,989
the moisture will make the leather pliable enough to sew. 

299
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,396
they roll the water-based adhesive    

300
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,998
onto one side of the cutouts, 

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,267
which sticks to the moist leather.     

302
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,338
they press two cutouts to the center's sticky surface.

303
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,807
it's an exact fit.       

304
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,550
they clamp the leather ball  
in a vice, and it's time to sew.

305
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,884
working with two needles,   

306
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,354
the sewer pulls thread through the ball's center   

307
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,889
and up through the holes in the leather pieces     

308
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,959
to cross-stitch them together. 

309
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,495
he rubs wax on the thread to stiffen it,         

310
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,765
because if it slackens, it's more likely to tangle.  

311
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,967
when it comes to cross-stitching,      

312
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,104
these workers are in a league of their own.         

313
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:41,179
they make quick work of the 108 stitches in each ball. 

314
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,315
there are 350 sewers in this factory,        

315
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,185
and they produce 8,000 to 10,000 balls per day. 

316
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,453
that's a lot of home runs.   

317
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,729
the final stitch goes through the center of the baseball   

318
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,731
and out the other side.    

319
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:05,402
the sewer then pulls stitches into a "v" configuration    

320
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,506
to give the ball a consistent look and feel.  

321
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:14,745
the balls now roll into a press
that smoothes down the seams. 

322
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,415
smoother balls are harder to grip,      

323
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,351
and they make pitching a bit tougher for the pros.  

324
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,620
finally, a three-headed stamper
gives it the trademark,    

325
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,757
league logo, and the commissioner's signature. 

326
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,562
with drying cycles,      

327
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,898
it takes a week to make a professional baseball.    

328
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,369
it will be whacked and slammed out of the playing field.   

329
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,705
but that's life in the big leagues.
