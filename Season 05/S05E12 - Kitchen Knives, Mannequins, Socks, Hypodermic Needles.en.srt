00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,890
narrator: today on "how it's made"...     

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,760
kitchen knives...       

5
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,732
...mannequins...        

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,638
...socks...          

7
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,144
...and hypodermic needles.   

8
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,521
any good cook knows that you're
only as good as your tools,  

9
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,458
so using the right kitchen knife
for the job is essential.   

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,659
from chef's knives and cleavers

11
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,729
to boning knives, filleting knives,       

12
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,197
and paring knives,       

13
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,133
a serious cook buys only quality cutting utensils 

14
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,303
and stores them in a block to keep their blades sharp.  

15
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,477
today's blades are truly a cut above          

16
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,946
the stone tools the cavemen used.       

17
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,814
knife-making is now a science, 

18
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,618
producing tools that really give
you that edge in the kitchen. 

19
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,656
first, they roll out steel by the sheet from a big coil. 

20
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,760
then this machine, called a press,        

21
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,628
cuts out the blades with a punch.         

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,897
and it really does pack a punch.

23
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,833
it presses down with 110 tons of pressure   

24
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,503
in order to make these steel cutouts.      

25
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,840
next, things get really hot.  

26
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,043
they roll baskets full of the blade cutouts   

27
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,445
into a high-temperature furnace.

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,448
the blades bake at almost 1,600 degrees fahrenheit    

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,916
for 2 hours.          

30
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,785
this hardens the steel.    

31
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,059
out of the fire and into the freezer,     

32
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,861
the blades chill out at subzero temperatures --   

33
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,666
negative 56 degrees fahrenheit for two hours.         

34
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,569
this freezer is cooled by liquid nitrogen.      

35
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,116
now we have what they call "cold, hard steel."      

36
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,819
next, they douse each blade with water           

37
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,556
while a belt grinder smooths the back of the blade 

38
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,957
and sparks fly.        

39
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,094
continuous water keeps the steel cool and hard 

40
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,997
while a sander smooths the back of the blade.     

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,873
now a robot moves in.     

42
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,245
this robotic arm has vacuum grippers like an octopus.   

43
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,848
it picks up a blade by suctioning,         

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,118
then it transports it to a grinding machine.     

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,254
the machine grinds the blade to give it that cutting edge. 

46
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,990
water flows continuously through the grinder,      

47
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,659
again to keep the steel cool. 

48
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,337
the robot keeps everything moving,    

49
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,542
putting a paring blade through the grinder every 12 seconds.  

50
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,750
the automated process for this 
bigger blade is a bit different.

51
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,086
this robotic arm holds the blade in a grip,      

52
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,622
rather than through fast-action suctioning.    

53
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,491
that's because it takes more time to grind this big blade, 

54
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,093
called a cook's knife.     

55
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,896
so this arm holds onto this blade a few seconds longer.  

56
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,700
but if this makes you nervous, relax.             

57
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,703
the robot doesn't have a habit of dropping them.       

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,673
some blades require a personal touch,       

59
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,143
like this shiny chef's knife, used for chopping vegetables. 

60
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,914
the worker runs the blade over the grinding stone    

61
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,315
very carefully.        

62
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,517
this gives it a very thin edge.

63
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,630
then a laser burns the brand  
name onto the side of the blade.

64
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,540
next, a piece of wood goes into a clamp,       

65
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,909
and a router shaves it into the shape of a handle.  

66
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,415
the end of the blade now fits neatly into the handle.    

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,218
a worker clamps the knife onto a riveting machine.    

68
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,355
those things that look like bullets on an ammunition belt 

69
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,156
are actually the rivets.    

70
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,960
the machine forces the rivets 
into the handle from both sides.

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,697
the rivets lock together inside the handle       

72
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,266
so they can never be taken apart.          

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,170
now they grind down      

74
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,238
any protruding steel from the handle.        

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,442
this makes the wood flush with the steel from the blade. 

76
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,980
the piece of metal that extends
into the handle        

77
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,515
is called the tang.      

78
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,951
it gives the knife weight and balance.      

79
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,555
finally, they hone the knife  

80
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,224
between two stone grinding wheels.        

81
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,964
with this kind of an edge, these knives will slice paper. 

82
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,671
but these knives will do their best work on the cutting board,

83
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,007
where they'll make the cook's life easier and meals tastier, 

84
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,043
no matter how you slice it.  

85
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,226
narrator: they strike     
alluring poses in store windows,

86
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,228
motionless models flaunting the latest fashions. 

87
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,897
for clothing retailers,    

88
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,965
mannequins are a vital sales tool.    

89
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,702
they come in fixed or flexible versions,     

90
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,104
the bodies realistic or abstract.          

91
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,040
and they can be made out of a range of materials,  

92
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,542
from wood to fiberglass.    

93
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,515
meet lady swing and mr. x --  

94
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,318
not flesh and bone, but polyurethane foam.     

95
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,788
these fully flexible fashion figures        

96
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,391
start out as humongous blocks of soft polyurethane foam.   

97
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,661
using a band saw, workers   
divide them into smaller blocks,

98
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,330
about the size of a large refrigerator.    

99
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,533
a worker creates a pressed-wood mold      

100
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,401
using both a grinder and a sander          

101
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,870
to soften the inside.     

102
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,206
she applies a layer of putty over rough or damaged areas.  

103
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,409
this will harden and prevent the foam from clinging.    

104
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,077
she'll make separate molds   

105
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,547
for the arms, legs, head, and torso.        

106
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:59,150
a 3-square-foot slab of foam goes on top of the mold,    

107
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,620
then a slab of harder foam, called a pattern,       

108
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,022
on top of that.        

109
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,690
the foam layers and wood mold 

110
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,826
now go through what's called a pressure cutting machine.   

111
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,962
pressure forces the slabs together,   

112
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,232
while a thin blade slices the excess foam away.  

113
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,369
exactly how much pressure the machine applies      

114
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,505
is a closely guarded trade secret.         

115
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,442
the foam arms pop right out on the other side.       

116
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,784
for the head and torso,    

117
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:37,322
they use a foam slab measuring 58"x17"x5 1/2",   

118
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,391
and a foam pattern       
that includes shapes for breasts

119
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,793
and a belly button,      

120
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,229
and grommets to shape the nipples.     

121
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,668
this foam pattern is impressionistic.      

122
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,671
this mannequins are not meant to be anatomically correct.  

123
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,473
here's the pressure-cutting machine close up.       

124
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,076
nine rollers compress the mold,
soft foam,           

125
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,744
and pattern slabs together,  

126
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,480
forcing them through a paper-thin opening, 

127
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,517
and slicing away up to six inches of foam.   

128
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,354
true to form, lady swing pops up
on the other side.       

129
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,358
her flexibility is her best trait.       

130
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,227
she and mr. x are often displayed on sports equipment, 

131
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,296
like snowmobiles and bikes.  

132
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,766
their manufacturer first named them in the 1970s,       

133
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,101
and the monikers just stuck.  

134
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,639
workers inspect the mannequin and trim the excess material. 

135
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,040
they extract her easily    

136
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,310
because they sprayed the empty mold cavity with lubricant.  

137
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,446
next, a worker assembles    

138
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,247
a quarter-inch-thick steel skeleton         

139
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,382
to give the mannequin some structure.        

140
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,384
workers will insert the skeleton

141
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,121
between the half-sections of the foam body.       

142
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,790
a welder fuses together 16 joints           

143
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:50,328
in the ankles, knees, thighs, hips, elbows, and shoulders.  

144
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,931
another worker sprays slow-drying, water-based glue 

145
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:56,133
on the skeleton and on the foam
body sections that'll cover it.

146
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,469
this will make them adhere together snugly.    

147
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,073
the hand skeletons are thin and pliable, like coat hangers,

148
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,675
so they'll bend.        

149
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:09,480
a worker places the skeleton between the torso halves,   

150
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,416
positioning the foam so the edges meet evenly.   

151
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,286
these dummies don't come cheap.

152
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:18,089
they sell for between $600 and $800 each,         

153
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,490
depending on the market value 

154
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,225
of the foam's main ingredient, oil.     

155
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,427
still, that's a bargain    

156
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,696
compared to their more realistic-looking,       

157
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,832
but much less flexible, fiberglass cousins.      

158
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,369
they cost up to $2,000 each.  

159
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,515
after letting the parts dry and set overnight,     

160
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:47,152
a worker tests the limbs for flexibility.   

161
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,325
she joins together the lower leg portions.    

162
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,460
the skeleton protrudes at the heel          

163
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,596
so that it can be secured to the floor          

164
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,198
when the dummy goes on display.

165
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,468
now, here's a scene worthy of a horror movie.   

166
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,871
using an electric carving knife,

167
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,642
a worker slices of 2 1/2 inches
from the front of the head.  

168
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,413
she glues on a hollow face mask
made of plastic,        

169
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,016
using solvent-based glue for an extra-strong bond.   

170
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,818
next, they spray the mannequin 

171
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,287
with a flesh-colored water-based glue,       

172
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,089
then sprinkle it with a fine powder       

173
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,024
made of tiny cloth particles. 

174
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,627
this is called flocking.    

175
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,696
it takes 12 hours to dry and gives the mannequin     

176
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,166
a protective fire-retardant skin.      

177
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,436
this factory's flocking comes in 18 different colors, 

178
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,574
from a variety of skin tones to several vibrant colors.   

179
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,711
before lady swing makes her debut, a makeup session -- 

180
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,247
powder blush to color her lips and cheeks,          

181
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,450
and water-based paint on her eyes, lashes, and brows.

182
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,452
they add a wig, and voilà --  

183
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,222
she's ready for her date with mr. x.          

184
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,331
narrator: socks are something we put on without thinking.  

185
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,866
but consider this --      

186
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,337
the very first socks were strips of cloth or hide  

187
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,004
wrapped around the feet.    

188
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,207
imagine walking around in those.

189
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,542
thankfully, that's ancient history,    

190
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,880
and today's socks are much better for the sole.   

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,622
with so many styles and fibers for sock these days,      

192
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,358
it's no problem putting your best foot forward.

193
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,962
but you have to step into this room of knitting machines 

194
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,100
to truly understand what a science sock-making has become.

195
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,235
here's a machine with the top open       

196
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,771
so we can get a view of the knitting action.    

197
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,973
an automated whirling cylinder 

198
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:53,178
pulls yarn from spools through holes in metal spokes. 

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,981
little hooks on the needles grab the yarn.         

200
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,582
the hooks have latches.    

201
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,385
the latches open as the hooks snare the yarn  

202
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,455
and close as they knit so you don't lose a stitch.  

203
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,990
as you can see,        

204
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,592
this machine knits socks a lot faster than grandma,   

205
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,997
sometimes making over 360 pairs a day.     

206
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,133
as the layers are added,    

207
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,603
a sock emerges from a tube at the bottom.         

208
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,206
the knitting machine is fully computerized.     

209
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,208
it automatically switches to a different color of yarn  

210
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,244
to make a stripe or a company logo.       

211
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,617
now the machine changes gears to make a heel.        

212
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,620
it does a half rotation instead of a whole one     

213
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,555
to knit the heel shape.    

214
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,893
the needles go up and down as the latches open,      

215
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,129
and the needles pick up the yarn, pulling it in.    

216
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,798
knit one, purl two.      

217
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,172
here it is in slow motion.   

218
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,174
this is about the speed at which a human could knit at,

219
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,110
but this machine normally runs 

220
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,980
at a speed of over 200 revolutions a minute.      

221
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,983
a tension mechanism moves back and forth,     

222
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,986
keeping the yarn from going slack and getting tangled.   

223
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,455
now a sock shoots out of a vacuum tube,       

224
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,325
and a worker turns it inside out.      

225
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:18,196
she sews the toe closed and cuts off the extra fabric. 

226
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,332
then she turns the sock right side out again,     

227
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,935
and it's sucked up by the vacuum.         

228
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,739
next, the vacuum tube deposits the sock into a bin.      

229
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,074
the trapdoor on the end of the tube          

230
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,410
ensures that vacuum pressure isn't lost.          

231
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,350
but there's more than one way to close a sock toe --     

232
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,052
a more automated way.     

233
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,757
a worker slides the sock between two metal plates.   

234
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,825
pressure holds them in place. 

235
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,694
then a motorized conveyer system

236
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,030
transports the sock to a sewing head.       

237
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,033
a blade cuts off excess fabric,

238
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,835
and a needle goes up and down like an oil rig,        

239
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,706
stitching one row and then another as reinforcement.    

240
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,580
this automated system produces a finer seam     

241
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,450
than a sewing machine that's run manually.      

242
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,322
now that the toe is closed, a robotic arm moves in     

243
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,190
and feeds the sock to a set of rollers.      

244
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,126
a blade pushes the sock down  

245
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,263
while the rollers turn the sock
right side out.        

246
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,932
a vacuum chute fires the sock into a bin.   

247
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,906
then it's on to the rotary dying machine.  

248
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,009
he loads 1,800 pairs or more, 

249
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,612
depending on the size of the dying machine.     

250
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,347
the socks toss around     

251
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,150
in a bath of dyes, chemicals, and softeners.         

252
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,752
for athletic socks,      

253
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,688
they add antimicrobial treatment
to the mix.          

254
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,426
it will help prevent fungus or bacteria that cause foot odor. 

255
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,895
now they slide the sock onto a foot form        

256
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,865
made of polished aluminum that won't cause snags.    

257
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,638
the aluminum leg forms stretch the socks       

258
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,106
to the prescribed size     

259
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,577
as they travel down a conveyer belt into a boarding machine.  

260
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,179
the boarding machine is like a gigantic iron,        

261
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,648
and the heat seals the stretch in the nylon          

262
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,984
so the sock stays that size.  

263
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,790
once out, a robotic arm grips the sock  

264
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,326
and pulls it off the aluminum form.     

265
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,361
it's called a stripper.    

266
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,133
then an automated rack with protruding pins      

267
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,269
collects the socks.      

268
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,411
the worker removes them a bunch at a time,       

269
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,714
and the socks are ready for packaging.    

270
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,019
and then, all you have to do is pull up your socks.     

271
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,502
narrator: a hypodermic needle is the proper term       

272
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,304
for a syringe and needle.   

273
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,973
it's used to draw blood or inject medication.     

274
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,111
this indispensable tool was invented back in 1853,   

275
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,712
but it wasn't until 1954    

276
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,515
that mass-produced disposable syringes came on the market,  

277
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,117
developed for the vast immunization campaign      

278
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,853
against polio.         

279
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,328
a syringe may make you cringe, 

280
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,665
but the treatment it delivers could be a lifesaver.     

281
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,200
to make a hypodermic needle,  

282
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,269
they start with a flat strip of stainless steel.      

283
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,805
the milling machine rolls it into a tube shape.  

284
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,274
a laser welds the seam together.

285
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,676
but what makes the steel stiff enough to use      

286
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,344
is something called cold-work, 

287
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,348
in which they press the tubing through a die several times.  

288
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,085
this also slims the tube dramatically,         

289
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,755
so now you have a thinner, tougher tube.         

290
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,558
it takes about a couple of days

291
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,360
to turn this stainless-steel strip     

292
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,896
into a tube with needle potential.     

293
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,098
but it will have to be sharp to perform,          

294
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,901
and the next steps will focus on getting the steel tube   

295
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,937
to a point where it's more than just a blunt object.    

296
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,110
an electrically powered blade scores the walls of the tubes 

297
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,047
as rubber pads bear down and roll.      

298
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,382
this rolling causes the tubes to
finally break at the score line.

299
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,985
the tubes are being cut down to size --        

300
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,621
about two inches long.     

301
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,862
the tubes fall into a bin, a tangled mess.        

302
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,532
the bin, driven by air pressure,
agitates,           

303
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,801
and this shaking motion straightens them out.     

304
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,138
an operator bundles them together with a plastic band, 

305
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,941
but removes a few to check the specs.      

306
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,214
this micrometer uses laser light
to measure the outside diameter.

307
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,083
the tube is supposed to be 8/100 of an inch,       

308
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,885
and it's right on.       

309
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,154
next, a mechanically driven drum

310
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,490
rolls superadhesive tape onto the tubes.        

311
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,758
the tape will hold the tubes in place            

312
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,962
as more work is done on them. 

313
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,165
they razor cut five-inch strips
of the tape tubes       

314
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,168
so that there are about 100 tubes per strip.      

315
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,574
then they spray aluminum oxide on the ends of the tubes.   

316
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,842
this roughs them up      

317
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,445
so that the surface will be easier to work with.  

318
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,450
now they place the strips of  
tubes into the grinding fixture,

319
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,120
and then they snap it shut.  

320
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,858
coolant flushes over the tube tips       

321
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,127
as the fixture moves across a grinding wheel.    

322
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,197
the wheel grinds through the tops of the tubes, 

323
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,333
shaping them into a rough point.

324
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,970
this is only the first grind, so it's not yet needle-sharp. 

325
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,245
now the fixture rolls and rotates the tubes.  

326
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,416
then it's back to the grind.  

327
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,618
the angle of the wheel is changed           

328
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,688
so that it sands the sides of the tubes.    

329
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,357
these two secondary grinds   

330
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,260
sharpen the tubes into a finer point.      

331
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,898
this is how they look before grinding,        

332
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,234
and this is after, with their sharp needle tips. 

333
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,973
now it's time for the big inspection.    

334
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,575
she pushes the ends of the needles    

335
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,578
with the back of her tweezers to make sure they're even,   

336
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,714
and then pulls out a needle for sampling.     

337
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,317
she measures the length of the grind.    

338
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,319
it should be a few hundredths of an inch long.        

339
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,590
next, she sizes up the needle's outside diameter 

340
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,124
with a micrometer.       

341
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,526
holding the needle between posts,         

342
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,596
it measures the space between them.         

343
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,398
then she checks the inside diameter      

344
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,801
by inserting a plug gage into the tube.         

345
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,205
now she inspects a whole bundle of needles   

346
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,775
for irregularities or burrs.  

347
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,080
using tweezers, she removes one

348
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,282
for a closeup look under the microscope.     

349
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,819
once they pass inspection, it's on to the big wheel,    

350
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,154
or the automated assembly machine.  

351
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,024
brass- and nickel-plated fittings, called hubs,     

352
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,093
drop onto pins on the wheel.  

353
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,363
then needles fall into the hubs.

354
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:37,434
metal fingers align them so they fit together precisely.

355
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,636
the hub is the piece      

356
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,638
that will connect the needle to the syringe.        

357
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,375
automated crimpers press the needle into the hub. 

358
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,112
sheer friction bonds them.   

359
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,781
now two metal pads on the same wheel        

360
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,450
position the needle.      

361
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,386
a plastic sleeve drops down, encasing the pointed tip.   

362
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,324
finally, a robotic arm lifts the needle off the wheel    

363
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,326
and drops it into a bin.    

364
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,594
the needles are now ready for you,     

365
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,764
but are you ready for them?  

366
