captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,919
narrator: liquid medication used to always come in a bottle,             

4
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,855
and you had to pour your dose with a steady hand   

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,324
into a spoon.          

6
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:01,193
today, many medications and supplements         

7
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,529
come inside small food-safe casings     

8
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,431
that are easy to swallow and portable --         

9
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,634
soft gel capsules.        

10
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,806
many types of products come in gel capsules,      

11
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,408
from prescription drugs     

12
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,210
to health supplements such as fish oils.        

13
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:22,014
many of these medicine fills go bad if exposed to oxygen,   

14
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,817
so the gel cap, besides being convenient,    

15
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,353
also serves as a protective barrier.     

16
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,688
every ingredient in both the gel cap       

17
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,624
and the medicine fill inside   

18
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,160
undergoes extensive testing for purity.  

19
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:38,430
the first test phase checks for bacterial contamination.   

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,767
lab technicians dissolve the ingredients in solution,   

21
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,703
apply it to a food source in a petri dish,         

22
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,839
then incubate the dish for 72 hours      

23
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,775
to encourage          
any existing bacteria to grow.  

24
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,379
then they draw samples and examine them under a microscope.           

25
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,848
if those samples are bacteria-free,        

26
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,184
the ingredient moves on to the second phase of testing,            

27
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,454
which checks for contaminants such as lead, arsenic,      

28
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,457
mercury, and cadmium.      

29
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,992
this machine, called a spectrometer,      

30
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,329
injects the ingredient solution into a plasma flame,       

31
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:14,066
then, by reading the changes in light wavelengths,      

32
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,202
analyzes the chemical composition.    

33
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:18,070
if the ingredient is contaminant-free,       

34
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,006
it gets the go-ahead.      

35
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:23,609
the gel cap is made entirely of natural ingredients --    

36
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,012
gelatin derived from beef bones,         

37
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,148
palm oil glycerin,        

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,083
and purified water.       

39
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,352
the proportions are top-secret.           

40
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:37,223
an industrial blender combines the three ingredients      

41
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,957
to a uniform consistency,    

42
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,361
then heats the mixture to 175 degrees fahrenheit.    

43
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,363
a vacuum sucks out the air bubbles         

44
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,034
as this now-ready gel material flows into a holding tank.    

45
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,369
simultaneously, they prepare the medicine fill --       

46
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,373
in this case, vitamin d.     

47
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,508
they combine it with soybean oil               

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,044
to adjust the potency to the specified strength.    

49
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,782
meanwhile, they maintain the gel-cap material       

50
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,985
in the holding tank at 140 degrees fahrenheit    

51
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,320
to prevent it from prematurely solidifying.  

52
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,590
even the hose leaving that tank is wrapped in heater tape    

53
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,726
to keep the gel liquid.     

54
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,795
a separate hose feeds the vitamin d solution      

55
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,264
from another holding tank    

56
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,265
down to the production floor, as well.             

57
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,935
this hose doesn't require heating         

58
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:27,873
because vitamin d and soybean oil don't solidify when cool.  

59
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,676
on the production line, two stations simultaneously   

60
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,279
spread a thin layer of molten gel          

61
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,814
across a cooling drum.      

62
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:38,417
the gel hardens into a solid, yet malleable, sheet  

63
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,553
about the thickness of cardboard.          

64
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,088
each sheet passes over a rotating die          

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,891
with capsule-shaped cavities.  

66
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,160
just before the two gel sheets come together,          

67
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,563
pumps inject the required quantity      

68
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,566
of vitamin d solution into each cavity,        

69
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,968
the pressure pushing the gelatin into the cavity.   

70
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,304
at the same time, the machine heats the gel sheets             

71
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,441
so that when they meet, they adhere to each other,    

72
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,909
forming full capsules      

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,712
with the vitamin d solution sealed inside.          

74
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,113
in the final second,       

75
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,183
the die's sharp edges slice the gel caps free,        

76
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,852
and they fall to a conveyer belt below.    

77
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,320
at this point,          

78
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,856
the filled gel caps contain a fair bit of moisture,     

79
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,192
so they're quite soft.      

80
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,127
if they lay on a surface too long,      

81
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,596
they'd flatten,         

82
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,397
so the conveyer belt whisks them very quickly           

83
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,132
into a rotating drum,      

84
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,535
where they tumble in slightly cold, dry air    

85
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,737
for about three hours.      

86
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,274
this removes enough moisture to make the gel caps hard enough             

87
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,077
to lie on a surface without flattening.       

88
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,615
after exiting, the gel caps move into a second dryer,       

89
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,817
where,             
spread out on trays this time,  

90
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,686
they dry for about 36 hours.   

91
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,021
after that,           

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,358
the gel caps are hard enough to be safely packaged.      

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,094
the gel caps --         

94
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:58,296
the ones being packaged here contain flax oil --       

95
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,432
travel down a series of vibrating plates,       

96
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,769
which progressively line them up in single file.         

97
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,638
as they pass by,         

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,707
electronic eyes count out the number            

99
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,309
of capsules per bottle,     

100
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,178
triggering the filling mechanism to collect that quantity     

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,848
and release it into an empty bottle.      

102
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,658
the next station applies a plastic twist cap,       

103
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,128
then the bottles move onward,  

104
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,597
each one plowing directly into the center     

105
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,399
of an adhesive-backed label,   

106
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,336
which rollers then apply around he sides.         

107
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,537
before shipping,         

108
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,206
the quality-control lab tests random samples          

109
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,741
from the production batch    

110
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,111
to verify that the gel caps meet all specifications.     

111
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,295
narrator: it's a playground staple --   

112
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,898
a stationary ride-on cartoon animal      

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,767
that bounces up and down and rocks back and forth,    

114
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,169
courtesy of a huge spring underneath     

115
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,771
secured into the ground.     

116
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,708
the bouncy coil base is what gives this type     

117
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,677
of playground equipment its name -- a spring rider.   

118
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,784
the spring rider is a playground favorite.    

119
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,987
to withstand years of rambunctious riders,     

120
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:30,389
it has to be solid and durable,            

121
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,592
yet for a toddler to be able to rock back and forth,     

122
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,260
it can't be too heavy.      

123
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,930
that's why the spring is made of thick steel,         

124
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,599
and the animal of lightweight aluminum.     

125
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:45,404
that sand core is comprised of two halves,   

126
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,740
each made with an aluminum mold --     

127
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,475
duck-shaped in this case.    

128
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:52,611
workers fill it with sand and adhesive mix    

129
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,480
that sets into a solid block.  

130
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:58,483
they insert several steel support rods,   

131
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:03,221
fill to the top, and even out the surface,    

132
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,824
then expose two hooks they'll later grab        

133
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,894
to extract the core half once the sand hardens      

134
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,495
in about 20 minutes.       

135
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:14,099
meanwhile, other workers use an aluminum pattern       

136
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,568
to make each half of the duck casting mold.    

137
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,038
after applying a powder release agent      

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,507
to prevent sticking,       

139
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,442
they cover the pattern      

140
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,779
with a sieved mixture of sand and clay.        

141
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,381
they mount a frame around the pattern        

142
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,849
to contain the sand,       

143
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,518
as they add more and more,    

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,120
repeatedly packing it down in all areas           

145
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,857
with a pneumatic ramming tool.  

146
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,259
then they remove the frame    

147
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,795
and cover the sand with a wooden board.       

148
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,998
this provides a hard surface for the press,  

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,068
which now applies the weight of about four mid-sized s.u.v.s.            

150
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,203
then they flip over the mold   

151
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:56,141
and remove the pattern which formed the mold cavity.  

152
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,410
the sand is now so firmly compacted    

153
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,478
that it holds the shape.     

154
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,749
one half of the sand mold has channels           

155
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,818
through which the molten metal will flow into the cavity.    

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,956
workers now position several quarter-inch-thick foam spacers             

157
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,324
in the cavity          

158
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,626
and place half of the core on top of them.              

159
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,895
the spacers elevate the core,  

160
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,566
creating a quarter-inch cavity between core and mold.      

161
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:23,469
the other half of the core goes on top.           

162
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,040
after placing spacers on top of that          

163
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:31,443
to create a quarter-inch gap on this side, as well,      

164
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:34,980
they carefully lower the other half of the sand mold.              

165
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,582
now they're ready to cast the duck.        

166
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,518
the melting point of aluminum  

167
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,721
is just over 1,090 degrees fahrenheit.    

168
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,858
however, they heat much higher, to 1,400 degrees,        

169
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,727
so it'll flow faster and fill the entire cavity    

170
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,731
before beginning to solidify.  

171
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,000
they pour the metal through holes on top.      

172
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,869
it flows through the runners into the mold cavity,      

173
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,471
which is that quarter-inch gap  

174
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,473
surrounding the duck-shaped core.      

175
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:07,212
about 20 minutes later, the metal has cooled and solidified.           

176
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,281
they break the mold apart on a vibrating sieve,      

177
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,485
releasing the aluminum duck and shaking out the core sand  

178
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,020
through a hole at the bottom of the duck.    

179
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,022
after cutting off excess aluminum         

180
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,691
that hardened in the runners,  

181
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,160
they grind down the seam,    

182
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,497
which formed in between the two halves of the mold.   

183
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,233
next, they weld on aluminum handles         

184
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,836
for the child to grip when riding.       

185
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,573
these handles are cast in    
sand molds just like the duck.  

186
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,245
workers grind down the weld and any sharp edges,  

187
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:46,185
making the entire surface nice and smooth.         

188
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,721
next -- a coat of polyester powder    

189
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,859
in bright rubber-ducky yellow.  

190
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,262
then -- a 20-minute trip through an oven         

191
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:01,066
to bake the coating, making it ultra-durable.     

192
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:06,338
now, delicately airbrushed with the urethane enamel paint,             

193
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,007
the details           
that bring mr. duck to life --  

194
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,744
his feet, wings, bill, and eyes.              

195
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:17,216
the thick coil         
that makes this a spring rider  

196
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,285
is made of a flexible type of steel.   

197
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,455
they bolt a steel spacer plate to it...  

198
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,694
...then hide the bolts under an aluminum cover.     

199
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:34,833
after attaching a foot rest -- steel, again --         

200
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,903
they bolt the duck to the plate.             

201
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:41,839
all these parts, like the duck, are painted    

202
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,776
with baked-on polyester coating.            

203
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:48,514
the spring bolts to a concrete block buried underground.    

204
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:51,716
ducky and friends are designed to withstand    

205
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,251
even the harshest winters,    

206
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,055
letting children enjoy a little spring all year round.             

207
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:15,206
narrator: early versions of pancakes were thin like crepes.             

208
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:19,478
by the 1780s, american cooks were adding a leavening agent  

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,748
for a fluffier, more filling pancake.      

210
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,017
that's when pancakes transitioned from side dish   

211
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,254
to main course         
for the first meal of the day.  

212
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:37,495
call them hot cakes, griddle  
cakes, flapjacks, or pancakes,  

213
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,566
there's nothing         
like a heaping helping of them  

214
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,967
splashed with syrup.       

215
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,635
and with frozen pancakes,    

216
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:47,206
whipping up some for breakfast has never been easier.      

217
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,111
pancake production starts off with a leavening agent --    

218
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,646
the baking powder.        

219
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,250
they combine salt, whey, and various flavorings      

220
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,584
in a big blender         

221
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,120
to create a dry-ingredient premix.     

222
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,993
since these will be buttermilk pancakes,       

223
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:13,065
they add powdered buttermilk for flavor.             

224
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,401
they now pump liquid ingredients from storage tanks        

225
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,769
into a huge blender.       

226
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,608
these include water and eggs,  

227
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,612
sweet cream, liquefied sugar,  

228
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,347
and soybean oil.         

229
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,882
they add the dry premix and flour     

230
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:34,353
until the batter reaches the desired consistency.     

231
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:37,222
an employee tests the batter's viscosity      

232
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,225
by pouring some in a device with a little gate.              

233
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,229
he opens the gate and measures the flow down a ramp.      

234
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,965
if it runs too thick or too thin,      

235
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,834
it won't produce pancakes    

236
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,770
that are the desired diameter and uniformity.         

237
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,706
the pancake batter passes the viscosity test.       

238
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,442
they release the batter from the holding tank,      

239
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,078
and it flows into a depositor system.     

240
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,116
the depositor has nine nozzles.            

241
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,321
each nozzle shoots an exact amount of the pancake batter   

242
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:13,725
onto a hot moving griddle.    

243
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,460
because of the perfect viscosity,      

244
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,865
each deposit of batter radiates out to form a neat, round shape,             

245
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,801
each one the same size as the next --          

246
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,671
about four inches in diameter.  

247
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:31,343
they run three depositors and  
moving griddles simultaneously  

248
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,279
to produce 750 pancakes a minute.      

249
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:38,250
that's an incredible 45,000 pancakes an hour.     

250
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,222
after several seconds on the griddle,         

251
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,890
one side is cooked,       

252
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,962
so automated stainless-steel spatulas flip the pancakes over.              

253
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,698
there are two sets of flippers.            

254
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,035
after flipping, the first set repositions,    

255
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,771
and the second set flips the next row of pancakes.    

256
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,275
it's mechanized synchronization.        

257
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:09,581
the flippers are spaced apart exactly as the depositors are  

258
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,651
so the pancakes arrive at the flippers in the correct order  

259
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,821
to be picked up and turned over.              

260
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,392
once flipped,          

261
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,727
the pancakes continue along the cooking conveyer,   

262
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,529
and the other side is cooked.  

263
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,534
it's a short ride for these pancakes        

264
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,403
to be completely cooked.     

265
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,808
from dollops of batter      

266
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,611
to uniformly rounded and cooked pancakes,       

267
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:43,014
this process has taken just 90 seconds.         

268
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,085
the pancakes somersault off the cooking griddle       

269
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,422
and over a roller to land on the next conveyer.  

270
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:54,892
the somersault exit has a purpose.          

271
00:14:54,894 --> 00:15:00,565
it keeps the pancakes from folding over so they land flat.              

272
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:06,571
hot off the griddles, the pancakes cool down on the ride,              

273
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,374
as all three production lines merge              

274
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,209
and head into a freezer.     

275
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,784
inside the freezer,       

276
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,519
it's a very frigid minus-18 degrees,        

277
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:25,356
and the pancakes freeze fast.  

278
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,860
now it's over to the packaging line.      

279
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,263
this is where the uniformity of these pancakes pays off.   

280
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,201
their similar diameter means they can be neatly packed    

281
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,703
in groups of six.        

282
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:47,012
machinery seals two stacks of six frozen pancakes      

283
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:51,216
in one wrapping.         

284
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,418
it has taken less than five minutes      

285
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,687
to prepare, freeze, and package these pancakes.   

286
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,424
at home, prep time in the microwave    

287
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,025
should be mere seconds.     

288
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:05,063
just add syrup, and       
this story has a sweet ending.  

289
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:24,716
narrator: natural rubber comes from the  

290
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,183
thousands of years ago,     

291
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,854
the native people of central and south america   

292
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,990
discovered that the hardened sap was elastic and bounced.     

293
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,459
they played games with the balls of sap.      

294
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,928
when european explorers came along,           

295
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,397
it was soon a whole new ball game.      

296
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,870
today, we make thousands of useful things    

297
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,274
from the fluid that circulates through rubber trees --     

298
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,476
everything from tires to balloons to boots.      

299
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,879
the seeds are sewn on plantations          

300
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,147
like this one in thailand.    

301
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,820
it takes several years for the rubber trees to mature,             

302
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,289
then the sap is ready to tap.  

303
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,693
in the coolness of the morning, when the sap flows freely,    

304
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:13,431
the farm worker slashes the bark with a hook blade.   

305
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,634
the sap oozes from the abrasion.            

306
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,169
it spills onto a metal spout   

307
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,972
inserted below the slashed section.    

308
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:26,778
the spout funnels the sap into a ceramic cup below.    

309
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,581
it flows for about five or six hours,   

310
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,516
partially filling the cup.    

311
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,653
they wait a couple of days for the tree to recover     

312
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:37,789
and then tap another section of the tree.   

313
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,726
after straining impurities,   

314
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:46,398
they pour the rubber sap into a plastic tub.       

315
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,136
they add formic acid and swish it around.       

316
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:54,005
the acid causes the sap to coagulate.      

317
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,275
after 15 to 30 minutes,     

318
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:03,081
it thickens to the consistency of tofu.   

319
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,684
this tofu-like sap has a sticky structure        

320
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:11,022
that allows it to now be rolled out like dough.             

321
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,558
the rolling squeezes out excess water           

322
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,293
and leaves           
a ribbed pattern on the sheets  

323
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,964
that increases the surface area to hasten drying.        

324
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:24,102
then they rinse off the formic acid.         

325
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:28,973
they hang the rubber sheets to dry for about five hours.   

326
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,978
as they dry, the rubber thickens and becomes stronger,      

327
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,246
and the color darkens.      

328
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:39,050
the coagulated rubber sap has been transformed.      

329
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:43,588
in a few short steps, it's gone from a liquid to a solid.    

330
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,724
workers pile          
the rubber sheets onto pallets  

331
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,128
and weigh the load.       

332
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,867
there's a little over a ton and a half of rubber in this stack.             

333
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,335
they store the stacks in a warehouse    

334
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,871
until the next stage of processing.          

335
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,407
when they're ready to move on,  

336
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,211
workers peel each sheet from the stack    

337
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,813
and soak them in water for about 20 minutes.      

338
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,883
this washes away some of the surface contaminants,   

339
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:12,917
but not all.           

340
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,624
the rubber sheets then go into a machine with many brushes             

341
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,227
that scrub off more of the dirt.              

342
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:29,901
after one more rinse, the rubber sheets are squeaky-clean.         

343
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:34,505
as you can see, the color of the rubber sheets vary somewhat            

344
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,509
depending on the tree they came from,   

345
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,577
their thickness, and other factors.        

346
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,051
they hang the sheets on racks to drip dry.              

347
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,358
next, they build a fire in a brick oven      

348
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,461
and smoke the rubber sheets in a chamber overhead      

349
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,264
for five days.          

350
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,133
it's a slow, low-temperature smoking     

351
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:06,371
that preserves the sheets    
to prevent the growth of mold.  

352
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,745
after smoking, they clip out contaminants    

353
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,682
like bark or insects that have 
become imbedded in the rubber.  

354
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,085
in many cases, they can't get it all.      

355
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,089
they grade the rubber sheets by examining them        

356
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,091
against a bright light.     

357
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,427
sheets with fewer remaining contaminants      

358
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,262
receive a higher rating     

359
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,364
and will command a better price.             

360
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:39,170
they stack the sheets according to the grade,     

361
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:43,541
and then it's into a hydraulic bailer.  

362
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:48,713
it presses the stack of rubber sheets into cube form.  

363
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,117
the dimensions of the cubes   

364
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,987
conform to international packaging regulations      

365
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:59,390
so they'll fit neatly into containers for shipping.  

366
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,326
they spray the rubber cubes   

367
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:04,529
with a mix of calcium carbonate and solvent.           

368
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,531
the mixture forms a film on the cubes       

369
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,631
that prevents mold        

370
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,000
and keeps them from sticking together      

371
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:11,202
during transport.        

372
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:14,405
this rubber is now ready for the next factory       

373
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,875
and the next transformation.   

374
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,943
it could become almost anything.            

375
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,553
