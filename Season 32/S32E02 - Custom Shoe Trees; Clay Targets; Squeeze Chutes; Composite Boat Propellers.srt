      at regular intervals      

124
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,773
     to time the injections     
  into the target-shaped molds. 

125
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:31,376
the machine compresses the paste
   while cooling it with water  

126
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,312
     so that it solidifies.     

127
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,383
    a transfer distance moves   
        the targets on to       

128
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,853
 a conveyer belt one at a time. 

129
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,055
    as they move to the next    
         conveyer belt,         

130
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:47,059
      the molds are flipped     
         right-side up.         

131
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,394
      even though the molds     
         are still hot,         

132
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,663
      they've remained soft     
          and pliable.          

133
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,269
     as the targets continue    
       to cool and harden,      

134
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,472
    a separating device lines   
 them up for the conveyer belts 

135
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,641
 that go to the paint chambers. 

136
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,348
   the paint is made primarily  
          of carbonate          

137
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,850
        and biodegradable       
        powdered pigment.       

138
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,156
      a technician pours a      
 pre-measured amount of water...

139
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,428
     ...and a bag of pigment    
          into a mixer.         

140
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,333
       the mixer combines       
    the ingredients together.   

141
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,706
   once the water and pigment   
     have blended together,     

142
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,843
    a pre-measured amount of    
carbonate is added to the mixer,

143
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,779
      along with a binding      
      and thickening agent.     

144
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:45,317
   after additional blending,   
       the paint is ready.      

145
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:46,985
    the targets move from the   
          conveyer belt         

146
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,720
     onto spinning holders,     

147
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,323
     which carry the targets    
   through the paint chamber.   

148
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,931
     inside, a sprayer coats    
the spinning targets with paint.

149
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:05,070
  the targets exit the chamber  
         wet and cooled.        

150
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,610
    another separator divides   
        the targets on to       

151
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,746
       two conveyer belts,      
    which carry them through    

152
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,417
 a hot-air tunnel for 30 seconds
        to dry the paint.       

153
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,357
     the conveyer belt feeds    
    the targets to a machine,   

154
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,559
   which piles them in stacks.  

155
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:35,567
       clay pigeons can be      
 manufactured in several sizes. 

156
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,504
     olympic regulation size    
         is the largest,        

157
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,006
       containing a width       
         of four inches.        

158
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,579
    a smaller target is used    
      for training purposes     

159
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:52,184
      and contains a width      
       under four inches.       

160
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,119
    regardless of their size,   

161
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,722
   all targets are engineered   
   to remain stable in flight   

162
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,391
         while following        
    the intended trajectory.    

163
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,128
and, finally, shatter when shot.

164
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:16,675
                     ♪          

165
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,144
narrator: the average cow weighs
       up to 2,000 pounds.      

166
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,148
   during medical procedures,   
        due to its size,        

167
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,816
         a device called        
        the squeeze chute       

168
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,419
  is used to hold a cow steady. 

169
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,422
     the walls of this stall    
     immobilize the animal,     

170
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,092
 allowing a veterinarian access 
    to administer treatment.    

171
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,899
 a squeeze chute holds an animal
        still for medical       

172
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,502
      and other procedures      
    so that no one gets hurt.   

173
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,704
      the key to the design     
         is a front gate        

174
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,240
           that closes          
    around the animal's head    

175
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,710
    and a cage-like structure   
       with a squeeze wall      

176
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,846
     that contains the rest     
          of the body.          

177
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,182
     production starts with     
      a big coil of steel.      

178
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,320
     as it unwinds, rollers     
      straighten the steel      

179
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,989
          and the blade         
      cuts it into sheets.      

180
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,925
         the sheets move        
   to a laser-cutting station.  

181
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:10,194
   the laser cuts out the same  
      part multiple times,      

182
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,997
      producing many parts      
         from one sheet.        

183
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,732
    the part that's produced    

184
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,870
        is a component of       
       the side exit gate.      

185
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,606
the steel is formed into tubing.

186
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,143
  an operator loads the tubing  
     into a bending machine.    

187
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,013
  the machine wraps the tubing  
          around dies,          

188
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:31,149
         shaping it into        
one of the chute's access hoops.

189
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,253
    the machine cuts the ends   
   of the hoop and ejects it.   

190
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,025
       an automated system      
 transfers the hoops to a rack. 

191
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,495
 a technician arranges the hoops

192
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,899
    on the upper half of one    
   of the chute's side frames.  

193
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:52,503
  the jig serves as a template  
 for the placement of the hoops.

194
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,775
   the bottom of the hoops are  
 welded to hinges on the frame. 

195
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,245
   these clips are for opening  
      or locking the hoops.     

196
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,917
     he welds one to the top    
      of each access hoop.      

197
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,856
     the operator can reach     
        through the hoops       

198
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,458
  to gain access to the animal. 

199
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,796
  the hoops can also be opened  
           if needed.           

200
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,931
       another technician       
        assembles a panel       

201
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,268
          to the bottom         
    of the second side frame.   

202
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,872
    he welds clips to the top   
   so the panel can be opened   

203
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,508
           for access           
to the lower part of the animal.

204
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,947
       he hinges the panel      
    to the base of the frame.   

205
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,751
next, an operator uses a machine
      to bend steel tubing      

206
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,621
    against a circular form.    

207
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,155
      after the first bend,     

208
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,292
    the operator repositions    
    the tubing so the machine   

209
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:52,097
    can make the second bend    
   in the specified location.   

210
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,833
       the tailgate frame       
        has taken shape.        

211
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,636
    with the frame and a jig,   
      a technician installs     

212
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:00,772
          vertical bars         
      and diagonal linkages     

213
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,642
    and welds a metal shield    
       to the lower half.       

214
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:07,245
this part keeps the cow's hooves
         safely inside.         

215
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,113
        meanwhile, holes        
        have been drilled       

216
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,516
in both ends of the chute floor.

217
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,852
     they'll be used to move    
         one wall inward        

218
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,621
 to tightly contain the animal. 

219
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,724
    then the chute's skeleton   
         is constructed.        

220
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,059
         using a hoist,         

221
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:26,131
     a technician transfers     
 the tailgate to the structure. 

222
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,999
  the technician guides the top 

223
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:33,538
     on to the squeeze chute    
            framework           

224
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,807
            and welds           
     the structure together.    

225
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,247
  next, he attaches the squeeze 
     wall to the structure.     

226
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,488
  he opens the tailgate to test 
   the clearance and assembles  

227
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,359
   a steel panel to the lower   
    half of the squeeze wall.   

228
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,095
 he mounts the other side panel 
       with the exit gate       

229
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,730
        to the structure.       

230
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,903
      he places hinges into     
  the tailgate frame and welds  

231
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,506
            the panel           
    to the frame at the top.    

232
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,910
     to verify the side gate    
     is operating smoothly,     

233
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,780
 the technician pulls the lever.

234
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,016
   then he opens the tail gate  
     to check its clearance.    

235
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:24,388
    he moves the squeeze side   
      to various settings,      

236
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,126
  making adjustments if needed  
 to ensure that the squeeze wall

237
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:32,930
       is properly aligned      
         at each notch.         

238
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,334
   next, the entire structure   
    is dipped in a paint vat,   

239
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,938
     providing the structure    
       with even coverage.      

240
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,274
     the head gate has been     
      especially contoured      

241
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:46,143
      to hold the animal's      
        head in position.       

242
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,013
      then a worker slides      
         rubber grippers        

243
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:51,616

            narrator:           
   until nearly 30 years ago,   

248
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,645
  boat propellers were normally 
   made of steel or aluminum.   

249
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,114
  today, developers have since  
        tested the waters       

250
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,916
   with composite propellers.   

251
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,385
      made from nylon resin     
         and fiberglass,        

252
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,321
    composite propellers are    
 light weight and don't corrode.

253
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,125
 and, in certain models, broken 
  blades can even be replaced.  

254
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,196
      composite propellers      
         provide boaters        

255
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,665
        with another way        
      to move on the water.     

256
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,336
 these props are the latest way 
  to convert rotational motion  

257
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,271
          into thrust.          

258
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,008
     production starts with     
       a computer design.       

259
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,010
         this one is for        
     a houseboat propeller.     

260
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,746
      the design will drive     
          the machinery         

261
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,882
  that manufactures the molds.  

262
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:02,220
        pellets that are        
   half fiberglass, half resin  

263
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,190
      are placed in a dryer     
       to remove moisture.      

264
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,698
   an operator takes a sample   
      of the dried pellets.     

265
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,834
  first, he weighs the pellets. 

266
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:19,771
 then he heats them to evaporate
    any additional moisture.    

267
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,240
 the change in weight indicates 
        how much moisture       

268
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,808
        has been removed.       

269
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,713
   these two-part metal molds   
        form the pellets        

270
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,448
     into propeller blades.     

271
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:37,055
this process takes just a minute
     and a half to complete.    

272
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,859
  a technician starts a molding 
 machine that melts the pellets.

273
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:44,929
  a large feed screw forces the 
 molten material into the mold. 

274
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,265
     the composite material     
           solidifies,          

275
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,602
  and the operator removes the  
  newly formed propeller blade. 

276
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,472
   the process leaves a piece   
      of unwanted material      

277
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,874
       known as the sprue.      

278
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,809
 the sprue is composite material

279
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,946
   that hardened as it flowed   
         into the mold.         

280
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,281
  once cut, it falls into a bin 

281
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,352
       to be recycled into      
  the next composite propeller. 

282
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:14,359
    the trim propeller is now   
       a functional part.       

283
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:18,430
   next, composite material is  
 molded around an aluminum core 

284
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,131
       to create the hub.       

285
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,238
 a band saw cuts an extruded bar
      of aluminum to size.      

286
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,674
      each piece will serve     
          as one core.          

287
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,380
        using a tool with       
      a sharp-curved blade,     

288
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:39,651
 the technician trims the rough 
  bits left behind by the saw.  

289
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,086
   these rough bits are known   
            as burrs,           

290
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,990
         so this process        
     is known as deburring.     

291
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,462
   once the edges are smooth,   

292
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,998
  the technician attaches clips 
       to the three wings.      

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,870
   these clips will be used to  
  center the core in the mold.  

294
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,006
 the technician slides the core 
         into the mold.         

295
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,809
        the clips hold it       
     in a precise position.     

296
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,877
 then the machine is activated. 

297
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,214
    the machine allows molten   
  fiberglass and resin material 

298
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:14,686
to flow into the mold cavity and
 encapsulate the aluminum core. 

299
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,220
     it also forms channels     

300
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,823
        for the insertion

   moves the hub into position  
          for trimming.         

303
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,971
  a drill cuts into the center
