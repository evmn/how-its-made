00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,025
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,060
horseshoes...         

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,832
...dishwashers...       

4
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,772
...graphite fly rods...    

5
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,479
...and frozen pizzas.     

6
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,055
horses first wore leather and metal shoes around 500 a.d.

7
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,791
to protect their hooves from wear and tear.      

8
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,461
today, depending on the animal's vocation,   

9
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,065
horseshoes are usually made of steel, aluminum, or plastic.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,867
a farrier is someone who makes the horseshoes    

11
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,003
and carefully applies them.  

12
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,742
a horse's hoof has a hard outer wall     

13
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,345
like a fingernail, only much thicker.       

14
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,415
the farrier attaches the horseshoe to this wall   

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,217
with heat and lead nails.   

16
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,751
the horse feels no pain    

17
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,489
because the nails don't reach the sensitive tissues inside. 

18
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,492
horses get new shoes about every five weeks.    

19
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,294
after removing the old ones,  

20
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,962
the farrier uses a file to trim the wall's growth   

21
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,398
since the last change -- about 1/3 of an inch.     

22
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,968
he measures the hoof's contour,

23
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:44,970
marks the measurement on a steel bar,        

24
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,973
and cuts it to size with a rotary saw.       

25
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,443
steel is the material of choice

26
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,446
because it's affordable and durable.          

27
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,450
next, he heats the bar until the middle's white-hot. 

28
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,452
he brushes off any dirt,    

29
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,255
then dips the bar in water to cool it.          

30
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:04,856
then he hammers the ends    

31
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,592
to redistribute the metal toward the middle.       

32
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,794
this widens and thickens the part of the horseshoe   

33
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,196
that gets the most wear,    

34
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,700
since the front of the hoof hits
the ground first and hardest. 

35
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,805
after reheating the bar,    

36
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,276
he hammers it again, this time with no cooldown.  

37
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:26,812
for larger shoes,       

38
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,814
two farriers take turns hammering      

39
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,817
so that it goes faster, and they can shape the steel  

40
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,119
while it's still hot and pliable.        

41
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,357
using a drafting compass,   

42
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,759
the farrier gauges where two grooves for nails will go. 

43
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,028
he reheats the bar,      

44
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,763
then holds a sharp-ended tool against it, 

45
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,434
while another farrier drives it in with a hammer.  

46
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,038
the nails won't protrude when 
they're embedded in the grooves.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,975
these areas will also fill with
dirt to give the horse traction.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,379
the farriers round       
the sharp edges of the horseshoe

49
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,915
so the animal won't cut itself when it's lying down.     

50
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,918
they make the nail holes    

51
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,787
by first driving this tool into the grooves.       

52
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,524
then they use another tool to perforate the steel,    

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,327
hammering it into the shoe over an opening in the anvil  

54
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,529
that lets the tool pierce through.        

55
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,066
the farrier then repeats these steps on the other side. 

56
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,468
it takes 2 farriers about 15 minutes        

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,270
to make a pair of horseshoes. 

58
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,672
the first farrier heats one shoe,        

59
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,807
while the second hammers the other.       

60
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,009
like the hooves,        

61
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,545
the front and back shoes are differently shaped.    

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,748
the front pair are rounder, the back ones, more oval,   

63
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,017
because the horse's hind hooves have evolved    

64
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,086
to dig into the ground for traction.         

65
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,493
the farriers also hammer part of both curves,      

66
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,763
flattening the edges into raised sides called clips.

67
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,099
these help the shoe fit onto the hoof.         

68
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,635
for larger workhorses like clydesdales,       

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,037
the farriers bend the ends downward     

70
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,306
to give the feet more traction.

71
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,509
it's not uncommon for a 2,000-pound horse    

72
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,112
to have to pull twice its weight.       

73
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,980
now time for the fitting.   

74
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,651
after heating the shoe, but not as much this time,   

75
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,587
the farrier uses it to melt the outer part of the wall.  

76
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,123
this makes an imprint on the horseshoe        

77
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,393
that later helps him place it properly on the hoof.     

78
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,529
horses first wear shoes at about 3 years old,     

79
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,399
the age when they start working
or competing.         

80
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,600
the farrier fine-tunes the fitting          

81
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,671
with a metal filing tool, curving the edges further   

82
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,807
to make them even safer for the horse.         

83
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,344
next, he shines the steel with a metal brush.      

84
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,215
the shine will quickly fade once
the horse takes its first steps.

85
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,883
depending on the foot size,  

86
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,219
the finished shoe can measure anywhere      

87
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,356
from 2.5 to 9 inches across.  

88
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,560
now, to attach the shoe,    
the farrier first files the hoof

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,096
to remove any dust or sharp edges.        

90
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,564
he slips on the shoe,     

91
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,869
then gently hammers as many as three nails into each side. 

92
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,242
the nails are about 2 inches long.    

93
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,511
they're made of lead -- a metal that's easy to bend -- 

94
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,048
and that's he'll do after   
hammering them through the wall.

95
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,652
he clips off the ends and bends
the rest in towards the wall. 

96
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,621
then he uses other tools to gouge small crevices    

97
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,323
in which to bury the ends.   

98
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,126
this makes it easy to straighten out the nails  

99
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,528
and yank off the shoe when it's time.        

100
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,331
he also hammers the hoof against a template       

101
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,467
to stabilize the shoe.     

102
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,870
next, he files the hoof so that
it meets the angle of the shoe.

103
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,873
and, finally, the horse is ready to stroll. 

104
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,876
so whether you've got a pony or a stallion,     

105
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,478
make sure the shoe fits.    

106
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,149
when it comes to horse footwear,
function, not fashion, dictates.

107
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,091
narrator: in 1886, an american woman   

108
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,160
invented the automatic dishwasher.   

109
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,496
josephine cochran built a motorized wheel       

110
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,631
with wire compartments for dishes,          

111
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,835
turning inside a copper tank  
filled with soapy boiling water.

112
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,237
it was a hit with restaurants and hotels,  

113
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,440
but it wasn't until the 1950s that affordable dishwashers  

114
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,642
for home kitchens came on the market.      

115
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,519
building a dishwasher     

116
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,455
starts with a watertight container called the tub.   

117
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,058
some high-end models have stainless-steel tubs.   

118
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,593
the rest have tubs made of molded plastic,    

119
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,396
usually polypropylene.     

120
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,001
workers screw two pairs of plastic wheels       

121
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,402
to each side of the tub.    

122
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,205
they'll support the sliders on 
which the upper dish rack moves.

123
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:52,277
the lower dish rack rolls along the bottom of the tub.  

124
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,080
this steel frame helps solidify the tub.    

125
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,419
they affix a steel plate at the bottom         

126
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,955
to shield the plastic from heat of the motor.    

127
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,324
then they attach steel legs to the frame.         

128
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,298
here, they install a rubber reservoir called the sump.   

129
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,202
it collects the water that flows
to the bottom of the tub.   

130
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,577
they screw in a two-part ring to hold the sump in place.   

131
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,880
the heating element is a ceramic-insulated iron cable.

132
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:34,519
this filter traps food particles
washing off the dishes.    

133
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,790
after fitting an o-ring seal to make the sump leakproof,  

134
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,392
they secure the heating element

135
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:45,196
by screwing ceramic insulators to the protruding connectors. 

136
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:49,534
now for the polypropylene wash arms.           

137
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,336
this model has one at the bottom,         

138
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,606
with a tower that juts out for a larger spray span,    

139
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,808
and a second wash arm at the top.          

140
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,483
the motor pumps clean water directly to the bottom wash arm

141
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,053
and, through this flexible hose,
to the top wash arm.      

142
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,023
once they connect the hose,  

143
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,927
they spin the wash arm to make sure there's no obstruction.  

144
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,967
meanwhile, workers connect key components 

145
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,637
to the dishwasher's circuit board.         

146
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,705
this metal box is the timer.  

147
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,107
it controls the wash and dry cycles.    

148
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,111
for example, it activates this green cam lever      

149
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,981
to trigger the white lever to open the detergent dispenser

150
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,416
at the right moment in the wash cycle.       

151
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,924
the detergent dispenser is located on a plastic panel 

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,127
that will line the dishwasher's door.     

153
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,863
they call this panel the inner door.        

154
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,669
this seal will prevent water from leaking out        

155
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,405
and also provide some soundproofing.      

156
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,008
a press runs over the inner door,        

157
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,577
driving in the seal evenly all around.       

158
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,016
now they screw the inner door to the outer door.       

159
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:26,097
the assembled door hooks onto hinges at the base of the tub. 

160
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,703
this machine presses the hook and hinge together  

161
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,105
so that the door doesn't come unhinged.     

162
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,582
the dishwasher's motor is relatively quiet      

163
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,784
because it uses        

164
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,986
an inherently low-noise induction drive design.    

165
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,790
the white machine attached   
to the motor is a food disposer.

166
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:57,862
it grinds up food particles so that they don't clog the drain.

167
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,433
the last technical step    
is to connect the various wires.

168
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,274
before applying the finishing touches,     

169
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,410
workers conduct a seal test.  

170
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:16,014
they flush each tub with water to check for leaks.      

171
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,149
in this portable dishwasher,  

172
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,686
workers install cement blocks as a counterweight       

173
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,089
so that the washer won't tip forward when you open the door.

174
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,892
and because a portable usually sits in full view,   

175
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,761
it also needs sides and a top. 

176
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,899
the top is decorative laminate on medium-density fiberboard. 

177
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,901
they screw it to what's called the wrapper, 

178
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,970
a three-sided panel made of painted steel     

179
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,173
that covers the sides and back --     

180
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,477
a clean look to go with your clean dishes.    

181
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,398
narrator: fishing may not be rocket science,   

182
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,667
but the graphite fly rod certainly is.         

183
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,901
graphite is a space-age material --   

184
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,937
lightweight, flexible, and strong.     

185
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,740
the very qualities that make it useful in space  

186
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,142
also come in handy at the river or lake.     

187
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,145
it explains why graphite fly rods     

188
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,614
are now popular in the fishing world.     

189
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,388
to make one, they start with a sheet of graphite.   

190
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,759
they cut out shapes, following precise measurements.

191
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,027
one mistake here,       

192
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,030
and the performance of the rod will be compromised.      

193
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,170
this will be a three-piece rod,

194
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,540
with a butt piece, midsection, and tip.      

195
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:55,646
they place a shape on a tapered steel mandrel... 

196
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,249
and peel away the paper backing.

197
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,195
this machine rolls the graphite
shape around the mandrel.   

198
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:17,035
they make all three sections  
of the fishing rod the same way.

199
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,908
a graphite strip at the end reinforces it all. 

200
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,813
the graphite remains on the mandrel for the next step. 

201
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,749
they wind polypropylene tape around the graphite      

202
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,953
to squeeze out any air pockets between the layers.      

203
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,362
then it's into the oven to cook
at 257 degrees fahrenheit   

204
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,963
for an hour and a half.    

205
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,300
the tape won't melt,      
but resins in the graphite will,

206
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,669
baking the rolled layers together.           

207
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,979
afterwards, they remove the shrink tape  

208
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,348
and pull the graphite blank off the steel mandrel.     

209
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,522
then the rod blanks go for a dip in a special finish, 

210
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,358
which turns it a deep blue.  

211
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,264
they bake on the finish    

212
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,468
for a half-hour at 257 degrees fahrenheit.   

213
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,675
afterwards, they measure the rod sections 

214
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,380
and cut them to size so they all fit together.   

215
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,454
bending without snapping is  
the graphite rod's strong point.

216
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,526
they hot-glue the stainless-steel tip to the end.

217
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,272
then they piece together the retainer for the fishing reel. 

218
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,447
this locknut will allow the reel
to be tightened.        

219
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,894
the plug will keep everything from sliding off.       

220
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,934
they glue cork rings together to make a handle.       

221
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,037
then they shape it with a chisel and sandpaper.  

222
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,345
the line guides go on next.  

223
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,414
they keep things from getting into a tangle.         

224
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,352
they wind thread around it   

225
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,522
to secure it to the rod, one foot at a time.      

226
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,168
a final step ensures the handiwork doesn't unravel. 

227
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,237
they place the rod in a rotating jig       

228
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,641
and brush three coats of glossy
epoxy onto the thread wrap.  

229
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:14,012
this not only protects it but gives it a nice finish.  

230
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,521
now they slide a metal foot into
a groove on the reel retainer, 

231
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,325
and it's ready for the reel to be attached.        

232
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,260
but before you can cast your line,    

233
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,798
there is some information that needs to go on the rod,  

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,467
like the brand name and serial number.       

235
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,808
a final inspection, and it's almost time to test the waters.

236
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,947
the reel snaps into place,   

237
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,816
and it's easily adjusted with the locknut.       

238
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,889
the rest is a matter of luck and the right bait.      

239
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,169
narrator: millions of pizzas travel daily

240
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,905
from the frozen-food section of the supermarket       

241
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,573
to the family dinner table.  

242
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,643
thick or thin crust, meat or vegetarian,      

243
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,380
their convenience makes them a staple in the freezer.    

244
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,982
but how do they end up tasting so fresh        

245
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,318
when they start out so frozen? 

246
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,996
making frozen pizzas requires a maze of machines.  

247
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,265
to make the dough for the crust,

248
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:46,070
they combine flour, salt, sugar,
water, yeast, and oil     

249
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,873
in a large mixer...      

250
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,476
and they throw in a bit of cornmeal for flavor. 

251
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,080
the mixer turns the ingredients
for about four minutes.    

252
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,349
this is one powerful machine. 

253
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,953
a truck transmission drives the
steel bars that knead the dough.

254
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,559
the dough rises for about half an hour.    

255
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,430
then they feed it into a chunking machine,    

256
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,800
which divides the big blob into smaller pieces.      

257
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,772
the chunks travel to a sheeting machine     

258
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,443
that rolls them into a flat sheet one-inch thick.  

259
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,177
a light dusting of flour    

260
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,914
keeps the dough from sticking to the machinery.

261
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,183
a series of rollers called quick reducers     

262
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,887
gives the dough an even consistency.      

263
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,258
a flour brush massages the dough,      

264
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,594
ensuring a smooth surface.   

265
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,864
next, stainless-steel spikes pierce the dough        

266
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,534
with holes about a quarter-inch deep.   

267
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,669
these holes will stop air pockets     

268
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,873
from forming in the dough.   

269
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,544
a large plastic roller with several round forms    

270
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,780
cuts the circular shape of the pizza crust.      

271
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:18,162
the machine automatically separates the leftover dough. 

272
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,833
the factory remixes it with fresh dough for the next batch.

273
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,239
a conveyor takes the dough circles    

274
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,675
to their next destination -- the oven.           

275
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,846
they bake for two minutes   

276
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,317
between 390 and 600 degrees fahrenheit.          

277
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,587
six chambers inside the oven  

278
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,322
automatically control the temperature pattern    

279
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,692
to ensure that each one bakes evenly.         

280
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,731
next stop -- the tomato sauce. 

281
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:02,206
a tank pumps a steady supply of sauce into a reservoir,   

282
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,976
drenching a roller turning inside.        

283
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:10,014
a plastic board then scrapes the sauce     

284
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,683
onto the crusts passing below. 

285
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:17,488
the excess sauce drips down, replenishing the reservoir.  

286
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:26,597
mounds of preshedded mozzarella
are ready to be added.     

287
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,169
a cheese-applicator machine controls the output      

288
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,540
so that the mozzarella forms an even layer.      

289
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,353
large hoppers load heaps of pepperoni, sausage,     

290
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,323
and other meat toppings into a meat applicator.    

291
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,725
as with the tomato sauce and cheese,          

292
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,596
the meat toppings cascade down on the pizza crusts.      

293
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,536
the pizza is now ready for inspection.        

294
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,205
workers take samples off the line          

295
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,741
and weigh the crust, sauce, cheese, and meat to ensure   

296
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,477
the equipment dispensed the right amount of each.   

297
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,750
next, the pizzas enter a spiral
freezer called a blast cell,  

298
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,619
where they spend about 20 minutes        

299
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,388
at minus-25 degrees fahrenheit.

300
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,626
an overwrapping machine    

301
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,895
applies a clear layer of plastic
around each pizza,       

302
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,299
automatically cutting the wrap to fit.            

303
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,669
a vision-control system takes a picture of every pizza,

304
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,038
verifying the size, diameter, 

305
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,773
and checking for any imperfections.     

306
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,576
the machine automatically rejects     

307
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,377
any less-than-perfect pizzas  

308
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,248
by air-blasting them into a separate tub.      

309
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,954
finally, an arm pushes each pizza into a waiting box. 

310
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:05,929
all that's left now is to heat it up and dig in.  

311
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,933
