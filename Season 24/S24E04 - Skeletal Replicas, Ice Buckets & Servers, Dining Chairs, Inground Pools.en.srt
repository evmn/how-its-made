00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,985
narrator: skeletal replicas  
are excellent educational tools.

4
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,587
while real bones are fragile, 

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,257
these reproductions are made of a synthetic resin, 

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,292
which is very tough.      

7
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,396
these models are scientifically accurate  

8
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,598
and can withstand repeated handling       

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,801
in classrooms or museums.   

10
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,976
this facility is dedicated to producing skeletal replicas... 

11
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:23,482
...everything from ancient humans to prehistoric animals. 

12
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,284
cast from real skeletons, these models          

13
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,288
are virtually indistinguishable
from the original.       

14
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,164
the process starts with a real skull.       

15
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,534
this one is          
of a prehistoric sabertooth cat.

16
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,835
using a wire cutter,      

17
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,104
a worker slices up blocks of clay,        

18
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,174
placing the pieces on the skull.

19
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:52,478
he presses the clay evenly around the skull.    

20
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,318
he soaks a sponge and uses it to moisten and smooth the clay.

21
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,794
he inserts a plastic tube that will come in handy later. 

22
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,798
now, he saturates strips of fiberglass      

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,936
with a polyester resin     
and drapes them around the clay.

24
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,743
left overnight, the fiberglass and resin cure 

25
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,812
into a rigid shell around the clay.        

26
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,213
he repeats this process    

27
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,950
to create a second, identical fiberglass shell.  

28
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,486
with the skull and clay in the bottom half,      

29
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,355
he bolts the second shell on top.            

30
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,492
he pours silicone into the plastic tube,     

31
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,693
filling the space       

32
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,363
between the skull and the top fiberglass shell. 

33
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,101
after repeating this process on the other side,       

34
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,570
he opens the shell.      

35
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,038
he removes the skull      

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,008
and examines the two-part silicone mold.  

37
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,849
he places the two-part mold back into the fiberglass shell 

38
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,652
and straps it to a spinner.  

39
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,520
he pours polyurethane resin into the mold.         

40
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:14,660
at just over a pound, the weight
matches the original skull.  

41
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:19,664
the spinner spirals at a controlled speed,     

42
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,468
evenly distributing the resin throughout the mold.      

43
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:28,540
after the resin has solidified,

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,910
he removes a replica skull from the mold.         

45
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,349
the specially formulated resin 

46
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,719
has the look and texture of bone.            

47
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:47,825
the craftsman scrapes away the ragged bits.        

48
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,830
this part is the jaw.     

49
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,165
using a special grinding tool, 

50
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,903
he cleans up the surface and does a bit of contour work.

51
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,108
with a sharper tool,      

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,044
he better defines the area around the teeth.   

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:15,921
then he grinds the rough bits away from the cheekbone.    

54
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,224
this is the jaw before and after
the improvements.       

55
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,996
now it's over to the paint department,    

56
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,666
where a worker airbrushes the skull using acrylic paint. 

57
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,202
he layers shades of brown, black, and red

58
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,106
to make this replica look more authentic.      

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,688
he inserts the saber teeth in the upper part of the skull 

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,858
and drills little holes in both of them.        

61
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,295
he pushes nails into the holes 

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,931
to secure the teeth in the sockets.        

63
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,170
an inspector now scrutinizes the skull   

64
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,573
and compares it        
to the original one on the left.

65
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,646
just like the real sabertooth cat skull,     

66
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,015
it looks ancient.       

67
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,988
it's difficult to tell the difference     

68
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,825
between the 12,000-year-old skull and the new one.     

69
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,463
the skull is now ready     

70
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,533
for the rest of the skeleton body.     

71
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,607
it takes five people three weeks

72
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,510
to build a skeletal replica like this one.         

73
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,356
narrator: the roman emperor nero     

74
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,491
is believed to have been the first     

75
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,794
to chill wine in containers of ice.     

76
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,297
despite the convenience of modern refrigerators,    

77
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,967
ice buckets and servers are still used today.     

78
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,302
they add presentation value to any occasion,        

79
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,573
whether the host is      
on a champagne or a beer budget.

80
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,246
this ice server's simple design
drains melted ice,       

81
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,849
so food stays cold without getting wet.      

82
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,323
an automatic guillotine blade 

83
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,527
chops large sheets of high-grade stainless steel 

84
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,794
into rectangles.        

85
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,932
a worker takes each rectangle to a punch press.       

86
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,969
the press cuts a pattern of holes into the steel.    

87
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,542
the pattern is geometric    

88
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:55,213
and will drain melting ice efficiently.          

89
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,083
next, it's over to a deep-drawing press.    

90
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,619
it uses 110 tons of force   

91
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,655
to transform the rectangle into a pie-style plate.    

92
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,798
a punch cutter removes the excess steel from the rim. 

93
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,702
the worker now has a perforated ice tray.     

94
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,106
he transfers it to another punch press,    

95
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,209
which cuts finger holes for lifting it from the base. 

96
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,716
the next worker places a larger steel rectangle    

97
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,385
into a different press.    

98
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,555
this will shape the bowl the ice tray rests in.

99
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,128
he returns to the tray and buffs
the rim to a mirror finish.  

100
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,399
after polishing the outside of the bowl to a high gloss,  

101
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,001
he welds two screws to the bottom.         

102
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,015
with the screws firmly in place,

103
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,685
he connects the two steel legs to the bowl.

104
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,560
he attaches a steel platform to the other end of the legs. 

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:25,103
this ice server is complete and ready to chill.      

106
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,238
but before they uncork the champagne,   

107
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,207
they need an ice bucket.    

108
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,346
the bucket starts with a pre-cut steel disk.   

109
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:42,987
an employee places the disk in a more powerful press.   

110
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,391
it uses 165 tons of force   

111
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,595
to transform the disk into a basic bucket shape.   

112
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:55,000
next, another press applies over 175 tons of force 

113
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:58,103
to deepen the bucket and reduce the diameter.    

114
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:07,412
stretching the flat disk twice has made the metal fragile,  

115
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,547
so it's exposed to induction coils       

116
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,350
that are heated to over 1,800 degrees.     

117
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,425
after cooling,         

118
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,427
the steel's strength is restored,          

119
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,896
and it's ready to be shaped again.      

120
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,166
the final press gives the ice bucket      

121
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,768
a cone-like shape.       

122
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,175
the ice bucket spins on a table

123
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,446
that moves through six different
polishing stations.      

124
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,249
the brushes at each stop are progressively thinner,   

125
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,717
and this gradual polishing   

126
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,021
gives the stainless steel bucket
a high sheen.         

127
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,127
with the help of a template,  

128
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,164
the worker welds handles to the steel bucket.      

129
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,540
then the bucket is set upside-down       

130
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,143
on a revolving table.     

131
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:16,014
a pressurized sprayer shoots fine mineral particles 

132
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,783
to give the interior a smooth finish.        

133
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,889
this is the result.      

134
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,693
a filler head now dispenses acid
and then plunges into it    

135
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:32,163
and applies an electrical current.     

136
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,867
this removes the surface metal, 
resulting in a brilliant finish.

137
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,373
after the acid has washed off, 

138
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,443
a worker inserts a perforated plate for drainage.      

139
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,651
this ice bucket is now ready for a party.   

140
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,861
narrator: it's not enough   

141
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,730
for a dining chair to look inviting.        

142
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,467
it also has to be comfortable and sturdy.    

143
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,336
the secret to manufacturing a quality dining chair     

144
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,604
is to use hardwood       

145
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,708
and traditional furniture construction techniques.    

146
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,150
this company makes dining chairs
out of hardwoods,       

147
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,087
such as birch, walnut, oak, and ash.            

148
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,558
they dry the wood until its moisture content is 7%,  

149
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,831
so the chair size stays consistent after construction. 

150
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,100
first, workers stand planks of wood      

151
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,769
on a conveyor belt to apply glue.         

152
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,639
then they align the planks' glued edges...   

153
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:54,045
...and clamp them tightly together in a heated press.  

154
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,185
after a few hours of heat and pressure,     

155
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,122
the glue is dry, and they release the press.  

156
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,126
the planks now form a large panel         

157
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,128
from which to cut the chair parts.        

158
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:18,670
a computer-guided band saw cuts the preliminary shape.  

159
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,773
these are chair legs.     

160
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,952
the next machine, the profiler,
finalizes the shape      

161
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,154
and sands the wood surface on all sides.         

162
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,959
workers now mount the parts on 
another computer-guided machine.

163
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,573
this one drills slots called mortises. 

164
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,710
these mortises will receive pins called tenons

165
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,846
protruding from adjoining parts.

166
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,251
before assembly, workers sand all the parts   

167
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,019
so they can be stained later. 

168
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,862
to make a curved chair back, they have to bend the wood.   

169
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:23,334
they need the wood to have a 15% to 22% moisture content. 

170
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:28,273
any drier, and the fibers would snap when bent.     

171
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,274
they steam the wood for an hour

172
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,844
to soften it and make it more flexible.   

173
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,756
they place the steamed wood in a curved mold on a press.  

174
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,690
then they dry it with a device 

175
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,627
that generates heat using radio frequencies.    

176
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,431
after about an hour,      

177
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,369
they release the press and remove the wood.      

178
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:03,107
the moisture content is now 7%, 
which maintains the curve shape.

179
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:11,048
parts that need tenons go into this automated machine.

180
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,353
its rotary knife shapes the tenon in about one second. 

181
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,593
workers glue the mortises   

182
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,996
in the two vertical sides of the chair back,       

183
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,865
then brush glue onto the tenons

184
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,267
of the chair back's horizontal pieces.       

185
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,071
they align the tenons and the mortises  

186
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,607
and secure them in place with a mallet.         

187
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,949
they put the chair back into a press          

188
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,418
to force the tenons in place. 

189
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,555
they reinforce each mortise-and-tenon joint  

190
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,025
with staples designed for wood.

191
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,229
they continue to assemble the chair parts  

192
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,899
with mortise and tenon joints. 

193
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,967
this method is key       

194
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,737
to the chair's strength and stability.         

195
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,448
now for the final stage of construction.        

196
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,719
they attach the front-leg assembly to the chair back.  

197
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:29,527
the chair is placed in a press 
to completely secure the tenons.

198
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,732
then they attach a support piece
in each corner.        

199
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,334
in the finishing department,  

200
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,469
they spray a light coat of stain,     

201
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,072
wipe off the excess so that the color is even,   

202
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,075
spray on a sealant, lightly re-sand the wood,   

203
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,577
and apply a coat of protective finish.  

204
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,882
finally, they add a seat cushion,    

205
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,686
which screws into the chair from underneath.        

206
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,854
now you're sitting pretty.   

207
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,635
narrator: the first pools were built   

208
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,471
by the ancient greeks and romans
in the 19th century.      

209
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,775
large cities like london    

210
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,178
started building indoor pools for sports and recreation.   

211
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,883
backyard residential pools became popular in the 1950s.  

212
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,655
today, residential in-ground pools  

213
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,126
are available in a variety of shapes and sizes.      

214
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,396
their parts are made to order in the factory.        

215
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,697
the first step is to design the pool     

216
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,234
according to the client's specifications.  

217
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,870
computer software then determines        

218
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,707
exactly which components must be built.         

219
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,945
the side panels of the pool are made with galvanized steel 

220
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,616
plated with zinc to prevent rusting.      

221
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,086
they die-cut "v"-shaped notches
on the top           

222
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,888
and will cut similar ones on the bottom later.      

223
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,091
these little dimples in the metal          

224
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,094
will hide the heads of bolts. 

225
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,629
they punch out holes      

226
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,698
on the remaining ends of the panel.         

227
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,034
these will serve to join multiple panels    

228
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,404
to create the perimeter of the pool.          

229
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:27,111
they insert each panel in a powerful metal folder.  

230
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,380
it firmly clamps the sheet of metal       

231
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,317
and pushes up the edge to create a 90-degree angle.  

232
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,852
taking a flat, metal sheet   

233
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,321
and turning it into a three-dimensional object

234
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,190
makes it stronger.       

235
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:44,996
they fold the notches at the top
and bottom ends of the panel. 

236
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:49,067
they also die-cut a large hole for the clean-water inlet.   

237
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,806
to make a curved panel, they place it on a fixed-radius jig.

238
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,143
they insert a metal profile called a stiffener       

239
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,280
and bolt it in place.     

240
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,348
they use a custom flat head bolt and nut          

241
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,019
that will lodge themselves in the metal dimples.     

242
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,555
next, an automated clamp    

243
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,826
bends the panel to fit the jig's curve.    

244
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,830
the "v"-shaped notches allow the panel to bend easily,

245
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,501
but workers must install radius
belts to maintain this shape. 

246
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,241
they fasten the radius belts permanently          

247
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,443
using hydraulic rivet guns.  

248
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,581
all in-ground pool panels are made to order       

249
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,851
and shipped as soon as they are ready.   

250
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,856
in the thermoforming department,

251
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,992
they use a fixed sheet of a.b.s. plastic       

252
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,894
to make the in-ground pool steps.   

253
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,264
the sheet is firmly clamped in a frame           

254
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,000
and goes into an oven.     

255
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,268
the oven heats the plastic   

256
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,071
to around 350 degrees for five minutes        

257
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,573
until it gets soft and pliable.

258
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,345
as the plastic comes out of the oven,     

259
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,080
a fiberglass mold is pushed up,

260
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,283
forming the main shape of the steps.         

261
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,220
a rigid cage seals the sides, 

262
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,956
and a powerful vacuum sucks out the air,       

263
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,494
forcing the plastic against the mold.       

264
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,096
a series of fans cool down the plastic.     

265
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:30,234
when it has hardened enough, it's removed from the mold.   

266
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,638
they prepare the vinyl liner for the inside of the pool.   

267
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,175
there are about 30 designs to choose from.        

268
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,644
workers unroll the vinyl on a cutting table,      

269
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,381
where a conveyor will keep pulling on it.    

270
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,783
a computer-controlled rotary knife          

271
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,153
zips over the moving vinyl... 

272
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,026
...cutting effortlessly    

273
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,629
to create all the required sections.   

274
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,334
the cutting process generates little waste,    

275
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,337
and the materials are fully recyclable.     

276
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,144
workers carefully fold each section of the liner.   

277
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,679
all sections will be assembled in another department,     

278
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,216
according to the assembly plan.

279
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,354
on-site, they assemble the steps,    

280
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:28,158
the side panels, and the piping
for the filter and heater.   

281
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,827
they pour concrete around the pool        

282
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,495
to form a foundation.     

283
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,832
then they pour some inside the pool        

284
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,500
to create the bottom.     

285
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:40,404
they smooth the surface and let
the concrete set for two days. 

286
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,576
a worker unfolds the vinyl liner.    

287
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,445
it has a semi-rigid pvc edge  

288
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,947
that hooks into the top of the pool.      

289
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,518
they fill the space around the pool with gravel  

290
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,455
and pour a concrete sidewalk on top.            

291
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,059
all that's left to do is add paving stones or a deck,

292
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,794
some plants and furniture,   

293
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,764
and you'll have your own, personal paradise.       

294
