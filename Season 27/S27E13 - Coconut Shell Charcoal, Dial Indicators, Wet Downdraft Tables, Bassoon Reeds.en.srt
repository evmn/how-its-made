00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,987
narrator: coconut shells used to be considered     

4
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,721
agricultural waste,      

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,659
but today they're processed into biofuel for the barbecue. 

6
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,394
in countries like thailand,  

7
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,930
companies convert the shells into briquettes        

8
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,666
that burn cleanly for an extended period.    

9
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,437
throwing away these shells   
would be a real waste of energy.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,075
instead of ending up as landfill,          

11
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,744
coconut shells are being used to fire the grill.    

12
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,215
processed into briquettes that burn virtually smoke-free,   

13
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:28,286
the shells are now considered a resource instead of garbage. 

14
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,156
converting coconut shells to charcoal starts       

15
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,259
with the partial-combustion process.            

16
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,962
inside these brick igloo-style kilns,       

17
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,697
they create a burning environment     

18
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,899
that allows the shells to be carbonized        

19
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:44,636
but doesn't reduce them to ash.      

20
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,572
the kilns are partially underground.     

21
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,642
the surrounding soil helps to seal the fire.       

22
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:56,448
this keeps the air levels down for a slow, smoldering burn.  

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,586
a worker bricks up the kiln door.         

24
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,055
and he seals these bricks with mud instead of cement.  

25
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,658
this will allow the door to be dismantled later     

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,259
without ruining the bricks,  

27
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,263
preserving them for reuse in the next burn.       

28
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,470
from the top, he ignites the fire using soft      

29
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,472
wax as starter material.    

30
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,547
because of the limited air in the kilns,         

31
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,285
the fire burns out after 20 to 24 hours.     

32
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,488
a worker takes the door apart and rakes the charred remains 

33
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,291
of the coconut shells into a basket.         

34
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:46,898
they have been converted into a rich charcoal.     

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,735
he heaps the blackened shells into a pile.      

36
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,775
and under the intense sun, moisture from water,      

37
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,580
used to extinguish any hot spots, evaporates.   

38
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,384
the charcoal dries out and breaks easily.       

39
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,621
it's now ready to be processed into briquettes.   

40
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,627
workers load the charcoal pieces into grinders.     

41
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,531
this is dirty work.      

42
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,000
so they protect their faces with scarves    

43
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,403
and their hands with gloves.  

44
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,272
inside the grinding machines, 

45
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,808
rollers pulverize the charcoal,

46
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,277
reducing it to a fine powder. 

47
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,281
the powder flows into bins below.        

48
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:41,353
a worker then transfers the charcoal powder to a mixer.

49
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,554
he adds a generous amount of starch made         

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,693
from the root of the cassava tree.      

51
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,161
together with water, the starch will bond      

52
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,233
the charcoal particles together like glue.      

53
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,570
the mixer whisks it all together like pastry.   

54
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,640
the consistency is right when the particles form clumps 

55
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,311
when pressed together.     

56
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:11,316
the moistened blend exits   
the mixer and spills into a bin.

57
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,654
this coconut shell charcoal  

58
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,457
is now ready to be pressed into briquettes.    

59
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:29,067
the next worker loads the charcoal into a press.   

60
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,203
it forces the tacky black powder through a die   

61
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,673
to press it into a perpetual hexagon      

62
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,675
with a hole in the center.   

63
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,948
as the machine extrudes the charcoal,         

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,817
a worker chops it into briquettes       

65
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,253
that are just over 3 inches in length.      

66
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,291
these coconut charcoal briquettes      

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,692
have now taken shape.     

68
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,062
but they're not yet ready for the grill.      

69
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,835
they're soft and mushy     
to the touch and crumble easily.

70
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,708
to firm them up,        

71
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,109
they place them in structures 

72
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,145
with open fires in the center. 

73
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,449
they close the doors      

74
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,983
and leave the briquettes to bake

75
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,987
over a period of about 24 hours.

76
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,260
the heat fuses         
the charcoal particles together.

77
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,530
and the briquettes harden.   

78
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,931
out of the curing chamber,   

79
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,334
this briquette is solid to the touch and clean too.  

80
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,138
it leaves no sooty residue.  

81
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,008
from coconut shells to barbecue briquettes,    

82
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,945
it's been quite a transformation.       

83
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:51,516
this coconut shell charcoal is now ready to sizzle.    

84
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,892
♪♪         

85
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,632
narrator: in many disciplines, you have to take measurements. 

86
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,034
sometimes, those measurements are so minute         

87
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,772
they're difficult or impossible
for the human eye to determine.

88
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,441
so a ruler or tape measure can't help.      

89
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,311
what you need instead is a precision-measuring tool 

90
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,279
called a dial indicator.    

91
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,385
on this dial indicator,    

92
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:31,523
each graduation is 0.001 inches.        

93
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,658
a full revolution of the hand measures      

94
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,795
100 thousandths of an inch.  

95
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,397
to make a key component, called the bridge plate,    

96
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,467
this automated punch press stamps out brass circles,   

97
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,338
which are about 2 inches in diameter.     

98
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,206
workers place each bridge plate

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,741
into a manual punch press,   

100
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,609
which makes location holes   

101
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,478
that will correctly position the bridge plate        

102
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
on the next press.       

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,550
this press makes holes for mounting screws,      

104
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,154
locating pins, as well as for three precision jewels, 

105
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:05,957
which reduce friction on moving metal components.  

106
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,161
this lathe begins the process 
of shaping a stainless steel rod

107
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,964
into the dial indicator's main measuring component,   

108
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,366
called the rack.        

109
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,168
under a shower of cutting oil,        

110
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,971
the machine drills and threads a hole on each end       

111
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,974
for attaching a contact made of plated steel.     

112
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,380
next, this milling machine cuts teeth spaced       

113
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,917
25 thousandths of an inch apart.       

114
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,186
one of the dial indicator's gears runs     

115
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,455
along these rack teeth to turn the hand        

116
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:40,057
that displays the measurement.        

117
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,128
this computer-guided machine forms an aluminum bar     

118
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,529
into another key component,  

119
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,797
called the bridge.       

120
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,800
the bridge has holes for screws

121
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,067
and locating pins       

122
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,136
that align with those in the bridge plate      

123
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,938
so that the two can fasten,  

124
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,275
sandwiching the gears in between.          

125
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,077
the bridge also has holes for three jewels,       

126
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,148
which workers insert with a punch press.      

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,884
jewels are doughnut-shaped synthetic rubies        

128
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,153
set in a brass ring.      

129
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,688
they line the holes for the gears         

130
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,690
and other moving components.  

131
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,558
the jewel's surface is very smooth.        

132
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,362
so it eases friction on the component.       

133
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,298
workers check every jewel under a microscope       

134
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,035
to make sure it didn't crack when pressed into the hole.  

135
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,372
the dial indicator's outside case is made of aluminum,   

136
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,909
shaped by this computer-guided turning and milling machine.  

137
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,980
workers spray the case with powdered paint      

138
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,315
using an electric charge    

139
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,584
to draw the particles onto the surface        

140
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:43,188
in a thorough, even coat.   

141
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,124
then, they bake the case in an oven for 20 minutes   

142
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,593
to make the paint finish ultra durable.     

143
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,864
they put the case on a machine 

144
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,333
that presses in top and bottom steel stems,  

145
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,636
which will hold the rack in place.       

146
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:09,147
they mount a hair spring on the bridge plate.      

147
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,016
this spring allows the gear  

148
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,284
to return to its original position       

149
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,121
after moving the rack upward to take a measurement.     

150
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,760
they insert what's called a pinion        

151
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:25,296
for the large dial hand in the center jeweled hole   

152
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,098
and a second gear into the jeweled hole     

153
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,035

00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,886
the bassoon's full range of 44 notes.    

306
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,021
then, he scores both ends of the cane     

307
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,557
to make them flexible enough  

308
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,725
to be bent into a half circle. 

309
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,697
he folds the cane in half and ties it      

310
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,634
with a piece of brass wire.  

311
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,636
the fold will form the double blades       

312
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,838
at the top of the reed.    

313
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
the opposite ends,       

314
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,041
once bent into mating half circles,         

315
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,211
will form the tube at the bottom.         

316
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:39,583
keeping the cane wet, he heats a cylindrical-forming mandrel 

317
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,086
over the flame of an oil-burning lamp.    

318
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,960
then, he wraps the tube end tightly with twine.    

319
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,199
the heat softens the cane's fibers,       

320
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,202
molding them under pressure from the tightly wound twine  

321
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,938
to the shape of the mandrel.  

322
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,674
this forms the two adjoining half circles     

323
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,544
into a perfectly round tube.  

324
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,811
after a few seconds,      

325
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,880
he removes the forming mandrel 

326
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,816
and unwraps the twine.     

327
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,686
he inserts a holding mandrel of the same diameter      

328
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,623
and wraps it with a rubber band.

329
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,360
he puts the reed aside to dry for about a week.    

330
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,963
this sets the shape permanently.

331
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,765
when he unwraps and unfolds the reed,     

332
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,835
he sands the edges of the two adjoining half circles     

333
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,772
so that they meet perfectly.  

334
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,241
then, he refolds the reed,   

335
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,842
securing it with three wires  

336
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:43,247
spaced at specific intervals. 

337
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,715
the distance between the wires,

338
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,117
in concert with the curved shape of the cane,       

339
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,587
finalizes the contour of the reed,          

340
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:53,390
which determines how it vibrates.        

341
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,793
one the wires are correctly positioned,     

342
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,594
he wraps the tube end of the reed          

343
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,464
with strong synthetic string. 

344
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,132
this will contain the tube dimensions      

345
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,402
when the reed is resoaked.   

346
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,405
he coats the string with glue 

347
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,007
to further strengthen the tube.

348
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,676
once the glue dries,      

349
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,343
he reams the inside of the tube

350
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,113
to fit perfectly into the bassoon's lead pipe.    

351
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,754
he places a ruler against the first wire     

352
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,955
and makes a mark of just    

353
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,960
over an inch out toward the folded tip.     

354
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,562
then, he clips off the folded tip.        

355
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,831
the reed now has double blades 

356
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,767
that vibrate when a musician blows air through them.    

357
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,936
[ bassoon playing ]      

358
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,443
because cane is a plant, not a synthetic material,   

359
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,314
there are slight natural variations from reed to reed. 

360
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:54,986
so bassoonists make the last minor adjustments themselves  

361
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,654
with profilers and other tools 

362
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,691
until their reed vibrates beautifully.
