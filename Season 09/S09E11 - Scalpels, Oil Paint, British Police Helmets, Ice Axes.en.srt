scalpel handles are made from   
rods of stainless steel.        

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,679
scalpel handles are made from   
rods of stainless steel.        
the blades are made of either   

17
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,982
rods of stainless steel.        
the blades are made of either   
carbon steel or stainless steel.

18
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,484
the blades are made of either   
carbon steel or stainless steel.
they're sterile and designed for

00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,685
carbon steel or stainless steel.
they're sterile and designed for
one-time use only.

the blade steel is extremely

it arrives at the scalpel       
factory in coiled strips.

it arrives at the scalpel

the first machine feeds the

the first machine feeds the     
strips into a press.            

26
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,534
the first machine feeds the

a die inside punches out

29
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,438
unfinished blades, called       
blanks.                         
blades will vary in size and    

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,973
blanks.                         
blades will vary in size and    
contour, but they all have the

blades will vary in size and    
contour, but they all have the  
same center slot for attaching

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,113
same center slot for attaching  
the handle.                     
when you flex a blank, it bends 

34
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,714
the handle.                     
when you flex a blank, it bends 
entirely out of shape.          

35
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,482
when you flex a blank, it bends 
entirely out of shape.          
that's because the steel still  

36
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,051
entirely out of shape.          
that's because the steel still  
needs to be tempered.           

37
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,518
that's because the steel still  
needs to be tempered.           
the blanks pass through a

the blanks pass through a       
furnace for about 30 seconds.

the heat alters the molecular   
structure of the metal,         

41
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,026
the heat alters the molecular   
structure of the metal,         
hardening it.

00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,227
structure of the metal,         
hardening it.                   
now the blank has the           

43
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,662
hardening it.                   
now the blank has the           
flexibility a scalpel blade     

44
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,865

a worker threads a metal ring   
through the slots to keep them  
together, then sends the whole

set of blanks for surface       
polishing.                      
this process will restore the

they transfer the blanks from

they transfer the blanks from

if it doesn't spread far enough,
it needs more milling.

the prong ends of the helmet's  
decorative metalwork are dipped

the prong ends of the helmet's  
decorative metalwork are dipped

holes are drilled through the   
markings.

harness and chinstrap.          

308
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:49,620
they fit the harness assembly   
inside the helmet, then secure  
it with an industrial stapler.

not only does this banding hide 
the staples, it gives the helmet

production of an ice axe starts 
with an aluminum rod.

the hot forging transforms the

it starts to look a lot more

metal rod.                      
it starts to look a lot more    
like the shaft of an ice axe.   

358
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:31,049
the long ridges add strength to 
the metal while other

attachments are to go.          

360
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:44,462
the forging creates a lip around
the perimeter of the shaft.     
they call this excess metal

then, it's time to bring all the
pieces of the ice axe together.

then, it's time to bring all the

a worker applies epoxy to the   

398
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,692
pieces of the ice axe together. 
a worker applies epoxy to the   
inside of the rubber handle and 

399
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:29,433
a worker applies epoxy to the   
inside of the rubber handle and 
slides it onto the shaft.       

400
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,335
inside of the rubber handle and 
slides it onto the shaft.       
the handle has an open end.     

401
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,936
slides it onto the shaft.       
the handle has an open end.     
he beads a little more epoxy    

402
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,438
the handle has an open end.     
he beads a little more epoxy    
onto it and inserts a steel     

403
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,844
he beads a little more epoxy    
onto it and inserts a steel     
spike.                          

404
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,712
onto it and inserts a steel     
spike.                          
the spike is then riveted to the

405
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,614
spike.                          
the spike is then riveted to the
ice-axe shaft.                  

406
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,982
the spike is then riveted to the
ice-axe shaft.                  
this spike will come in very    

407
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,651
ice-axe shaft.                  
this spike will come in very    
handy on the mountain side.     

408
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,252
this spike will come in very    
handy on the mountain side.     
plunging it into a snowy slope  

409
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,987
handy on the mountain side.     
plunging it into a snowy slope  
can help a climber maintain his 

410
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,455
plunging it into a snowy slope  
can help a climber maintain his 
or her balance on a slippery    

411
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,357
can help a climber maintain his 
or her balance on a slippery    
uphill trek.                    

412
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:07,204
next, the adz slides into the   
slot at the head of the shaft.  
climbers use this tool to chop  

413
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,040
slot at the head of the shaft.  
climbers use this tool to chop  
steps in hard snow and ice.     

414
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:23,754
the worker secures the adz with 
nuts and bolts, and then he     
installs the pick.              

415
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:24,689
nuts and bolts, and then he     
installs the pick.              
this hooked and jagged          

416
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,023
installs the pick.              
this hooked and jagged          
attachment will help get the    

417
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,225
this hooked and jagged          
attachment will help get the    
climber up a mountain of hard   

418
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,126
attachment will help get the    
climber up a mountain of hard   
ice.                            

419
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,233
the bolts are tightened with a  

420
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,768
torque wrench.                  

421
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,637
after all, a solid job here     

422
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,539
could be a lifesaver.           

423
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,778
and finally, the adjustable     

424
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,247
finger rest is screwed to the   

425
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:54,217
shaft just above the handle.    

426
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,853
and now you have a tool that can

427
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,721
help you scale new heights.
