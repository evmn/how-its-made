went digital,

00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,390
the turntable seemed destined for the scrap heap.      

3
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:01,193
but this analog technology   
defied predictions and survived.

4
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,462
with a sound that's arguably fuller     

5
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,131
and more natural        
than compressed digital formats,

6
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,936
this retro technology is attracting new fans.

00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,676
in an age when media players are digitized and pocket-sized,

the use of high-tech composites
like carbon fiber       

10
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:26,618
puts a modern spin on this technology,

production starts with a thick square of cast acrylic.

14
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,297
the technician drills a hole in the center.         

15
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,898
it will be a reference point  

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,636
as he transforms this square into the turntable platter.   

17
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,372
a computerized tool      

18
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:49,108
cuts a circle shape out of the square.       

19
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,313
the disc then spins while another computer-guided tool  

20
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,582
enlarges the center hole    

21
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,919
to size it for the platter's main bearing.

22
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,189
the next tool precisely cuts the surface of the disc    

23
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,024
to give it the correct angle. 

24
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:12,798
computerized tools transform this small aluminum disc    

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,233
into the counterweight's main component.        

26
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,336
the counterweight balances the tone arm     

27
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,739
to keep the stylus in the groove of an l.p.    

28
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,141
they slope the surface     

29
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:26,044
and cut holes for attachments and for installing the part.  

30
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:31,017
finally, they cut a triangle out of the circle.       

31
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,956
this takes the part      
to its final shape and weight...

from a flat disc        

33
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,194
to a precisely crafted counterweight.         

34
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,034
next, the platform for the tone arm takes shape. 

35
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,235
it's designed to cradle all the parts

at the end of the tone arm,

including a cylindrical housing
for a spring mechanism     

38
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:59,244
and an egg-shaped housing containing a bearing.     

39
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,646
a technician now assembles the tone arm,  

40
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,783
beginning with a tapered tube made of carbon fiber.     

41
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,720
it's a high-tech composite that's extremely stiff,    

42
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:11,524
so there should be no structural
weakness in this crucial part. 

43
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,393
the technician threads a preassembled wiring loom   

44
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:15,994
through the arm tube.     

45
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,331
it's special wire for high-frequency transfer.  

46
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,534
these wires have been encased in copper  

47
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,535
to keep out ambient radiation 

48
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,672
that would interfere with the tone arm's operation. 

49
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,409
the carbon-fiber tube     
also acts as a radiation shield.

50
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,212
he mixes epoxy resin that he then dabs around    

51
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,214
the inner rim of the bearing housing,    

52
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,384
which has by now been equipped with the bearing.       

53
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,090
he inserts the tone arm tube into the housing.       

54
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,630
the tube adheres to the glue-coated rim,    

55
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,899
but before it totally bonds,  

56
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,236
the technician scrutinizes the alignment.         

57
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,238
he makes adjustments if needed,

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,840
and then he'll clamp the assembly          

59
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,342
to allow the glue to cure.

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,180
with the turntable tone arm now upright,          

61
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,049
he solders the wires that are protruding from the joint 

62
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,252
to external wiring for the amplifier.       

63
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,258
and once all the connections have been made,        

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,162
he inserts the wires into the metal joint.     

65
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,398
ensconced in this joint,    

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,667
the connections are well-protected       

67
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,604
and can't be pulled apart.   

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,140
he equips           
the main counterweight component

69
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:39,011
with two thick steel beams for balance.          

70
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,280
he slides the counterweight onto a third beam,       

71
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,350
which has been installed in the egg-shaped housing.   

72
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,720
this completes the turntable tone arm.    

73
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:55,127
next, they encase the electric motor in its metal housing.  

74
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,099
and they build the record deck.

75
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,635
they mount the motor to the two-tiered deck,    

76
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,703
designed to absorb any vibration.         

77
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,372
the aluminum sub-chassis is next.            

78
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,242
they link it to the motor with a drive belt,       

79
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,911
then they give the belt-drive system a test spin       

80
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,647
to confirm that it runs smoothly.     

81
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,517
they now install the acrylic platter,      

82

felt mat, and tone arm.

the record spins,

and the stylus traces the grooves.

narrator: the first modern steam engine 

91
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,490
was invented in england in the early 1700s,      

92
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,892
helping launch the industrial revolution.   

93
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,896
today there's a return to steam power.        

94
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,497
due to its different configuration

00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,966
and combustion process,    

96
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:09,301
a steam engine produces less pollution    

97
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:13,906
than a regular internal-combustion engine.  

98
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,774
this steam engine burns fuel  

99
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,310
in an external combustion chamber.      

100
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,647
the resulting heat turns water into pressurized steam     

101
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,049
that enters the cylinders, pushing pistons,        

102
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,519
turning a crankshaft that powers the drive train.  

103
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,522
because this engine doesn't burn fuel inside the cylinders 

104
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,791
like a traditional car engine, 

105
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,661
it can run on any type or mixture of fuels

the circular engine block is made of aluminum.      

108
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,135
technicians install studs   

109
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:46,338
to hold six stainless-steel cylinders.   

110
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,741
due to the constant exposure to steam,           

111
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:52,677
all engine parts are made of rustproof materials.    

112
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,148
the technicians insert a piston
into each cylinder.      

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,416
the piston is aluminum     

114
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,152
with a heat-resistant carbon cap
and glider           

115
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,888
to isolate it from the cylinder wall.    

116
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,424
they connect the piston rods to the crankshaft in the center

117
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,360
with a specially designed component           

118
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,894
called a spider bearing.    

119
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,098
this bearing is designed to modify the piston stroke,  

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,168
producing a smoother rotation of the crankshaft       

121
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,436
and more power to the engine. 

122
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,040
unlike a traditional car engine,
with cylinders arranged in line,

123
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,709
these cylinders are in a radial configuration 

124
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,446
and therefore equidistant from the center.        

125
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:31,316
this prevents the engine from 
warping under high temperatures.

126
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,452
they place a counterbalance over their spider bearing   

127
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,256
to further smooth the motion of the crankshaft.       

128
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,926
now they install a pushrod over each cylinder.      

129
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,460
it operates a valve,      

130
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,265
which lets steam enter the cylinder and move the piston. 

131
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:51,470
they insert the base of each pushrod into a guide ring...  

132
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,273
then attach the cylinder heads,

133
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,741
each of which houses a steam-entry valve.  

134
00:07:56,743 --> 00:08:00,045
they insert the pushrod into the valve.        

135
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,285
then, to complete the engine assembly,      

136
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,553
they install the cam,     

137
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,423
which pushes the pushrods as the shaft spins.      

138
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,292
the factory hooks up every completed engine     

139
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,695
for a couple of rounds of performance testing.    

140
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,965
first, a trial run using air pressure       

141
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,500
to check for leaks       

142
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,703
and to verify that all components operate correctly. 

143
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,237
if everything's fine,     

144
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,941
then they repeat the process with steam pressure.      

145
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:34,580
this type of steam engine can power many types of machines, 

146
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,982
from cars, trucks, and boats, 

147
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,584
to electric generators as we see here.        

148
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,654
in a vehicle, it doesn't require
a transmission         

149
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,859
because it produces so much rotational power.   

150
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,994
now for the heat exchanger,  

151
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:53,331
the component which turns water
into engine-powering steam.  

152
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,400
technicians use a motorized wheel       

153
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,735
to wind 20 feet of stainless-steel tubing   

154
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,505
into a coil.          

155
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,876
they bind the coil with steel thread,       

156
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,811
putting a stitch in between each tube      

157
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,280
to create a minute gap.    

158
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,550
that way, when fuel burns in the combustion chamber,   

159
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,486
the heat can travel over and in between the tubes, 

160
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,689
heating the water inside faster and more efficiently  

161
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,090
than if the heat would contact 

162
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,361
only the coils' top and bottom surfaces.      

163
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:27,966
the result -- superheated steam
in just five seconds.     

164
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,040
they stack six of these coils, 

165
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,175
one to feed steam to each cylinder.       

166
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,643
this nest of tubes       

167
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,847
form the engine's primary heat exchanger.    

168
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,783
they test it using any number of fuels,   

169
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,854
even waste fuels which would otherwise be discarded,    

170
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,588
such as used motor oil     

171
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,193
and used vegetable oil from restaurant fryers.    

172
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,263
virtually anything that burns will do the job.        

173
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,199
the fuel combusts at low pressure,        

174
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,602
not at high pressure as in a gas or diesel engine. 

175
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,271
that means burning fossil fuels
to make steam         

176
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,007
produces far fewer greenhouse gases,        

177
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,877
and most hydrocarbons burn off completely      

178
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,212
within the sealed combustion chamber.      

179
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,349
you never have to refill or top off the water      

180
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,418
because a condenser cools the steam back into water,   

181
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,821
which then recirculates.    

182
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,156
water is not only the working fluid --      

183
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,960
it also acts as the engine lubricant,    

184
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,596
so the steam engine doesn't require motor oil.   

185
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,566
besides fuel combustion,    

186
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,636
this modern steam engine can run off other heat sources,

187
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,703
such as solar heat       

188
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,840
and exhaust heat from furnaces or engines.   

189
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,124
narrator: there was a time when the playground equipment 

190
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,127
in the local park or schoolyard
was pretty basic stuff --   

191
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,797
a set of swings, a slide, maybe a see-saw or two.    

192
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,199
today's playground equipment  

193
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,134
is far more varied, imaginative, and colorful,   

194
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,871
designed to stimulate children's minds        

195
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,807
as well as exercise their bodies.         

196
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,379
slide down, climb on, wriggle through.        

197
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,548
there's no end to how kids can frolic     

198
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,150
on modular play structures   

199
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,786
or on this bubble-belly dinosaur.           

200
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,759
to make the dinosaur's neck and legs, 

201
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,160
an automated band saw     

202
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,697
cuts long steel tubes to specific lengths.      

203
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,439
the tube for the neck is 5 1/2 feet long.      

204
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,509
workers curve it in a bending press.      

205
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,477
a level helps them get it just right.       

206
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,385
next, they weld on two steel plates.        

207
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:04,923
these will support plastic seats
on which kiddies can sit.   

208
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,658
workers also weld on bars   

209
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,661
for attaching the neck to the body.          

210
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,264
they weld anchoring tabs and supporting bars      

211
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,333
to the four steel-tube legs.  

212
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,003
workers sandblast the legs and neck       

213
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,005
with stainless-steel grit.   

214
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,074
the sandblasting gun shoots the grit        

215
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,076
at a speed of 435 miles an hour.

216
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,814
this roughens the surface,   
enabling paint to better adhere.

217
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,618
after applying an undercoat of gray primer,  

218
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,754
workers spray on a coat of plastic-based paint.    

219
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,059
the paint is then baked on, which maximizes its durability.

220
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,431
meanwhile, a computer-guided engraving machine       

221
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,367
carves an educational design into a panel          

222
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,637
made of triple-layered polyethylene plastic.      

223
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,174
panels like this block the open
sides of playground equipment, 

224
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,977
preventing children from falling through.     

225
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,384
to construct the dinosaur's bubble-shaped body,      

226
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,718
workers bolt together     

227
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,523
two half-spheres made of molded polyethylene plastic.

228
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:15,560
they position the bubble body on the legs...         

229
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,268
...then bolt them together from the inside.        

230
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,937
they bolt the neck to the body.

231
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,472
the neck has since been outfitted    

232
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,942
with plastic seats and the dino's plastic head.  

233
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,810
they finish off the dinosaur  

234
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,214
with a metal label bearing product information.  

235
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,017
this factory produces several components       

236
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,885
for its modular play structures,

237
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,656
such as a climbing net made of galvanized steel cable.

238
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,225
the hard cable is padded in polyurethane.   

239
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,160
workers use hydraulic scissors 

240
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,362
to cut the required lengths of cable...          

241
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,764
then a cable stripper     

242
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,700
to slice off a little more than an inch of polyurethane  

243
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,770
from the ends of certain cables.

244
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,905
workers then cap each exposed end        

245
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,240
with a sleeved aluminum ring. 

246
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,844
they crimp the sleeve with a 44-ton press.      

247
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,379
the rings will be bolted    

248
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,082
to the play structure's frame and anchoring system.     

249
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,987
finally, workers assemble the cables into a grid,    

250
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,990
locking each intersection with a plastic connector.   

251
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,127
to ensure they won't rust from exposure to the elements, 

252
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,796
the connectors' central screw and corner rivets

253
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,664
are made of stainless steel.  

254
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,668
on the modular play structure, 
the children walk on a platform.

255
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,137
it's constructed from thick steel sheets,    

256
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,541
perforated by a robotic laser cutter.   

257
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,477
after bending the sheet in a press           

258
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,011
to the required shape --    

259
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,414
this is the corner section of the platform --       

260
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,083
workers heat it in an oven... 

261
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,019
then submerge it in a vat of polyvinyl,     

262
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,522
which instantly adheres to the hot metal.       

263
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:59,264
they build up a good coat --  
about a 10th of an inch thick --

264
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,703
then let the excess drip off. 

265
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:14,579
they blast the entire piece with an airgun.        

266
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,714
this clears the holes     

267
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,283
and produces a textured, anti-slip surface.       

268
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,523
since playground equipment remains outdoors,       

269
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,059
all the paints and plastics are u.v.-treated        

270
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,961
to resist fading.       

271
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,166
besides being durable, the equipment is designed   

272
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,735
to meet all required safety standards 

273
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,137
so that parents can have peace of mind     

274
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,006
while their children have fun. 

275
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,027
narrator: food just slides off nonstick cookware's      

276
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,429
remarkably slippery surface.  

277
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,098
in 1938, an american chemist  

278
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,701
was experimenting with refrigeration gases.   

279
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,503
a waxy substance formed.    

280
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,105
years later, when bonded to cookware,    

281
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,408
it gained a nonstick reputation.

282
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,379
when it's time to fry,     

283
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:24,715
using a nonstick pan averts a messy situation.   

284
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,117
the nonstick coating      

285
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,053
is one of the slipperiest solid materials on earth.   

286
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,589
called polytetrafluoroethylene,

287
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,527
the name is a bit of a mouthful,
but the appeal is simple.   

288
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,130
food won't get stuck on this nonstick surface.   

289
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:43,535
to make the aluminum pan, they use 70% raw material   

290
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:47,739
and 30% leftovers from prior production of pots and pans.  

291
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,474
they fire it to a molten state 

292
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,609
and filter it to remove contaminants.    

293
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:55,814
the liquid aluminum flows   
into vertical rectangular molds.

294
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,016
a jacket of water around the molds        

295
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,886
cools the aluminum to take it from a liquid to a solid.   

296
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,623
a crane extracts the cast slabs.

297
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,824
they're heading to a heating chamber      

298
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,560
to soften the slabs.      

299
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,763
this will allow the metal to be shaped and formed.    

300
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,834
a saw slices the slabs in two and trims the ends.      

301
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,303
more blades scrape the top and bottom           

302
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,104
to remove impurities.     

303
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,108
a conveyor repeatedly feeds the shorter slabs       

304
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,576
to heated rollers.       

305
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,645
guides at the side maintain the width,      

306
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,913
while the rollers compress the aluminum,         

307
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:33,184
taking the thickness down to about .2 of an inch.  

308
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,655
the rolling also elongates the slab substantially.    

309
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:39,391
it starts out at 6 1/2 feet long,      

310
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,125
and after a few minutes of rolling,          

311
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,629
it's been stretched to well over 100 yards.    

312
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,465
pizza-cutter-style blades   

313
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,869
trim the edges of the aluminum sheet.     

314
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,773
another roller winds the aluminum into a big coil. 

315
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,277
they then unwind it      

316
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,413
and squeeze the aluminum to flatten it.         

317
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,684
machinery now pulls the long aluminum sheet forward

318
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,953
to a 132-ton punch press.   

319
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,289
this powerful press forces the metal        

320
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,157
around a frying-pan-shaped die 

321
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,694
and then punches out the shape.

322
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:17,829
the freshly formed aluminum frying pan      

323
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,564
falls onto a conveyor below.  

324
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,102
the leftover aluminum will be used to make new frying pans. 

325
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,572
the pans now ride a conveyor through a washing station,   

326
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:31,443
where they're cleaned and then treated with sodium hydroxide. 

327
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,311
this opens the pores of the metal          

328
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,648
to allow an enamel coating to stick to the outside    

329
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,718
and the nonstick finish to adhere to the inside.    

330
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,387
a worker inspects the pans   

331
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,590
and places them upside-down on spray fixtures.       

332
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,792
it's a tight fit to shield the inside      

333
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,128
from the enamel spray that comes next.        

334
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,132
the pans spin on the fixtures and twirl by the spray nozzles 

335
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,267
for an even application of enamel           

336
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,869
to the exterior of the pans.  

337
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,539
a clear, glossy coat follows. 

338
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,542
the frying pans transfer to a dryer conveyor.      

339
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,478
the hot air pulls out water from the enamel coating,    

340
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,083
and the color goes from gray to chalky white.        

341
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,752
an automated squeegee     

342
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:16,620
silk-screens the company's name
and other information     

343
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,357
onto the pan bottoms.     

344
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,160
they now enter a long curing oven       

345
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,496
heated to 1,040 degrees fahrenheit.          

346
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,832
the cure toughens the enamel, 

347
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,301
deepens the color so it turns gray again,    

348
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,437
and it adds gloss.       

349
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,106
a suctioning device picks up the pan        

350
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,042
and turns it around for the inside coatings.    

351
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,311
a sprayer applies a special primer        

352
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,314
that will make the nonstick coating adhere to the pan.   

353
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,716
it then applies the nonstick coating.     

354
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,718
the pans receive two layers  

355
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,588
of this nonstick synthetic substance.      

356
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,590
the suctioning device releases the pan,       

357
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,193
and it lands upside down.   

358
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,929
then the pans journey through the oven again     

359
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,731
to cure the nonstick finish  

360
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,800
at around 800 degrees fahrenheit.          

361
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,002
on exit, water rains down   

362
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,473
to cool the pans and rinse off any contaminants.

363
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,875
then they go through an infrared-light chamber   

364
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,544
to dry off.          

365
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:16,881
from a plain shell to a pan with
an enamel finish on the outside 

366
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,417
and a nonstick coating on the inside,         

367
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,553
the transformation has taken just one hour.    

368
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,555
a worker now aims a laser   

369
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,690
and aligns it with lettering on the bottom, 

370
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,493
allowing him to punch holes in a precise location     

371
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,829
on the side of the pan.    

372
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,765
he slides pins into the holes 

373
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,968
and slots them through holes in the handle fitting.     

374
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,237
using a ram, he flattens the pins      

375
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,707
to rivet the handle to the pan.

376
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:47,746
now, no matter what's cooking, cleanup should go smoothly.
