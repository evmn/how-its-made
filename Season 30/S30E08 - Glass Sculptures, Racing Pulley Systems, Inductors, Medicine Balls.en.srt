      as an artistic medium     

10
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,990
  dates back to ancient egypt.  

11
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,460
  despite the obvious fragility 
      of glass sculptures,

00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,996
          this art form         
     has an enduring appeal.    

13
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:07,667
    the transparency of glass   
 often has a ghost-like quality.

14
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:11,304
  they're tangible works of art 
  that are skillfully crafted.  

15
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,608
    with this glass sculpture   
           of a horse,          

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,478
    the artist's two passions   
        come together --        

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,213
      art and horsemanship.     

18
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,486
  the artist takes inspiration  
         from her horse,        

19
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,489
       observing the swell      
   of his muscles as he romps   

20
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,126
   in order to create the same  
   sense of movement in glass.  

21
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,966
     she then draws a series    
    of sketches of the horse    

22
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,834
      in different stances.     

23

24
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,772
     they help her work out     
      the sculpture's form      

25
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,075
  before actually creating one. 

26
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,783
   she cleans solid glass rods  
 to prepare them for sculpting. 

27
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,719
   this is borosilicate glass,  
     which is more resistant    

28
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,857
        to thermal shock        
   than other kinds of glass.   

29
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,994
  she brings the glass into the 
 flame of a torch to soften it. 

30
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:13,399
   once softened, she can fuse  
    two of the rods together.   

31
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,869
  then using tweezers and flat, 
        knife-like tools,       

32
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,204
      she sculpts the glass     

33
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,173
         into the shape         
  of the horse's hips and legs. 

34
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:26,078
 she works quickly so the glass 
      doesn't have a chance     

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,913
      to cool and fracture.     

36
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:37,089
   she adds a smaller piece of  
 glass and forms it into a tail.

37
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,626
 she constantly turns the glass 
  as she works it to make sure  

38
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,162
 it looks good from all angles. 

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,767
   she melts glass in front of  
  the hips to build up the body 

40
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,070
  and shape the horse's belly,  
        back, and chest.        

41
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,243
        this is intensive       
       and precision work.      

42
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:00,379
    the piece must be exposed   
    to a well-adjusted flame    

43
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,048
      and constantly moved      

44
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,317
  so it doesn't become too hot  
       and melt too much.       

45
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,724
   she adds glass to the front  
    and sculpts the shoulders   

46
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,492
   and part of the front legs.  

47
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,398
   she removes a little piece   
         of extra glass.        

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,668
   she deposits the sizzling,   
      unwanted bit in water     

49
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,139
         to cool it down        
    and dispose of it safely.   

50
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:29,809
       she does more work       
       on the front legs.       

51
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,945
   she'll refine them and form  
          hooves later,         

52
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:37,349
 but now she bakes the partially
 sculpted glass horse in a kiln.

53
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,084
  this is the first annealing,  

54
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,555
    which realigns molecules    
      to prevent cracking.      

55
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,891
   she forms the head and mane  
    separately from the body.   

56
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,693
  this is more intricate work.  

57
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,029
        the features are        
       much more detailed,      

58
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,631
   so she uses smaller tools.   

59
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,834
once she shapes the eye sockets,

60
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:58,837
     she melts little blobs     
    of black glass into them.   

61
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,640
      she sculpts the eyes      
       with a flat knife.       

62
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,115
  she carves creases above them 
   to create an eyelid effect.  

63
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,786
  she adds glass for the ears.  

64
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,121
    then, using a tool called   
            a masher,           

65
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:20,726
      she pinches the ears      
    to squeeze them thinner.    

66
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,594
      she heats them again.     

67
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,865
 this process can cause the ears
       to stick together,       

68
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:29,401
        so she cuts them        
        to separate them.       

69
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,871
       she curls the ears       
         using tweezers         

70
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:34,473
    and tweaks their position   
      on the horse's head.      

71
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,812
       she melts the base       
    of the head to the body,    

72
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,081
      and they become one.      

73
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:48,087
she fuses more glass to the back
        to craft a mane,        

74
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,657
  and after another annealing,  
    she returns to the legs.    

75
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,628
      she softens them with     
          a flame again         

76
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,166
       and adds definition      
     to the fetlock joints.     

77
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:06,372
   she cuts the tips to create  
      a more level surface.     

78
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,507
      she melts black glass     
   on to the ends of the legs   

79
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,977
       and sculpts it into      
      the shapes of hooves.     

80
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,583
     with a series of tools,    
      she tweaks each hoof      

81
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,452
      until she's satisfied

83
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,459
    after another annealing,    
  she shines a polarized light  

84
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,329
      through the sculpture     
  and examines it for stresses  

85
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,332

124
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,338
  the factory sends all pulleys 
      out to a plating shop     

125
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,472
    which coats the aluminum    
         with the hard,         

126
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,544
     black protective finish    
       known as anodizing.      

127
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,282
    this is a different type    
      of crankshaft pulley.     

128
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,552
  to make it, the automated saw 
       first cuts a patty       

129
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:08,887
  from a smaller aluminum bar.  

130
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,026
    then, a worker mounts it    
   on a computer-guided lathe.  

131
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,828
      after the first tool      
     evens out the surface,     

132
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,598
     this tool drills a hole    
       through the center.      

133
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,238
     the next tool enlarges     
           that hole.           

134
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:34,646
   the next tool cuts a female  
    pattern inside the hole.    

135
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,182
  a female pattern has grooves  
          which receive         

136
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,619
 corresponding protruding areas 
       of a male pattern.       

137
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,527
    the lathe then transfers    
  the patty to another spindle  

138
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,363
   to expose the opposite side  
         for machining.         

139
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,269
 the first tool shapes the back.

         a male pattern.        

142
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,614
    with a female pattern on    
   one side and a male pattern  

143
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,952
 on the other, multiple pulleys 
 can be stacked and interlocked 

144
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,422
 to accurately align the system.

145
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,460
  the final tool cuts straight  
 teeth for a square-tooth belt. 

146
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,765
     when an original engine    
      component is replaced     

147
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,436
with a new, smaller, and lighter
    one suitable for racing,    

148
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,840
   the factory must also make   
   a smaller, lighter bracket   

149
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,377
   to mount the new component   
         to the engine.         

150

  cut by the same automated saw 

152
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,151
      that cut the patties      
        for the pulleys.        

153
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:54,059
     brackets, like pulleys,    
      go out for anodizing.     

154
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,061
       when they come back      
        to this factory,        

155
00:09:56,063 --> 00:10:01,132

   first, the technician bolts  
           an adapter           

159
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,341
    to the harmonic balancer.   

160
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,276
      the harmonic balancer     
         is a component         

161
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,813
         on all engines         
     that lessens vibration.    

162
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,550
        next, he installs       
    the new crankshaft pulley   

163
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:22,420
 on to the adapter, attaching it
    with a long central bolt    

164
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,023
       that extends beyond      
      the harmonic balancer     

165
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:29,027
      and into the engine's     
           crankshaft.          

166
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,696
  he installs a new lightweight 
           water pump,          

167
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,233
which has a new mounting bracket
       for the alternator       

168
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,102
   attached to its left side.   

169
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,905
     then, he bolts on a new    
       water-pump pulley,       

170
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,574
which has grooves for two belts.

171
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,043
      after mounting a new      
     lightweight alternator,    

172
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,713
   he connects the water-pump   
    pulley to the crankshaft    

173
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,982
 and power steering pump pulleys
          with one belt         

174
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,319
  and to the alternator pulley  
       with another belt.       

175
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,789
    this allows simultaneous    
   steering, battery charging,  

176
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,559
      and water circulating     
       to cool the engine.
