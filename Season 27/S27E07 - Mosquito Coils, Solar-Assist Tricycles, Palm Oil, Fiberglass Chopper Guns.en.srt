narrator: being eaten alive by mosquitos is no picnic...   

5
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,257
well, except to the mosquitos.  

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,392
not only are the bugs annoying,            

7
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,661
but just one bite from an infected mosquito    

8
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,930
can transmit potentially debilitating     

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,632
or fatal diseases        

10
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:11,037
such as the west nile virus, malaria, and dengue fever.    

11
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,008
one way to ward off mosquitos is to light a coil        

12
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,277
that releases mosquito-repelling vapors.    

13
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,747
these coils, manufactured in thailand,    

14
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,749
contain three natural ingredients       

15
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,418
traditionally used in this country         

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,487
to keep those biting bugs at bay --            

17
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,960
eucalyptus, citronella, and turmeric.          

18
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,828
the first step is to mix them          

19
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,230
with certain nonactive natural ingredients       

20
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,899
which form the coil --      

21
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,301
coconut shell powder, sawdust,  

22
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:45,303
tapioca starch, and joss powder,         

23
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,239
an adhesive made from the bark and leaves     

24
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,377
of the litsea glutinosa tree.  

25
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,512
after blending         
all these powdered ingredients  

26
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,514
for 10 to 15 minutes,      

27
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,383
workers bag the mix in an empty ingredient sack,   

28
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,554
then empty the contents in a kneading tank.       

29
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,124
they add fragrance and dye.   

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,794
the coil comes in four varieties.        

31
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:13,732
this batch of coils will be pink and cherry blossom scented.   

32
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,269
then, they add the coil's only chemical active ingredient,           

33
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,537
metofluthrin.          

34
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,141
its vapors are toxic      
to mosquitos' nervous systems,  

35
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,210
yet harmless to humans in low doses.     

36
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,781
metofluthrin makes up less than 1% of the mosquito coil.     

37
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:34,286
after about 10 to 15 minutes of kneading, the mix       

38
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:38,090
exits the tank as a formable paste.       

39
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,826
a conveyer belt transports it to an extruder,  

40
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,896
which squeezes the paste through a slot-shaped die,    

41
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,867
producing sheets approximately 4 millimeters thick.       

42
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,839
a stamping machine then punches out seven coils per sheet.    

43
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,909
the leftover paste travels back to the extruder   

44
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,513
to be reformed into fresh sheets ready for stamping        

45
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,248
while the stamping machine    

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,185
ejects the paste coils onto a mesh tray.        

47
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,592
workers conduct a visual inspection       

48
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,562
and remove any coils which are misshapen.       

49
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,936
then they stack the trays onto trolleys.          

50
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,945
they roll the trolleys into the drying chamber,     

51
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:37,149
which they heat to a temperature of 131 degrees fahrenheit.    

52
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,226
after 5 1/2 hours, the coils   

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,097
come out of the drying chamber hard and sturdy.         

54
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,035
after conducting another visual inspection, workers       

55
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:01,240
transfer the dried coil     
to the automated packing line.  

56
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,775
the machine's first station stacks       

57
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,845
the coils in piles of five.   

58
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,714
workers place a metal coil stand              

59
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,383
on each stack.          

60
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,851
then, the machine's next station             

61
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,788
packages each stack in clear plastic film.      

62
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,525
the package holds the five coils tightly together         

63
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,660
so they don't rattle against each other        

64
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,195
and get damaged.         

65
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:28,667
it also prevents the scent from dissipating before use.   

66
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,937
at the next station,      
a high-speed robotic arm grabs  

67
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,806
and opens the retail boxes,   

68
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,677
aligning them opposite the arriving packages of coils.             

69
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,450
the machine inserts a package of coils into each box...    

70
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,823
then closes the box.       

71
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,961
before packaging the mosquito coils,       

72
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,296
the company lab tests      

73
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,834
randomly selected samples from the batch.         

74
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,770
the chemist lights a piece of coils and places       

75
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,072
it in the center of a sealed test chamber.    

76
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,846
five minutes after the coil has completely burned,      

77
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,716
she releases mosquitos into the chamber         

78
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,220
and clocks how much time elapses until they're debilitated.    

79
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,262
the lab also conducts a burn performance test.     

80
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,465
this verifies that the coils take between 7 and 8 hours    

81
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,034
to burn completely.       

82
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,739
these mosquito coils also come in lavender, rosemary,            

83
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,541
and herbal blend scents.     

84
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,477
provided they're kept sealed in their plastic package     

85
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,279
and stored away from moisture,  

86
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:51,350
the active ingredients remain effective for at least 10 years.             

87
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,234
narrator: the solar-assist   
tricycle takes urban commuting  

88
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,035
in a whole new direction.    

89
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,172
it's part tricycle and part motorized vehicle.   

90
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,375
the motor runs on a lithium-ion battery     

91
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,578
that gets its juice from the solar panel on the roof.   

92
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,114
and it can also be plugged into an electrical outlet    

93
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,849
for a charge.          

94
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,056
the solar-assist tricycle is a vehicle for change.     

95
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,726
propelled by both pedal power and solar energy,        

96
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,797
it's an alternative way to get around town.       

97
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,400
making a solar-assist tricycle starts         

98
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,469
with the side panels for the cab.           

99
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:47,873
they've been thermoformed from rugged plastic.       

100
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,878
an employee cuts open doorways in the panels using a router.  

101
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,413
a fender was molded into the cutout         

102
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,081
to minimize waste.        

103
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:04,023
he cuts a hole in the panel to assemble that fender.     

104
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,958
another employee then peels off the plastic film         

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,095
that has protected the panel during the cutting process.   

106
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,432
she attaches led signal lights  

107
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,936
and headlights to the tricycle body.      

108
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,242
she connects the lights to the wiring harness.      

109
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,185
the molded fender completes the tricycle side panel.     

110
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,656
she hangs it on a rack      

111
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,259
to await the next stage of production          

112
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,127
and writes the order number on it           

113
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,731
in order to keep track of it.  

114
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,865
they build the frame       

115
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,601
from tempered aircraft-grade aluminum.            

116
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,004
an employee mounts crank arms and chain rings to the front   

117
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,874
and then attaches pedals.    

118
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,743
the crankset transmits human pedal power        

119
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,546
to the drivetrain.        

120
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,083
next up is the antlers,     

121
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,417
an assembly of metal tubes    

122
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,619
that includes the suspension mechanisms    

123
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,422
and steering linkage.      

124
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:14,292
they install steering arms at the ends of the antlers,   

125
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,428
then mount an aluminum dashboard support  

126
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,097
to the antlers.         

127
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:21,032
he inserts the steer tube for the handlebars into the slot              

128
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,301
in the dashboard support.    

129
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,105
he connects the steering linkage to the antlers          

130
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,508
using swiveling joints for precise handling.      

131
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,911
he inserts the handlebar into the steer tube.       

132
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:36,114
the team then secures two rugged bicycle wheels    

133
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:40,386
to the axle using cap bolts.   

134
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:43,322
they position the 1-horsepower motor and transmission      

135
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:46,392
between the tricycle's parallel spines         

136
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,594
and attach them with brackets and bolts.     

137
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,196
they loop a roller chain from the crank          

138
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,530
to the transmission       

139
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,133
and another one from the transmission      

140
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,602
to the rear drive wheel.     

141
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,937
they also link the motor to the rear wheel        

142
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,274
with a roller chain.       

143
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:05,344
they equip all three wheels with disc brakes.        

144
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,150
they install aluminum casing over part of the rear wheel   

145
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,885
and driveline.          

146
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,954
this protects these components  

147
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,958
and also provides structural support.       

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,962
a computerized tool now carves into corrugated polypropylene  

149
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,198
to create a box for the vehicle battery.     

150
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,969
an assembler then rivets the battery box      

151
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,572
to the front of the solar-assist tricycle.  

152
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,576
the team attaches metal struts  

153
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,713
to serve as supports for the vehicle body.      

154
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:46,051
they're now ready to assemble  
the body parts to the chassis.  

155
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,253
they align each panel to the frame           

156
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,456
and bolt it in nine locations.  

157
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,060
the fenders frame the wheels to keep road spray down.     

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,333
they fasten side mirrors to the vehicle,         

159
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,936
drilling the bolts through the body         

160
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:07,739
to the dashboard support.    

161
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,677
the employee then applies decals that identify the product.    

162
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,546
he protects the motor and transmission         

163
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,616
with a rugged plastic bonnet.  

164
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,351
and he screws the adjustable seat       

165
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,887
to the tricycle's aluminum spine.         

166
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,960
the team curves the flexible solar panel to the top.     

167
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,700
they attach the windshield to the front           

168
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,636
using high-strength double-sided tape.        

169
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,671
the windshield is made of polycarbonate         

170
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,642
that's optically clear and shatterproof.        

171
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,513
after the installation, he peels off the protective liner.    

172
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:54,786
the next worker inserts the battery in its compartment.          

173
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,188
he clips it shut,        

174
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,059
and the solar-assist tricycle is ready for the road.      

175
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:05,063
with its egg-shaped cab, it's certainly unusual-looking.        

176
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,799
and that's fitting because this hybrid vehicle   

177
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,035
is something entirely different.           

178
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,550
narrator:            
most people use palm oil daily  

179
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,486
and don't realize it because it just blends in.    

180
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,489
it's a component of half of packaged food products.    

181
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,293
and it's also used in cosmetics, detergents,    

182
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,094
and even biofuels.        

183
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,164
it has a smooth texture, a natural taste.         

184
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,366
and it's a natural preservative.          

185
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,706
brought to southeast asia from africa a century ago,    

186
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,242
oil palms have thrived here.   

187
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,111
today, this region generates 85%               

188
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,515
of the world's palm oil supply.             

189
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,317
at the heart of this palm oil boom      

190
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:02,921
are breeding programs that ensure high yields.     

191
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,858
technicians start by dissecting the fruit bunches.        

192
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,794
they analyze the quality of the fruit fibers,       

193
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,529
kernels, and nuts.        

194
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,466
they also assess their oil content.             

195
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,869
this identifies the most productive palms,        

196
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,338
as well as the trees       

197
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,542
best suited to particular growing environments.      

198
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:27,279
next, the research team climbs the selected mother palms              

199
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:30,015
and pollinates         
the female flowers with pollen  

200
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,551
from high-quality male palms.  

201
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,554
they cover the flowers with thick fabric        

202
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,955
that allow light in       

203
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,224
but shields them from accidental pollination   

204
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:43,094
by insects and from other flowers.     

205
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,498
this ensures that hybrid seed will be the product       

206
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,967
of the selected parents only.  

207
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,169
it takes 6 months for the new hybrid seeds     

208
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,638
to be produced.         

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,774
then it's into a heat chamber for 3 months           

210
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,377
to break the seeds' dormancy.  

211
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,713
they soak the awakened seeds in water.            

212
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,182
along with the heat treatment, this rehydrating         

213
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,451
accelerates germination --    

214
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,122
a process that takes many years in nature.      

215
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,324
they place the seeds in drawers             

216
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:16,395
and regularly mist them with water.         

217
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:21,533
after a few days, the seeds begin to sprout.    

218
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,670
skilled staff sort through the sprouted seeds.   

219
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,740
they reject any that haven't germinated completely      

220
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,877
or that have crooked shoots.   

221
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,415
the seed on the left is the ideal specimen.      

222
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:40,818
they plant the selected seeds  
in small bags of soil outside.  

223
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,221
they shade them during     
this initial period of growth,  

224
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,291
protecting them from harsh sunlight.       

225
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:51,296
after 3 months, the seedlings develop roots and leaves.    

226
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,031
they transfer them to larger bags of soil,     

227
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,767
and 6 to 9 months later,     

228
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,573
they're 3 feet tall and ready for planting in farmers' fields.             

229
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:06,244
after 3 years of growth, the young palms bear fruit.   

230
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:10,382
the time is now ripe to tap into the oil-generating potential   

231
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,718
of these huge fruit bunches.   

232
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,521
the farmer loads the oil palm fruit        

233
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,889
onto a tractor cart.       

234
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:23,228
and it's on its way to the palm oil factory.     

235
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,066
here, fruit from many farms   

236
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,670
accumulates in the receiving area.      

237
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,672
when the factory is ready to process the next batch,    

238
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,942
they open a gate.        

239
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,745
the fruit spills onto a conveyer.         

240
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,550
and it delivers it to giant pressure cookers.    

241
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,422
cooking the fruit sterilizes it.               

242
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,159
it stops enzyme activity    
that would degrade the quality  

243
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,629
of the oil that's to be extracted.     

244
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,964
it also loosens the fruit from the stalks,         

245
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,834
and some break away.       

246
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:06,104
a spiraling blade moves them onto a grid screen        

247
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,707
that sorts the fruit from the stalks.         

248
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,910
the loose fruit drops into a bin below.        

249
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:17,515
and the stalks with remaining fruit go for further separating.           

250
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,784
next, presses crush the fruit  

251
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,522
to squeeze out the crude palm oil.       

252
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,924
the oil flows into a vat.    

253
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,194
impurities will now be spun out in a centrifuge         

254
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,464
and also filtered out.      

255
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:36,601
meanwhile, the fibers and palm nuts toss in a drum.  

256
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,071
this knocks off fibers that are stuck to the nuts.   

257
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,139
a fan sucks up the lighter fibers,      

258
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,476
which will be used as factory fuel.         

259
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,944
they crack the nuts,       

260
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,280
and then a vibrating system   

261
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,683
separates the shells from the actual kernels.     

262
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,887
the shells will also be used as factory fuel.     

263
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,558
and the kernels will be crushed into palm kernel oil.      

264
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
in the lab, they now test samples      

265
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,429
to determine the oil extraction rate     

266
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:08,633
and confirm that the yield is good.     

267
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,836
they also analyze the oil's purity              

268
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:14,306
and the amount of free fatty acids.       

269
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:18,910
they confirm that the batch is of good quality.       

270
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,111
this crude palm oil has gone   

271
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,514
through many stages of purification.         

272
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:25,249
and although tests confirm it,  

273
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,853
the difference is also plain to see.      

274
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,135
narrator: today, everything from boats to outdoor furniture    

275
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,937
to shower stalls are molded            

276
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,940
out of fiberglass-reinforced plastic resin.          

277
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,075
this wouldn't be possible    

278
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,209
without a tool called a chopper gun.      

279
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,279
it shreds the fiberglass into thin, loose fibers     

280
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,215
and impregnates them with resin              

281
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:01,319
while shooting them into the mold.          

282
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,289
a fiberglass chopper gun has a chopper that shreds    

283
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,759
and shoots the fibers, a nozzle that sprays those fibers     

284
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,563
with resin, and a catalyst to harden it, an air cylinder  

285
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,965
that drives the entire system,  

286
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,969
and separate pumps for the resin and catalyst.   

287
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,437
the make the resin pump,     

288
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,239
they first cut a stainless steel tube      

289
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,441
to a length of about 10 inches.             

290
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,313
all the pump's key components are made of stainless steel,   

291
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,683
which is very durable and doesn't rust.        

292
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,856
this tube will become the cylinder for the resin pump.              

293
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,792
they turn it on a computer-guided lathe.   

294
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,395
the first machining tool reduces the tube         

295
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,865
to the required diameter.    

296
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,000
the second machining tool cuts a groove          

297
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,136
in the cylinder for an assembly pin.       

298
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,577
they manually file the edges of the cylinder smooth,     

299
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,281
then polish the entire surface with sandpaper          

300
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,885
to remove marks left by the machining.        

301
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,954
once all the components are ready,            

302
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,757
they begin assembling the resin pump.         

303
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,960
it has a ball valve at the top and another at the bottom,    

304
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,496
which open with suction and close with pressure     

305
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:22,834
to enable or block the flow of resin.        

306
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,570
workers fit a rubber o-ring seal around the seat         

307
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,172
for the bottom ball,       

308
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:31,576
then insert the seat into the bottom of the pump.   

309
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,613
this retaining clip holds the seat in position.   

310
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,652
they fit another o-ring seal on top,             

311
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,590
then place the ball,       

312
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,124
about 10 inches in diameter,   

313
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,860
in the seat.           

314
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,933
this spring retainer limits how high the ball can rise    

315
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,202
when it's lifting to open the valve.        

316
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:02,807
next, they attach the pump cylinder.        

317
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,411
they take a preassembled upper ball valve,        

318
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:11,216
attach a thermoplastic piston seal, then a retainer      

319
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,885
that holds the seal in position            

320
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,219
as the pump's piston,      

321
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,754
which they now screw on,     

322
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,158
moves up and down with the pumping action.     

323
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,626
they insert the piston into the cylinder.        

324
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,963
the tight fit creates a vacuum when the piston moves upward,  

325
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,567
drawing resin into the pump and pressure    

326
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:34,239
mo when the piston ves downward,  

327
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,575
next, they add the top of the pump,           

328
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,044
then assemble the top seal,   

329
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:42,714
which contains a guide held in place by a retaining clip   

330
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,182
that aligns the vertical movement      

331
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,385
of the piston.          

332
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,854
they screw the top seal to the pump top.         

333
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,125
they secure the top       

334
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:58,529
by inserting a pin into the cylinder groove.    

335
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,999
the chopper's main components are the cutting head,      

336
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,601
the anvil sleeve, and a hard rubber roller,    

337
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,137
which the chopper's air-driven motor spins,     

338
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,607
rotating the cutting head at 4,000 revolutions per minute.             

339
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,081
this bearing pulls the woven fiberglass yarn, called roving,             

340
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,951
into the cutting head, which has slots         

341
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:23,555
for up to eight supersharp stainless steel blades.     

342
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:29,293
the more blades you use, the shorter the chopped fibers.             

343
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,362
this safety cover prevents fingers         

344
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,065
from accidentally getting chopped in the process.     

345
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,237
they mount the chopper to this spray gun.        

346
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,838
the lines from the resin     

347
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,242
and catalyst pumps connect to the back of the gun.              

348
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,445
at the front of the gun, dual nozzles           

349
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,648
simultaneously spray these chemicals onto the fibers             

350
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,617
right after they exit the chopper.           

351
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,924
workers mount the resin pump  
on a stand along with a filter  

352
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,595
that prevents the nozzle from clogging.          

353
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,732
they install the air cylinder, then mount the catalyst pump   

354
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,333
and hook up lines from both pumps         

355
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,270
to the spray gun.        

356
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,872
to operate the machine,     

357
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:17,008
you hook up an air compressor to the machine's air input,   

358
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,612
connect the pumps to the resin and catalyst reservoirs,     

359
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,416
and set how much catalyst to deliver.           

360
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,885
then you insert a strand of fiberglass roving       

361
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,221
into the chopper and let her rip.         

362
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,092
no resin and catalyst in this demonstration,      

363
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,228
but normally, they hit the fibers       

364
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,031
about 4 inches in front of the chopper gun,       

365
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,366
which shoots a stream      

366
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,702
of fiberglass-reinforced resin into your mold.
