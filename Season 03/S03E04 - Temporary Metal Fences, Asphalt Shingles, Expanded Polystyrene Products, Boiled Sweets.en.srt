00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,124
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,660
...temporary metal fences...

3
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,732
...asphalt shingles...

4
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,839
...expanded polystyrene products...

5
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,044
...and hard candies.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,388
temporary metal fences securely cordon off

7
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,524
dangerous areas on construction sites.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,594
at open-air events such as concerts and festivals,

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,730
they mark the perimeter and help direct traffic flow.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,533
seasonal businesses such as garden centers

11
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,802
use them to protect their merchandise

12
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,704
from thieves and vandals.

13
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,609
it all starts with a giant spool,

14
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,547
roughly 4 1/2 miles of galvanized steel wire.

15
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,352
a machine called the "straightener"

16
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:31,056
uncoils the spool and straightens out the wire.

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,706
the next machine cuts the lengths they'll need

18
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,808
to construct the fence panels.

19
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,719
a worker feeds those wire lengths into another machine,

20
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,522
arranging them in the proper configuration.

21
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,524
the lights show where they go

22
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,260
for this particular model of fencing.

23
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:14,066
these lengths will form the panels' vertical pieces.

24
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:19,438
the machine carries them over to
the automated welding station.

25
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,945
at the welding station,

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,548
a magnetic arm grabs the panels' horizontal pieces

27
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,618
and feeds them, one by one,

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,154
into position over the vertical pieces.

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,890
then the welding begins.

30
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,426
this is electrical welding.

31
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,494
a strong electric current zaps the joints,

32
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:47,365
melting the metal and fusing the pieces together.

33
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,701
it's faster and neater than traditional welding.

34
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,916
the machinery then stacks the welded panels

35
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,618
and moves them down the production line.

36
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,869
some panels are welded

37
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,205
on another kind of electrical welding machine.

38
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,742
it feeds the horizontal pieces onto the vertical ones

39
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,612
using a different technique.

40
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,448
but the result is the same.

41
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,438
workers position each welded panel

42
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,906
in a manually operated pneumatic press.

43
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,110
then they bend the panel at certain key points.

44
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,849
this makes it more rigid and, therefore, stronger.

45
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,397
next, workers trim off the surplus wire

46
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,799
sticking out along the edge of the panel.

47
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,939
and then the final step --

48
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,808
they position a round galvanized steel post

49
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,777
on each side of the panel.

50
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,492
a robotic welder then welds these side posts in place.

51
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,967
when it comes time to erect this temporary fence,

52
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,437
all they'll have to do is place each panel

53
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,638
in footings that sit on the ground,

54
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,709
then line up the panels side by side

55
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:14,079
and attach them by clamping together the side posts.

56
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,194
all the fence components

57
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,432
are made of heavy-duty galvanized steel.

58
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,734
that makes this temporary metal fence highly durable,

59
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,472
maintenance-free, and rustproof.

60
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,483
narrator: asphalt roof shingles come

61
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,218
in many different colors, textures, and patterns.

62
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,088
they're one of the least expensive roofing materials.

63
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,424
they're also very durable.

64
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,760
some even carry a lifetime warranty.

65
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,064
but they can only go on a roof with a steep-enough slope.

66
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:14,505
at the heart of every asphalt shingle is a membrane.

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,042
it can be made from fiberglass

68
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,312
or, like this one, from organic fibers

69
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:25,450
like wood chips, recycled cardboard, and paper.

70
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:35,660
the giant rolls of membrane feed
what's known as a "felt looper."

71
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,395
it builds up enough reserves

72
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,731
so that workers can change rolls as needed,

73
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,067
without stopping production.

74
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,678
from there,

75
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,814
the membrane enters a machine called the "saturator,"

76
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,417
where it's drenched in hot liquid asphalt,

77
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,219
a petroleum derivative.

78
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,955
when this saturant dries,

79
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,725
the membrane will be impermeable.

80
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,303
next comes a thicker asphalt coating,

81
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,572
mixed with powdered limestone.

82
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,842
they apply it to both the top and bottom.

83
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,178
this coating will make the membrane flexible.

84
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:32,984
it will also form a protective barrier against harsh weather.

85
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,852
with that coating still wet,

86
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,523
they spread color ceramic granules over the top surface.

87
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,126
this gives the shingles their color

88
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,897
and makes them resistant to the sun's ultraviolet rays.

89
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,533
granules that don't stick to the wet asphalt

90
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,902
get recycled back into the system.

91
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,875
next they apply a cellophane strip to the back surface

92
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,246
so the shingles won't stick together in the package.

93
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,685
then they shower the back surface with powdered stone,

94
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,987
also to prevent sticking.

95
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,893
even by this point,

96
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,762
the asphalt coating is still piping hot,

97
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:21,699
too hot for the shingle material
to be cut to size.

98
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,902
so it's off to the cooling section,

99
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,037
where cold rollers and water jets

100
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,139
bring down the temperature.

101
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,246
the next machine applies strips
of adhesive asphalt.

102
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,582
the sun's heat will activate them,

103
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,852
keeping the shingles stuck to each other.

104
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,722
the process to this point is the same, regardless of color.

105
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,592
the only thing that will differ
from this point on

106
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,995
is how the shingle's bottom edge
is cut.

107
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,131
that determines the shingle's profile.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,467
on the way to the cutting station,

109
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,603
the shingle material passes through the finish looper.

110
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,206
like the felt looper we saw at the beginning,

111
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,874
the finish looper accumulates enough reserves

112
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,477
so that production won't come to a standstill

113
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,214
if there's a problem.

114
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:13,685
the cutting machine cuts to size and profile.

115
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:18,023
standard shingles measure 39" x 13.3".

116
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,358
this model has a straight edge,

117
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,895
but some styles have a curved bottom.

118
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,265
an automatic counter keeps track of production.

119
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,175
the machine automatically stacks
the shingles for packaging,

120
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,645
usually 21 sheets to a bundle,

121
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:45,350
which is enough to cover roughly 32 square feet of roof.

122
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,931
asphalt shingles come in about 50 different colors

123
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,802
and in about a dozen different shapes and profiles.

124
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,741
they wrap each bundle of shingles

125
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,277
in paper that's been treated with polyethylene

126
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,812
to prevent water penetration.

127
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,814
the bundles then go onto pallets,

128
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,150
which the factory wraps in a plastic bag

129
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,686
that's water- and u.v.-resistant.

130
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,356
the warranties on asphalt shingles

131
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,426
range from 20 years to lifetime.

132
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,495
generally, the thicker the asphalt

133
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,430
and granule protective barrier,

134
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,368
the more durable the shingle, and the longer the guarantee.

135
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,311
narrator: we call it "packing foam,"

136
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,247
but its real name is "expanded polystyrene packaging,"

137
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,650
those feather-light white foam inserts

138
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,586
that come with many boxed items.

139
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,922
they not only secure the merchandise within the box --

140
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,792
they also act as a shock absorber

141
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,927
during transport.

142
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,267
polystyrene plastic comes in tiny pellets

143
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,203
about 4/100 of an inch in diameter.

144
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,840
the first step is to expand them
inside a steam chamber.

145
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,011
the 392-degree-fahrenheit heat

146
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,080
causes the pentane gas in the pellets to escape,

147
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,150
allowing air to enter the pellets

148
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:29,154
and inflate them up to 40 times
their original size.

149
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,564
here are the polystyrene pellets
before...

150
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,733
and after expansion.

151
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:49,174
the factory then bags the pellets in huge sacks.

152
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,113
to make expanded polystyrene products,

153
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,048
they start by dumping sacks of expanded pellets

154
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,852
into what's called the "block mold" machine.

155
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,189
the more pellets they put per cubic yard,

156
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,258
the denser the product will be.

157
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,402
they steam-fuse the pellets together,

158
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,270
molding them into a block

159
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:25,276
that's roughly 16 feet long by 3 feet wide by 2 feet high.

160
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:29,413
this molding process takes from 5 to 20 minutes,

161
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,117
depending on the density.

162
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,025
a scale built into the conveyor belt weighs the block

163
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:45,430
to make sure it meets specifications.

164
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,498
depending on its density,

165
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:51,970
a block this size can weigh anywhere from 99 to 440 pounds.

166
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,255
now the block is ready to be cut

167
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,258
into whatever product the client has ordered.

168
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,400
expanded polystyrene is best known as packaging material,

169
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,337
but it also has many other uses.

170
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,473
here they are slicing a block into insulation panels.

171
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,278
builders use expanded polystyrene insulation

172
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,748
for basements, roofs, foundations,

173
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,951
and inside and outside walls.

174
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,641
regardless of the product,

175
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,378
they cut polystyrene blocks using a copper-and-nickel wire

176
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,780
that's electrically heated.

177
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,783
it melts the polystyrene on contact,

178
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,119
enabling fine, precision cuts,

179
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,623
almost to the hundredth of an inch.

180
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,432
to make expanded polystyrene packaging,

181
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,535
they custom-cut the specific shapes required.

182
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,804
these squares they're gluing together

183
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,073
have been ordered up by a furniture manufacturer.

184
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,210
they're designed to fit onto the bottom of chair legs

185
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,880
to protect them from damage during shipping.

186
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,356
this machine handles more detailed and complex jobs.

187
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,758
its cutting wire is guided by computer software,

188
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,562
so it can cut virtually any design.

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,168
expanded polystyrene is a low-cost alternative

190
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:09,240
for making commercial signs that can be hung indoors or out.

191
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,443
a sign made of high-density expanded polystyrene

192
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,380
and coated with a quality exterior paint

193
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,549
has an outdoor life-span of a few years.

194
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,124
this moldable product

195
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,795
has endless creative and commercial uses.

196
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,472
narrator: they come in different colors,

197
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,407
different shapes and sizes,

198
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,010
in flavors ranging from fruity to minty,

199
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,413
from tart to tangy.

200
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,148
pretty much everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy

201
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,750
from time to time.

202
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,752
for children and adults alike,

203
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:58,690
these sweet treats are just irresistible.

204
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,598
our love of sweets goes back to the caveman,

205
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,434
who delighted in eating honey from beehives.

206
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,569
in ancient times,

207
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:17,508
people indulged in treats made of honey-covered fruit and nuts.

208
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,046
in the middle ages, europeans made candy from boiled sugar.

209
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,582
but the high cost of imported cane sugar

210
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,318
restricted this delicacy to the wealthy.

211
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:32,656
candy finally became affordable
for the masses in the 1800s,

212
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,793
with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar,

213
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,730
the sugar beet.

214
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,074
these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections.

215
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:55,213
they're gourmet candies, custom-made and crafted by hand.

216
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,947
the candymaker starts

217
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,217
by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil.

218
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:05,823
then he adds glucose, a thick syrup made from starch.

219
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,759
he heats the mixture to a specific temperature,

220
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,696
depending on what type of candy he's making,

221
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,465
and lets it cook for about a half-hour.

222
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,436
then he stirs in liquid flavoring.

223
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,772
once the mixture is evenly blended,

224
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,173
he pours it onto a cooling table.

225
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,578
the candymaker has several flavorings at his disposal,

226
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,915
from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors.

227
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,052
he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings.

228
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,122
this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle,

229
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,526
so he and his assistants are working with three colors --

230
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,594
green for the leaves,

231
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,199
red for the berry, and yellow for the background.

232
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,071
to enhance the flavor, they add citric acid.

233
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,275
then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down

234
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,877
and hardened enough to be malleable.

235
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,946
they separate the pieces by color

236
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:06,017
and put each piece on a heated table

237
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,486
to slow the hardening process

238
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,288
so that the candy will remain pliable.

239
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,691
now they create the design.

240
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,227
they form various shapes and sizes

241
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,696
and, like a puzzle, put the pieces together

242
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,766
to make a jumbo version of the candy design.

243
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,844
once they have assembled the red berry and green leaves

244
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,713
and yellow background,

245
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:39,984
they roll on more yellow background...

246
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:44,789
then a layer of red for the outside trim.

247
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,791
all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy

248
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,128
into a bite-sized version.

249
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,800
to do that, the candymaker pinches one end

250
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,334
and stretches it out

251
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,070
to form a long, uniform strand called a "rod."

252
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:04,942
he cuts the rod into pieces almost 2 feet long,

253
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,212
but he has to keep rolling them
until they cool and harden,

254
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,615
or else they'll go flat.

255
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,951
when the rod is just the right diameter,

256
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,487
the design is in perfect proportion.

257
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:20,324
all they have to do now is cut candy-size pieces.

258
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,165
they use the same technique to make kiwi candy,

259
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,568
pink grapefruit candy,

260
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,238
and banana candy, to name just a few varieties.

261
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,708
want to order up some candy with a personalized message?

262
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,943
here's an "l"...

263
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,649
an "o," a "v"...

264
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,684
an "e"...

265
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,659
...a "y"...

266
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,393
"o"...

267
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,129
...and "u."

268
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,737
again, they create a yellow background and red trim.

269
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,810
then it's more pinching, pulling, rolling, and cutting...

270
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:20,184
...until the rods are down to just the right size.

271
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,228
if you look at the back end of each rod,

272
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,831
you'll see the lettering is in reverse.

273
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,334
that will be the underside of the candy.

274
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,642
when the raw candy comes off the cooling table,

275
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,976
it's transparent.

276
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,245
to make it opaque or lighten the color,

277
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:52,116
they'll pull it on a hook.

278
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,984
here, they intertwine two colors

279
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,120
and feed the rod through a special machine

280
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,323
that forms bands of pillow-shaped candies.

281
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,191
after cooling,

282
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,660
they simply break them apart by hand.

283
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:08,232
if you're no sucker for hard candies, no problem.

284
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,636
they can also twist rods into lollipops.
