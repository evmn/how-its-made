00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:26,491
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,227
         photographs...         

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,732
        ...fur tanning...       

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,705
    ...welding electrodes...    

5
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,477
    ...and electric violins.    

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,986
          in the 1830s,         

7
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,723
     the first photographers    
 used light-sensitive chemicals 

8
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,858
   to capture images on paper.  

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,860
today, machines do much the same

10
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,663
     but with amazing speed,    
   accuracy, and versatility.   

11
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,667
  it's a tried and true method  
    many people still prefer    

12
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,170
     to make their memories     
         into pictures.         

13
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,746
the photo lab receives envelopes

14
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,881
    containing rolls of film    
         for developing.        

15
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,217
    processing will turn each   
 exposure into a negative image 

16
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,619
      and then a positive.      

17
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,823
  that positive is what we know 
        as a photograph.        

18
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,227
 a scanner takes a digital photo

19
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,029
       of the order detail      
   specified on the packages.   

20
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,632
        it tracks things        
  such as print size and finish 

21
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,434
    and the number of copies    
          you ordered.          

22
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,239
      a conveyer then sorts     
    the envelopes into bins,    

23
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,007
          grouping them         
      with similar orders.      

24
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,852
    next, a machine extracts    
         the film rolls         

25
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,387
     from the metal capsules    
       in total darkness.       

26
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,257
   exposing the film to light   
     would ruin the photos.     

27
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,393
  the envelopes go into bundles 
 so they can later be re-matched

28
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,163
     with the right pictures    
         and negatives.         

29
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,801
     here's what the machine    
       looks like inside.       

30
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,206
       a blade cuts open        
       the metal capsule,       

31
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,807
     and another slices off     
           the leader.          

32
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,010
      the machine unravels      
          and lines up          

33
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,479
 as many as 60 films end-to-end.

34
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,548
     the films are just over    
        three feet long.        

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,616
    a sticker joins the ends    

36
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,453
    and identifies each film    
        with a bar code.        

37
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,889
      the machine measures      
      the assembled strip,      

38
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,493
    then winds it onto a reel   
       inside a metal box.      

39
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,701
another machine unwinds the reel

40
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,171
        and runs it under       
  a nondamaging infrared light  

41
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,973
      so that a technician      
      can check for tears.      

42
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,508
       just one tiny tear       
      could jam the machine     

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,478
    and ruin all the photos.    

44
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,919
  if the tech does find a tear, 
     he repairs it by hand.     

45
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,054
        he puts his arms        

46
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,722
        in the machine's        
        little dark room        

47
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,992
  so as not to expose the film  
        to regular light.       

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,799
     first, he applies tape     
     to reattach the area.      

49
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,169
 blades then cut the tape evenly
         on both sides.         

50
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,411
    the worker is able to see   
         what he's doing        

51
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,415
    on a tv monitor hooked up   
  to an infrared camera inside. 

52
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,620
    developing the exposures    
  requires four chemical baths  

53
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,088
       still in the dark.       

54
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,225
   in the first, sulfates make  
 the image appear as a negative.

55
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,293
 the second includes acetic acid

56
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,428
       to halt the effect       
        of the sulfates.        

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,497
       the last two baths       
       preserve the image       

58
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,132
 and rinse away chemical traces.

59
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,303
     to print the pictures,     

60
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,306
   workers load the negatives   
   into yet another machine.    

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,441
        this one contains       
     light-sensitive paper.     

62
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,312
     all it takes is a flash    
     to transfer the image.     

63
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:11,116
  but that light is powerful,   
  almost as bright as the sun.  

64
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,518
   a sensor instantly adjusts   
          the intensity         

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,321
to correct any improper exposure
      by the photographer.      

66
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,058
     to develop the prints,     

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,260
     the paper goes through     
       four chemical baths      

68
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,730
      similar to those used     
       for the negatives.       

69
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,468
   one bath reveals the image,  
   another stops that process,  

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,140
 and two more preserve the image
  and rinse off the chemicals.  

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,613
   what's different this time   

72
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,349
        is that the paper       
 then heads into an oven to dry 

73
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,853
         for two minutes        
   at 160 degrees fahrenheit.   

74
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,165
   now a technician marks the   
  pictures that are too bright, 

75
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,033
    too dim, or out of focus,   

76
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,870
      and then removes them     
       for redevelopment.       

77
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,108
              next,             
  a machine unwinds the strip,  

78
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,309
      scans the bar codes,      

79
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,645
    and cuts out the pictures   
      that belong together.     

80
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,382
   it also cuts the negatives   
  into numbered strips of four. 

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,921
       a worker now slips       
 the proper photos and negatives

82
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,256
        into an envelope.       

83
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,457
     the computer shows her     
        what to include,        

84
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,593
          and a machine         
  provides the original package 

85
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,495
        the film came in.       

86
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,802
    when you get your photos,   

87
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,339
       you can check them       
  against your original order.  

88
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,606
    that way, you can ensure    

89
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,176
        that everything's       
        picture-perfect.        

90
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,827
 narrator: fur has been in style
    since prehistoric times.    

91
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,828
 talk about a fashion original. 

92
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,765
      in those early days,      
 fur garments were pretty basic.

93
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,034
       their main purpose       
    was to keep people warm,    

94
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,702
         a primary need.        

95
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,905
           these days,          
 fur is often a fashion choice, 

96
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,175
      but it still provides     
      old-fashioned warmth.     

97
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,450
      at the tanning plant,     

98
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,519
     a worker sorts through     
        raw beaver pelts        

99
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,721
      purchased at auction.     

100
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,057
     he inspects the quality    
          of the hair,          

101
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,659
    then determines the type    
of garment they're suitable for.

102
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,001
     he hammers a lot number    
 into the underside of the pelt.

103
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,403
     it perforates the skin.    

104
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,870
     this technique is used     

105
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,774
    so that the number stays    
 on the pelt during processing. 

106
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,481
    using a pneumatic punch,    
 he cuts out the ear cartilage. 

107
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,817
      it's a crucial step.      

108
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,152
      they need to get rid      
    of the cartilage early on   

109
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,790
   so the pelts can go through  
certain machines during tanning.

110
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,166
  the pelts are a bit dried out 

111
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,967
             because            
   of preservation techniques   

112
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,770
 used before they were delivered
      to the tanning plant.     

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,105
       to rehydrate them,       

114
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,908
      they put them through     
    various chemical washes.    

115
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,444
         the final bath         
   contains tanning chemicals.  

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,315
   they convert the underside   
 of the animal skins to leather.

117
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,650
   the supple leather texture   
      will allow the pelts      

118
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,253
     to eventually be shaped    
         into garments.         

119
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,329
       between each wash,       
   the furs go into a ringer.   

120
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,165
 it spins out the excess liquid.

121
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,214
        all that moisture       
 has caused the pelt to thicken,

122
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,682
      so they thin it down      
      with a spinning blade     

123
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,618
    called a flesher's knife.   

124
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,366
    you need to be an expert    
       to wield this tool.      

125
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,701
         one false move,        

126
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,704
       and you'll cut into      
   the follicles and lose fur.  

127
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,812
 next, a worker shovels sawdust 
        into a big drum.        

128
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,782
     he gathers up the pelts    

129
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,385
   and places them in the drum  
     along with the sawdust     

130
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,587
  and adds a mineral solution.  

131
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,861
         the drum turns,        

132
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,130
         tossing it all         
     for about half an hour.    

133
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,901
   this cleans and conditions   
 the leather side of the pelts. 

134
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,581
   the furs emerge still damp,  

135
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,483
       so they hang them        
       over wooden dowels       

136
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,619
        leather side up.        

137
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,688
     the rest of the sawdust    
         will fall away         

138
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,224
    in subsequent operations.   

139
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,565
    now a worker scrapes off    
      the pelt's long hair      

140
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,167
 to expose the downy undercoat. 

141
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,104
    this undercoat has a more   
   desirable look and texture.  

142
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,513
he rubs a generous amount of oil

143
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,416
  into the leather of the pelt  
        to lubricate it.        

144
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,660
    then he tosses the pelts    
       into a kicker box,       

145
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,329
            so named            
   for the automated kickers.   

146
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,200
    the kicking action causes   
 the oils to penetrate the skin.

147
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,607
  next, a spinning metal wheel  
 tugs at the pelt to stretch it.

148
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,216
 a worker cuts away the edges...

149
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,286
  and it's into the hot-press.  

150
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,422
   this irons and adds luster   
           to the fur.          

151
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,962
      after a quick brush,      
  the pelts get one more press. 

152
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,633
     then a shearing machine    

153
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,069
         cuts the hairs         
       to an even length.       

154
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,040
            finally,            
    they bundle up the pelts    

155
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,641
           for a trip           
     to the garment factory,    

156
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,478
     where they'll be great     
        design material.        

157
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,597
            narrator:           
    more than a century ago,    

158
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,998
       welders first fused      
       two metal surfaces       

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,867
    by melting a metal stick    
            over them           

160
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,869
   using an electric current.   

161
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,672
    that stick is now called    
      a welding electrode.      

162
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,809
        it's the simplest       
  and most popular way to weld. 

163
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,011
      farmers and mechanics     
       often use this tool      

164
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,514
   to repair heavy machinery.   

165
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,022
    this company's electrodes   

166
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,424
 are coated with powdered metals
          and minerals.         

167
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,026
during welding, the metals melt,

168
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,628
        and the minerals        
  protect the area from oxygen, 

169
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,764
  which would weaken the bond.  

170
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,166
     the electrode transmits    
       an electric current      

171
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,168
      that heats and melts      
       both the electrode       

172
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,372
     and the metal surfaces,    
     welding them together.     

173
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,180
         thin metal wire        
   forms the electrode's core.  

174
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,849
    the kind of wire depends    

175
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,717
      on what the electrode     
      is designed to weld.      

176
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,788
 but most often, the core's made
  of carbon or stainless steel. 

177
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,393
 a machine simultaneously spins 
          and bends it,         

178
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,664
    evenly reshaping the wire   
 until it's completely straight.

179
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,067
       four metal rollers       
  then push and guide the wire  

180
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,969
       into a guillotine.       

181
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,741
    the blade chops the wire    
          into segments         

182
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,144
        that will become        
      the electrode cores.      

183
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,614
  these segments range from 10  
     to 17 1/2 inches long.     

184
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,760
   the factory puts a variety   
     of metals and minerals     

185
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,028
         in the coating.        

186
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,098
  the metals are often nickel,  
          manganese...          

187
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,833
            and iron.           

188
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,967
         the minerals --        

189
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,571
       alumina, magnesia,       
         and limestone.         

190
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,275
    they also add a colorant    
  to differentiate the models.  

191
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,917
   workers mix the ingredients  
       with a bit of glue       

192
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,921
         until they turn        
 to the consistency of wet sand.

193
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,323
   a worker then packs the mix  
         into a machine         

194
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,760
    that forms it into slugs    
  with a hole down the middle.  

195
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,664
     he adds a plastic cap.     

196
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,735
  then a metal cover slides on, 
   and the machine takes over.  

197
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,204
     it takes only a minute     
    for the machine's piston    

198
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,406
     to compress the powder     
          into a solid.         

199
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,415
  now to put the powder coating 
       on the core wires.       

200
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:43,354
    a worker loads four slugs   
    into an extrusion press.    

201
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,023
     it will apply 120 tons     
    of pressure on the slugs    

202
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,025
       to shoot the powder      
         through nozzles        

203
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,360
    that will coat the wires    

204
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,830
      as they pass through      
        the slug's hole.        

205
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,435
        to load the wires       
         into the press,        

206
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,071
      they first stack them     
         in this feeder.        

207
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,041
    the opening at the bottom   

208
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,376
          is adjustable         
     for different diameters    

209
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,511
       because core wires       
    range from spaghetti-thin   

210
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,314
        to pencil-thick.        

211
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:13,117
 these rollers pass them through
    the press one at a time.    

212
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,527
 four wheels then pull the wires
         from the feeder        

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,596
    into the extrusion press    
           for coating          

214
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,800
       at a rate of up to       
   1,000 electrodes a minute.   

215
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,007
   when the coated electrodes   
             emerge,            

216
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,141
     they hit a metal wheel     

217
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,977
       that positions them      
         on a conveyer.         

218
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,815
        a sander removes        
  up to 2 1/2 inches of coating 

219
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,418
         from the bottom        
  where you grip the electrode, 

220
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,686
      and it bevels the tip     

221
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,622
   so it conducts electricity   
          even better.          

222
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,891
       a worker now checks      
       for uneven coating       

223
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,527
    and to see if the wire's    
         well centered.         

224
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,097
        the coating dries       
       at room temperature      

225
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,233
       for up to 72 hours.      

226
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,434
      to cure the coating,      

227
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,436
   workers put the electrodes   
           in an oven           

228
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,374
heated to 905 degrees fahrenheit
       for up to 5 hours.       

229
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,507
      once they've cooled,      

230
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,843
         the electrodes         
   head into a printing press.  

231
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,445
          an ink wheel          
     first prints the model     

232
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,914
       and type of current      
        that's required.        

233
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,389
 another ink wheel then applies 
  a color to the gripping end.  

234
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,590
        it's another way        
   to differentiate the model   

235
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,028
      in case the lettering     
on the side rubs off in storage.

236
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,864
           from there,          
     it's off to packaging.     

237
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,200
       an optical scanner       
     counts the electrodes.     

238
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,069
     then a stacking machine    
         separates them         

239
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:42,006
 into 7.7- to 11-pound bundles. 

240
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:46,144
 finally, a worker inserts them 
    into cardboard canisters.   

241
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,612
  he adds a piece of cardboard  

242
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,348
    to compress them tightly    
          for the trip.         

243
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,083
  a sticker marks the contents, 

244
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,187
   and tape keeps the package   
         tightly sealed.        

245
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,036
     narrator: the invention    
     of the electric violin     

246
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,572
    was all about turning up    
           the volume.          

247
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,307
it was back in the big-band era,

248
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,308
          and the sound         
    of the traditional violin   

249
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,112
         was overpowered        
     by the horns and drums.    

250
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,848
      amplifying the violin     
       changed everything.      

251
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,051
   suddenly, the violin wasn't  
    just a background sound.    

252
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,120
    it was part of the show.    

253
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,193
        the wired violin        
    comes in different shapes   

254
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,931
     because it doesn't rely    
 on the body to resonate sound. 

255
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,069
         this craftsman         
   builds his electric violins  

256
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,203
      one piece at a time,      

257
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,805
     starting with the neck.    

258
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,142
       he traces the shape      
     onto a piece of maple.     

259
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,280
then, he outlines the top plate.

260
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,415
         he uses walnut         

261
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,483
       for the lower bout,      
         or bottom part,        

262
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,754
   as well as for the backbone  
         of the violin.         

263
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,025
  next, he cuts out the shapes  
        using a band saw.       

264
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,460
          his goal here         
      is to be very precise     

265
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,629
   because the closer he gets   
         to the outline,        

266
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,332
        the less sanding        
     he'll have to do later.    

267
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,906
         the dimensions         
      for the top and neck      

268
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,308
      are exactly the same      
    as a traditional violin,    

269
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,911
so there won't be any difference
     in the reference points    

270
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,414
    the violinist relies on.    

271
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,864
         the lower bout         
       is very stylized...      

272
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:50,334
and the head is more streamlined
   than a traditional violin.   

273
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,804
  there's no decorative scroll. 

274
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,547
  next, he chisels out a cavity 
    in the head of the violin   

275
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,183
      to create the pegbox.     

276
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,356
   he carves parallel grooves   
          onto the back         

277
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,292
    to give it a snazzy look.   

278
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,496
          using a rasp,         

279
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,266
       he shaves the wood       
    to the correct thickness.   

280
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,840
         he drills holes        
       for the tuning pegs      

281
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,707
  into the side of the pegbox,  

282
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,111
          one for each          
      of the four strings.      

283
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,181
   he files down the grooves    
   on the back a little more.   

284
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,116
         then he scrapes        
      the rest of the neck      

285
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,152
   to give it a final finish.   

286
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,991
         using a reamer,        
    he tapers the peg holes.    

287
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,393
         the ebony pegs         
      have matching tapers,     

288
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,929
       so they fit snugly       
         into the holes.        

289
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:58,469
     he checks to make sure     
     everything measures up.    

290
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:04,008
    now he brushes wood glue    
      onto the next section     

291
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,044
      and presses the ebony     
      fingerboard onto it.      

292
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,149
          he wraps them         
      with surgical tubing      

293
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,052
      to hold them together     
      while the glue dries.     

294
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,826
  he drills two assembly holes  
        in the top piece        

295
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,263
  and makes corresponding holes 
       in the other parts.      

296
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,170
      he smoothes the edges     
         of the backbone        

297
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,339
   with an oscillating sander.  

298
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,443
then, using a high-speed router,

299
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,080
 he bevels the lower bout piece 
    to give it a clean edge.    

300
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,119
   he rubs teal-colored stain   
          into the wood         

301
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,255
       because loud colors      
        seem appropriate        

302
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,058
            for these           
    high-volume instruments.    

303
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,727
    a crystal has been glued    
 into the violin's wooden bridge

304
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,730
     to generate electricity    
  from the string's vibrations  

305
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,465
        and create sound.       

306
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,334
        he pulls the wire       
         from the bridge        

307
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,336
     through the backbone...    

308
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,608
   ...and then mounts the bout  
        to the backbone.        

309
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,580
   he bolts an ebony chin rest  
             on top.            

310
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,687
   next, he attaches the neck   
  to the rest of the assembly.  

311
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,092
           he loops on          
      the ebony tailpiece.      

312
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,931
        he pulls a string       
  from the tailpiece to a peg.  

313
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,034
      the act of tightening     
        the first string        

314
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,402
       raises the bridge,       

315
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,105
   which will be held in place  
        only by tension.        

316
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,912
    now it's time to hook up    
   the violin to the amplifier  

317
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,416
        and let the music       
   tell the rest of the story.
