00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,758
narrator: today on "how it's made,"   

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,127
electrical panels...      

3
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,699
...kites...          

4
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,371
...eyeglass frames...     

5
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,177
...and toothbrushes.      

6
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,054
the technical name for it is a residential load center, 

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,723
but people usually call it an electrical panel      

8
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,191
or circuit breaker box.    

9
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,193
this enclosed metal panel   

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,863
is usually built into an interior wall     

11
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,798
and contains the circuit breakers      

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,134
that distribute, protect, and control          

13
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,869
the home's lighting and power. 

14
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,410
this load center consists of up to 40 circuits.     

15
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,745
each one has one or two breakers.    

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,883
each breaker powers several outlets in the home.  

17
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,619
first, a powerful press pounds a sheet of steel        

18
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,488
into what's called a u-channel.

19
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,757
at nearly 3 feet long, 18 inches wide,        

20
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,891
and 4 inches deep,       

21
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,293
it's part of what's called the tub --           

22
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,962
the load center's main casing. 

23
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,832
a worker then attaches steel components made earlier 

24
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,234
called tub ends.        

25
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,302
a spot welding machine fuses them           

26
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,105
to close off both ends of the tub.     

27
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,040
workers feed an aluminum strip 

28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,643
that's 330 feet long and 6 inches wide       

29
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,245
into a stamping press.     

30
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,247
the press cuts the strip into 20-inch-long segments   

31
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,850
called bus bars.        

32
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,653
it bends each bus bar 10 times,

33
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,523
creating two-inch segments called stabs.         

34
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,795
the breakers will later snap onto these stabs.     

35
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,665
next, a worker inserts each bus bar          

36
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,268
into a plastic component called a base pan.       

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,737
the base pan insulates the bus bar.     

38
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,606
this prevents us from getting electrocuted.   

39
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,142
another press then inserts a plastic rivet,        

40
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,412
securing the bus bar to the base pan.        

41
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,414
the worker installs two components,        

42
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,750
called neutral bars, in the base pan.        

43
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,618
the neutral bars conduct electricity      

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,555
between the circuit and the wall socket.      

45
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,490
next comes the main breaker.  

46
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,293
its maximum capacity is 200 amps.          

47
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,028
amps are the units of measurement         

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,496
for electrical current.    

49
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,032
if demand exceeds maximum capacity, it'll trip, 

50
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,769
meaning it'll turn off all power in the home.     

51
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,705
she makes sure it's sufficiently tight    

52
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,775
so that vibrations caused by street traffic won't loosen it.

53
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,912
she also encloses labels to mark the breaker's pathways 

54
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,815
and an envelope with installation screws.   

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,721
next, the worker puts the base pan assembly into the tub 

56
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,791
and secures the neutral bar with a copper bonding strap  

57
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,860
to ground it and prevent electrocution.   

58
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,264
she adds another component -- one of two grounding bars.   

59
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,800
these ground each circuit.   

60
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,403
the breakers simply snap onto the stabs,  

61
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,739
making them easy to remove and replace if needed.     

62
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,274
inside the breaker,      

63
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,944
several components interact to enable the flow of electricity.

64
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,279
one is the load terminal --  

65
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,347
the entry point for the live current.     

66
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,751
a circular machine, called robot "a," assembles it 

67
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,188
and other breaker parts along its 16 workstations.   

68
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,428
another breaker component is the bimetal assembly.    

69
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,097
it's an alloy of two metals and a magnet.         

70
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,365
it trips the breaker when there's an overload    

71
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,835
or a short circuit.      

72
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,239
next, robot "a" welds a strip of silver, which is conductive,

73
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,307
to what's called the contact arm.        

74
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,380
robot "a" then positions the arm
for welding          

75
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:12,451
with two-inch-long segments of braided copper wire --   

76
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:16,388
copper because it's conductive as well as pliable.      

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,457
the robot fuses the copper wire
to the contact arm       

78
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,393
in the bimetal assembly.    

79
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,862
the wire will flex with the arm

80
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,197
to touch what's called the line terminal.       

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,867
this contact permits the electrical current to flow.

82
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,004
next, robot "a" deposits the welded parts        

83
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,606
into the breaker casings, called bases.         

84
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,810
this automated production line functions 24 hours a day,   

85
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,478
five days a week,       

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,782
and it produces a breaker every three seconds.      

87
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,162
another machine, called robot "b,"       

88
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,366
stamps the number of amps on each breaker handle.    

89
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,102
then it connects a spring   

90
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,237
to link the contact arm to another part,        

91
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,905
called the cradle.       

92
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,374
when there's an overload,   

93
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,576
the bimetal assembly causes the cradle to pivot      

94
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,911
and trip the breaker.     

95
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:17,115
robot "b" deposits the spring and cradle into the base,   

96
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,518
then closes the base with a cover.         

97
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,257
this demonstration shows how moving the breaker handle 

98
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,728
triggers the mechanism that will
enable the flow of electricity. 

99
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,396
if power demand exceeds    

100
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,733
the breaker's maximum capacity by 35%,            

101
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,737
the bimetal assembly trips the breaker and cuts the power.

102
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,405
they cap off the load center  

103
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:41,940
with a metal cover called a trim.         

104
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,341
the warning label on it    

105
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,745
provides safety information and instructions.       

106
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,147
the load center is now ready for installation        

107
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,516
by a certified electrician.  

108
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,759
narrator: the earliest written record of a kite    

109
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,028
tells the story of a chinese general in 206 b.c. 

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,165
who flew a kite over a wicked emperor's palace.

111
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:11,036
he marked the line to measure 
the distance, then reeled it in.

112
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,572
his small army then dug a tunnel
into the palace courtyard,   

113
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,609
launching a surprise attack that conquered the emperor.  

114
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,252
today's two-line kite, as the name implies,      

115
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,120
has two lines to pilot it.   

116
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,990
it can fly nearly 130 feet high.

117
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,126
this kite is made mainly of a lightweight nylon fabric 

118
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,662
that is waterproof and fade-resistant.      

119
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,865
it's less than a few hundredths
of an inch thick,       

120
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:44,135
so it's reinforced with nylon mesh to reduce ripping. 

121
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,604
the kite's other components  

122
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,139
include nylon and elastic cords and straps;       

123
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,276
fittings made of leather, rubber, aluminum, and plastic; 

124
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,844
and carbon rods.        

125
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,349
the kite maker starts with a pattern         

126
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,683
made out of pressed wood.   

127
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,551
she marks out a piece of the fabric     

128
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,021
and, with a few bricks to hold the fabric in place,  

129
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,288
cuts diagonally.        

130
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,492
in sewing terms, that's called cutting on the bias.      

131
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,629
this will stretch the fabric and help it fly.        

132
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,298
next, she cuts more pieces of fabric,           

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,233
this time in a different color.

134
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,836
this kite has eight fabric parts
that fit together like a puzzle 

135
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,106
to create an eight-foot wingspan.    

136
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,043
the kite's left and right sides
are mirror images,       

137
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,445
so there are only four different shapes to cut. 

138
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,383
they range in length from 9 inches to 4 feet.    

139
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,117
from start to finish,     

140
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,320
it takes one worker about two hours to make this model, 

141
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,823
called the dragonfly.     

142
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,193
first, the kite maker sews the longest part,       

143
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,328
called the belly, to the other parts.      

144
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,332
she double stitches with heavy-duty nylon thread  

145
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:52,070
to help the kite withstand winds
up to 23 miles per hour.    

146
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,206
she makes tiny incisions along the belly's curved edge 

147
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,878
so she can fold it and sew in what's called the tension line.

148
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,213
tension line is a type of nylon cord    

149
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,683
she'll sew into all the seams of the kite's lower sections. 

150
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,352
it'll give the kite some structure         

151
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,055
and help keep it rigid while airborne.        

152
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,559
the kite maker secures each line
with a knot          

153
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,828
which can later be loosened or tightened          

154
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,097
to adjust the kite's overall tension.  

155
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,234
the kite maker uses straps   

156
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,970
made of very durable, yet flexible, plastic     

157
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,506
to line the middle and the edges
of the wings.         

158
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,242
the straps strengthen the kite,

159
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:33,378
enabling it to survive crashes into trees and rocks.     

160
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,314
after all, what goes up must come down.  

161
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,385
next, the kite maker sews a piece of leather,      

162
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,653
called a fitting, onto the plastic strap.    

163
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,857
it's made of leather to protect
the kite's structural joints, 

164
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,459
such as the nose of the kite. 

165
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,628
it gets a leather patch, as well.            

166
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,067
the kite maker uses a serrated saw         

167
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,736
to cut the 10 carbon rods to size.            

168
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,538
they're a quarter-inch in diameter          

169
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,942
and range in length from 7 to 32 inches.      

170
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,746
they form the kite's skeleton and, like bones,        

171
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,215
they're the most likely part of the kite to break      

172
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,617
in an accident.        

173
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,887
but if they do break, it's easy to replace them.   

174
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,090
a variety of molded plastic, rubber, and aluminum fittings 

175
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,358
serve a dual purpose.     

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
they join the rods together  

177
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,230
and keep them from falling out of their sleeves.     

178
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,369
now the kite maker attaches a nylon cord, called a bridle, 

179
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:35,106
to the fitting that joins the 
rods on the wing's leading edge.

180
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,974
the bridle is the kite's rudder,

181
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,444
steering the kite to the left or right.     

182
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,981
the bridle comes off easily  
if you need to replace the rods.

183
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,187
the kite maker now attaches tension lines         

184
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,589
to two plastic components called arrows.         

185
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,059
they're located at the kite's wing tips.    

186
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,129
she ties elastic bungee cords through the arrows       

187
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,465
to hold the tension lines in place.           

188
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,868
this makes all the fabric parts
taut enough to fly.      

189
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,008
next, she attaches the bridle to the center rod,       

190
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,477
the spine of the kite.     

191
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,745
she inserts the rod      

192
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,982
into its protective leather pouch at the nose.   

193
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,754
she inserts other rods into both sides of the wing.  

194
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,557
these give the wing its curved,
aerodynamic shape       

195
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,559
and help the kite stay aloft. 

196
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,433
finally, additional rods under the wing         

197
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,368
provide more structure and support.          

198
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,538
these rods spread the kite and help keep it open.     

199
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,444
in the mood for a sky-high experience?   

200
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,648
for $250, you can buy a handmade model like this one 

201
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,884
and go fly a kite.       

202
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,797
narrator: eyeglasses don't merely correct vision.     

203
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,532
they're also a fashion statement --     

204
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,602
so much so that many of today's
top clothing designers     

205
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,072
produce a line of eyeglass frames.      

206
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,607
whether you prefer plastic frames or metal ones, 

207
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,677
they come in so many different colors, sizes, and shapes   

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,414
that you're guaranteed to find a pair that suits you.     

209
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,353
metal frames comes in a multitude of shapes,   

210
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,255
from ordinary to extraordinary.

211
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,624
it all starts with a computerized system     

212
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,027
called a three-axis eye winding machine.      

213
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,364
a set of rollers pulls metal wire from a big spool.  

214
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,233
then, with software-driven precision,

215
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,303
the machine bends the wire into the shape of the frame,  

216
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,439
then cuts the end free.    

217
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,777
the lenses will fit into precut grooves on the inside. 

218
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,114
a small part, called the insert,       

219
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,715
connects the two ends of the eye frame,       

220
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,052
holding them closed around the lens.        

221
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,921
to attach the insert, they put it in a clamp,    

222
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,725
then position the eye frame just above it.         

223
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:11,196
they apply a cleaning agent, called flux, then filler wire. 

224
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,998
an electric current heats the wire, metal frame,     

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,469
and insert until they all melt and fuse together.       

226
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,341
now they do the same to what's called the screw hinge --   

227
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,544
the piece that attaches the arm
to the eye frame.       

228
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,747
again, electrically generated heat  

229
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,815
fuses the hinge to the insert. 

230
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,119
this process, similar to soldering, is called brazing. 

231
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,956
now for the bridge --     

232
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,160
the piece over the nose that joins the two eye frames. 

233
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,498
a small press bends a piece of metal     

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
into the shape of the bridge. 

235
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,903
then a worker aligns it with the eye frames      

236
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,638
in an assembly jig.      

237
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,674
this ensures the frames are perfectly straight.    

238
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,815
brazing again melds everything together.   

239
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,661
next comes the piece above   
the bridge, called the brow bar.

240
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,398
an automated machine cuts metal 
wire to pieces the right length,

241
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,534
then carves grooves on the ends

242
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,602
to enable the brow bar to fit snugly         

243
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,504
onto the top of the frames.  

244
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,144
it then bends each piece to the right shape.      

245
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,756
the brow bar now goes into position.    

246
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,759
a little flux to remove any dust or dirt   

247
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,296
that might prevent the metal from fusing properly.     

248
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,632
then they braze the brow bar to the frame.         

249
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,777
now come little hooks called pad arms.        

250
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,381
they hold small pads under the bridge that cushion your nose. 

251
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,786
a worker fuses the pad arms to the frames         

252
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,790
using the same brazing process as before.           

253
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,870
now for the arms that attach to the eye frames on one end  

254
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,139
and sit on your ears on the other.         

255
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,274
the industry calls these arms temples    

256
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,344
because they're at the level of your temples        

257
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,346
when you wear the glasses.   

258
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,616
after stamping the size and company name on the inside,

259
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,485
they fuse a hinge to each one 

260
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,822
and press a plastic sleeve on the other end.       

261
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,370
they set the arms momentarily aside       

262
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,641
while they position the lenses in the groove of the eye frame.

263
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,117
a screw keeps everything tight and intact.          

264
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,122
now they screw an arm onto each hinge.        

265
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,670
the arms on most models have curled ends        

266
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:43,274
that hook over the ears for a 
more secure and comfortable fit.

267
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,610
a special machine, called a mechanical cam,    

268
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,945
applies pressure to bend the plastic sleeves  

269
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,914
to a 45-degree angle.     

270
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:59,490
these metal-frame glasses are functional and fashionable.

271
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,502
narrator: the chinese invented the first toothbrush      

272
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,770
around 1600,          

273
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,239
but it wasn't till about 1780 in england     

274
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,708
that it became a mass-produced item.     

275
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,977
like those that followed,   

276
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,046
its bristles came from the necks
and shoulders of pigs.     

277
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,647
in the late 1930s,       

278
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,185
synthetic materials replaced natural swine bristles.    

279
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,191
these toothbrushes should make you want to flash       

280
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,327
your pearly whites in appreciation        

281
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,529
if you consider that, thousands of years ago,    

282
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,465
people used twigs to clean their teeth.     

283
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,069
today's toothbrush begins as little plastic pellets.   

284
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:49,940
a vacuum sucks them up into an injection mold machine.

285
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,544
the machine melts the pellets into a kind of plastic dough, 

286
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,346
then injects it into a stainless-steel mold,  

287
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,150
forming 10 toothbrush handles at once.            

288
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,424
the head of each handle    
has up to 56 holes for bristles.

289
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,960
this machine generates 10 handles every 35 seconds.  

290
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:14,332
that works out to 27,000 handles
in 24 hours.          

291
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,637
now they melt blue rubber pellets.      

292
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,840
they pipe the liquid rubber into the mold         

293
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,776
with the white toothbrush handles,      

294
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,179
then press the rubber     
onto the handles to form a grip.

295
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,456
so now you'll have a toothbrush
you can really hang on to.   

296
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,858
no dropping this one in the sink.          

297
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,532
they use a semiclear plastic  
to produce another type of grip,

298
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,934
one that's softer and more pliable.       

299
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,470
it's called the gummy brush,  

300
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,872
because the grip really does feel a bit like        

301
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,441
one of those gummy candies.  

302
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,812
these nylon fibers will form the bristles.         

303
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,950
a robotic arm pats them down so that they sit very evenly. 

304
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,885
then, faster than you can blink an eye,         

305
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,221
the machine feeds the bristles into the holes         

306
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,558
in the head of the toothbrush handle.   

307
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,760
this machine works at a blurring speed,      

308
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,763
filling 900 holes per minute. 

309
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,399
and it operates with incredible precision.   

310
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,909
here's the bristle-selection process in slow motion.    

311
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,778
the machine selects between 22 and 24 bristles   

312
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,915
for each hole in the brush.  

313
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,318
with 56 holes per toothbrush, 

314
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,522
that adds up to over 1,300 bristles for each brush. 

315
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,261
this fully automated system  

316
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,331
works faster than any human ever could.   

317
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,400
and here's another advantage --

318
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,002
a human hand rarely has to touch
the bristles,         

319
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,639
so the process is incredibly hygienic.    

320
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,620
wondering what holds the bristles in place?     

321
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,022
wire.             

322
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,091
the machine bends the fibers in half,            

323
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:23,261
anchoring them to the brush with wire in the middle.    

324
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,239
now it's time for a brush cut. 

325
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,043
these blades trim the bristles to about the same length.   

326
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,846
another set of blades sculpts different types of edges,   

327
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,582
depending on the toothbrush model in production.      

328
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,386
these may look like spinning tops,      

329
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,787
but they're rotating disks coated with diamond dust,    

330
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,323
a mild abrasive.        

331
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,325
they sand the edges of the bristles        

332
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,727
to produce a particular finish.

333
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,797
for instance, the bristles can be straight or zigzagged. 

334
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,265
different finishes       

335
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,367
have different tooth-cleaning effects.    

336
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,807
you may have noticed that some bristles are white  

337
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,878
and others are blue or another color.       

338
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,348
this is purely aesthetic -- a nifty color combination   

339
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,784
to make the toothbrush look smarter.         

340
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,555
and, of course, the machine knows       

341
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,024
exactly which color goes where,

342
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,194
so you end up with a two-tone brush like this one.

343
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,096
every so often,        

344
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,433
the factory pulls a toothbrush off the assembly line     

345
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,500
for a spot check.       

346
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,769
a robot arm tugs at the bristles

347
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,171
to make sure they're secure enough.     

348
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,307
and if the brush passes the test,           

349
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,077
the rest of the production run is cleared for sale.      

350
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,716
then a robotic system packages the brushes          

351
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,185
so that they come right off the line ready for shipping  

352
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,456
and ready to maintain toothy smiles everywhere.   

353
