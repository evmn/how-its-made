        narrator: and...

00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,119
            narrator:           
     automatic sliding doors    

5
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,654
          are the norm          
      at most supermarkets      

6
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,489
      and large retailers.      

7
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,325
  sensors detect your approach  

8
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,328
      and prompt the doors      
         to slide open.         

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,731
    they open when you arrive   
   and close when you depart,   

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,701
       which is convenient      
    when your hands are full.   

11
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,071
  these automatic sliding doors 

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,475
     are custom-made to fit     
  the customer's door opening.  

13
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,878
the doors are programmed to open
        in 1 1/2 seconds,       

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,981
    but that can be adjusted    
      during installation.      

15
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,020
  the door structure and frame  
      are made of aluminum      

16
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,357
       that's been heated       
      to a softened state.      

17
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,161
 it's then forced through a die 
  to give it a specific shape.  

18
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,797
      a computer-guided saw     
   cuts these aluminum pieces   

19
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,734
     to the length required     
         for this order.        

20
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,637
    this is one of the pieces   

21
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,974
that will form the vertical side
     of the door structure.     

22
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,512
         workers insert         
    durable weather stripping   

23
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,781
     into a built-in track.     

24
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,384
  they collapse the end to lock 
       the strip in place.      

25
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,190
      on the opposite side,     
they fasten long, threaded rods.

26
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,926
        the rods are used       
      to attach the rails.      

27
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,195
   the rails fit over the rod   

28
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,397
    and are securely fastened   
        to the doorframe        

29
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,099
 with an alignment clip and nut.

30
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,275
   once workers have assembled  
    the two door structures,    

31
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,945
      they install a pivot      
     at the top of each one.    

32
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,414
 this top pivot allows the door 
        to swing outward        

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,451
          when you push         
     the emergency exit bar.    

34
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,893
       then, they assemble      
        the door hanger.        

35
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,796
      it connects the door      
    to the top of the frame.    

36
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,767
        the hanger rolls        
         on two wheels.         

37
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,635
      a urethane rubber one     
         allows the door        

38
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,239
        to move sideways        
       along the track...       

39
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,974
       and a plastic one,       
     which prevents the door    

40
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,409
    from going off the track.   

41
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,020
they attach the door's top pivot
         to the hanger.         

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,201
    an access control release   
   is needed to open the doors  

43
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,604
      in case of emergency.     

44
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,674
       workers install it       
 into sections of the doorframe 

45
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:32,044
  that meet when the two doors  
         close together.        

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,546
when you push the emergency bar,

47
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,850
     this mechanism rotates     
   to let the door swing open.  

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,092
   the hanger detent prevents   
   the door from swinging open  

49
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,960
    during normal operation.    

50
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,496
           it attaches          
   the access control release   

51
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,299
       to the door hanger.      

52
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,301
        workers complete        
       the door structures      

53
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,638
  by applying legally required  
         safety decals.         

54
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,045
 meanwhile, at another station, 
         workers install        

55
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,648
     the door's electronics     
         in the header.         

56
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,583
           this is one          
  of the many infrared sensors  

57
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,853
 that trigger the doors to open.

58
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,055
    the sensors detect people   
           approaching          

59
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,092
    by reading the invisible    
  heat energy humans give off.  

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,196
     after loading the nuts,    
     they'll need to fasten     

61
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,598
    the remaining components    
     to the header's track.     

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,134
     they install a pulley,     

63
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,137
    part of the drive system    
      that moves the doors.     

64
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,608
        then, they slide        
 the header's cover into a track

65
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,511
          and continue          
    installing components...    

66
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,480
      first, the end caps,      

67
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,417
     which attach the header    
        to the doorframe,       

68
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,154
   then, the door controller,   
the brains of the entire system.

69
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:53,158
         it has built-in        
      operational software.     

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,360
      you can run the doors     
         on the defaults        

71
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,696
   or customize the settings.   

72
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,498
        now, for the rest       
      of the drive system.      

73
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,567
 they install an electric motor 
           and pulley.          

74
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,337
   the motor has a switch that  
  detects the door's position.  

75
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,044
  next, a timing belt is looped 
       around two pulleys.      

76
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,716
    they adjust the distance    
       between the pulleys      

77
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,385
      to tighten the belt.      

78
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,919
   the door installers will do  

79
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,955
    a more precise adjustment   
            on-site.            

80
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,464
     every header undergoes     
 extensive computerized testing.

81
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,600
    this checks the function    
      and safety features.      

82
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,272
       then, the doorframe      
     and structure ship out     

83
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,673
      to the building site,     

84
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,711
   where the glass panes go in  
     prior to installation.     

85
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,691
        narrator: gin is        
  a distilled alcoholic spirit. 

86
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,160
     it's flavored primarily    
      with juniper berries.     

87
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,762
   in fact, the word "gin" is   

88
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,566
believed to come from<i> "jenever,"</i>
  the dutch word for "juniper." 

89
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,768
          it's the base         
 for many popular mixed drinks, 

90
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,571
      such as the martini,      
      the singapore sling,      

91
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,706
 and, of course, gin and tonic. 

92
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:22,381
  this microdistillery produces 
      gin in small batches      

93
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,450
   using a slower distillation  
            process.            

94
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,252
 they don't add any sweeteners, 

95
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,488
      artificial flavoring,     
          or coloring.          

96
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,859
       at this distillery,      
   everything is done by hand,  

97
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,630
     starting with the main     
  ingredient, juniper berries.  

98
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,467
    then, spices are added --   

99
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,603
  dried angelica plant roots... 

100
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,708
       coriander seeds...       

101
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,751
    lemon peel and cardamom.    

102
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,561
    all these ingredients go    
 into a 90-gallon copper still. 

103
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,630
       a spirit distilled       
      from fermented grain      

104
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,198
    is already in the still.    

105
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,968
    it's completely tasteless   

106
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,904
   but has an alcohol content   
             of 95%.            

107
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,906
   to lower the alcohol level   
             to 40%,            

108
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,443
       they've diluted it       
       with spring water.       

109
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,314
        now they prepare        
  to redistill with the spices. 

110
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,584
      this gives the spirit     
    its distinct gin flavor.    

111
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,455
  to do this, they slowly heat  
    the bottom of the still.    

112
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,160
  in about an hour, the alcohol 
 boils and begins to evaporate. 

113
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,332
    they continue distilling    
      for about six hours,      

114
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,335
      constantly monitoring     
        the temperature.        

115
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,605
       if the temperature       
      reaches 212 degrees,      

116
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:57,409
 the water will also evaporate, 
       ruining the batch.       

117
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,613
   the alcohol steam rises up   
      and out of the still      

118
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,183
    through pipes leading to    
 a chilled stainless steel tank.

119
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,154
       when the hot steam       
         hits the cold,         

120
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:14,092
 it condenses back to a liquid, 
          creating gin.         

121
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,432
           throughout           
    the distillation process,   

122
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:24,135
  they take samples to measure  
  the density and temperature.  

123
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:29,374
     these readings reflect     
   the current alcohol level.   

124
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,444
  they adjust the distillation  
        speed as required       

125
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:36,815
           to produce           
 a target alcohol level of 76%. 

126
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,052
 only the middle of each batch, 

127
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,656
      known as the heart of     
 the distillation, is collected.

128
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,196
   this particular distillery   
       adds another step.       

129
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,731
       they infuse the gin      
       with raw parsnips.       

130
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:59,471
 this gives it an earthy flavor 
    and subtle floral aroma.    

131
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,139
       they peel and slice      
          the parsnips,         

132
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,243
      place them in a tank,     
      then pump in the gin.     

133
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,080
     after a couple of days,    

134
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,283
  they pump it through filters  
  on the way to a storage tank. 

135
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,619
    then, they dilute the gin   
           with water           

136
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,755
   to lower the alcohol level   
             to 43%.            

137
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,625
        before bottling,        
  the distillery draws samples  

138
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,894
  for quality control testing.  

139
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,030
     they examine the color,    
           the aroma,           

140
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,432
   and, of course, the taste.   

141
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,702
 there will be slight variations
            in flavor           

142
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,938
     based on the freshness     
        of the parsnips.        

143
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,849
    this microdistillery has    
   no automated bottling line.  

144
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,687
  they fill the bottles by hand 
       only six at a time.      

145
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,593
      they cork each bottle     
          individually          

146
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,463
   with a hand-operated press.  

147
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,074
  they apply a plastic sleeve,  

148
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,943
 which they heat-shrink tightly 
         over the neck.         

149
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,348
       the consumer pulls       
        a small gold tab        

150
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,719
       to remove the seal       
     and uncork the bottle.     

151
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,759
   this hand-operated machine   
  labels one bottle at a time.  

152
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,163
 the machine removes the backing
     to expose the adhesive,    

153
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,567
     then presses the label     
        onto the bottle.        

154
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,901
    this is a london dry gin,   

155
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:41,506
     meaning it's made with     
   the traditional ingredients  

156
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,976
and contains no added sweeteners
          or colorings.         

157
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,380
    this distillation process   
       is how gin was made      

158
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,550
        before the age of       
 large, commercial distilleries.

159
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,196
   narrator: winchester rifles  
      are known as the guns     

160
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,132
that won the american wild west.

161
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,336
many old guns have quite a past,
          and it shows.         

162
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,738
        dents, scratches,       
        and missing parts       

163
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,341
      make a gun look ready     
        for the junkyard.       

164
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:21,780
  but old guns can be restored  
    lock, stock, and barrel.    

165
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,085
 a vintage firearm may have been
    used in a historic battle   

166
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,020
      or to hunt for food.      

167
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,557
  winchester rifles were one of 
   the first repeating rifles,  

168
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,829
 guns that held multiple rounds 
for a much greater rate of fire.

169
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,665
           to restore           
    a century-old winchester,   

170
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,002
       they disassemble it      
    and evaluate every part.    

171
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,639
    they decide the gun needs   
        a major overhaul,       

172
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,641
            beginning           
    with the shoulder stock.    

173
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,779
  the master gunsmith assesses  
 pieces of american black walnut

174
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,917
         for a new stock        
       and decides on one.      

175
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,187
    he then selects a wooden    
  template of a shoulder stock. 

176
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,993
    he traces the template's    
     contours onto the blank    

177
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,194
     using a grease pencil.     

178
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,465
   he leaves a generous margin  
           for error.           

179
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,604
    he cuts the walnut blank    
        with a band saw,        

180
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,973
  following the pencil profile. 

181
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,747
       these band saw cuts      
       remove excess wood.      

182
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,417
they also give him a basic shape
          to work with.         

183
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,890
next, he clamps the walnut piece
         in a duplicator        

184
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:42,026
    beside the shoulder stock   
            template.           

185
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:53,971
      he follows the shape      
 of the template with a stylus. 

186
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:59,043
  the stylus controls a router  
    that cuts into the wood.    

187
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:05,116
     as he follows the lines    
    of the gunstock template,   

188
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,253
    the router moves in sync    
     to duplicate the shape.    

189
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,124
  it also reveals the beautiful 
   grain of the black walnut.   

190
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:23,201
  the template and walnut copy  
  can be turned simultaneously. 

191
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,907
   this allows the gunsmith to  
cover every angle with a stylus.

192
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,082
    it takes numerous passes    
     to duplicate the shape.    

193
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,488
   next, he brushes black dye   
       onto the receiver,       

194
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,492
          which houses          
  the rifle's operating parts.  

195
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,695
     he slides the receiver     
       into the new stock.      

196
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,632
     the black dye transfers    
 to the high spots of the wood, 

197
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,769
    indicating where the fit    
          is too tight.         

198
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,305
       he scrapes the wood      
       in those locations,      

199
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:04,442
      so the receiver fits      
 more precisely into the stock. 

200
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,445
      this process is known     
          as inletting.         

201
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,317
    he now refines the shape    
      of the shoulder stock     

202
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,719
      using a coarse file.      

203
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,656
 he also evens any rough patches
   created by the duplicator.   

204
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,726
   he switches to a finer file  

205
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:26,264
    as he continues to shape    
    the stock and smooth it.    

206
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:33,271
 finally, he sands the gunstock 
      to a uniform texture.     

207
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:45,015
    he stains both the stock    
        and the fore-end.       

208
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,119
 the fore-end is used to steady 
    the rifle during firing.    

209
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,698
    once the stain has dried,   
    he applies an oil finish.   

210
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,369
   this both protects the wood  
     and enhances the grain.    

211
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,708
       the finish can make      
       all the difference.      

212
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,913
  here, we see finished stocks  
   in low to high-grade wood.   

213
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,953
   next, a craftsman engraves   
       a checkered pattern      

214
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,123
 into the fore-end of the stock.

215
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,332
 he etches a series of grooves, 

216
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,801
       creating an outline      
          to work with.         

217
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,872
 then he carves parallel grooves
      on crisscross angles      

218
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,143
 to form the checkered pattern. 

219
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,812
      this checkering adds      
         visual interest        

220
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,682
       and gives the rifle      
         a better grip.         

221
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,350
       stay tuned for more      

222
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,853
 as this vintage gun restoration
           continues.           

223
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,569
  narrator: restoring old guns  
   was long considered taboo.   

224
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,505
 it was believed that tampering 
      with antique firearms     

225
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,509
   would diminish their value.  

226
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,977
     that view is changing.     

227
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,147
   gun restoration can save it  
       from the junkyard,       

228
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,451
 preserving a piece of the past.

229
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,591
       many old guns have       
       a checkered pattern      

230
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,059
   on the stock and fore-end.   

231
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,664
   to replicate the originals,  

232
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,332
     the gunsmith has etched    
       a checkered pattern      

233
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,867
         into the wood.         

234
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:47,338
  he now darkens the checkered  
sections with black linseed oil.

235
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,541
       the oil highlights       
    and protects the design.    

236
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,681
      the focus then turns      
   to the rifle's metal parts,  

237
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,950
    made of low-carbon steel.   

238
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,820
  after over a century of use,  
    the finish has worn off,    

239
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,223
  compromising their strength.  

240
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,494
       restoration begins       
       with the receiver.       

241
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,496
            it holds            
    the gun's working parts.    

242
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,899
   he files off imperfections.  

243
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,503
 then, he polishes the receiver 

244
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,973
     using an abrasive cloth    
     wrapped around a block.    

245
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:26,177
             he uses            
 progressively finer abrasives. 

246
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,714
          this greatly          
      improves the surface.     

247
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,183
   here is the rifle receiver   

248
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,187
       before it was filed      
          and sanded...         

249
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,923
           and after.           

250
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,894
 he also cleans up the trigger, 
     lever, and other parts.    

251
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:50,134
  after a hardening treatment,  
  the gunsmith applies varnish. 

252
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,737
      the varnish enhances      
       the swirl of colors      

253
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,939
             created            
   by the hardening treatment.  

254
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,208
     this is a classic look.    

255
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,413
   here is the rifle receiver   

256
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,782
     in the different stages    
         of restoration.        

257
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,822
     next, a gunsmith bolts     
    a roll die into a press.    

258
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,428
he then loads the newly polished
   rifle barrel into the press  

259
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,163
        and activates it.       

260
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:24,101
   this press rolls lettering   
         into the metal.        

261
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,305
   this stamped information is  
  known as the barrel address.  

262
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,640
  it includes the company name  

263
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,210
        and original date       
         of manufacture.        

264
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,048
       another team member      
        boils the barrel        

265
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,185
       in hot, soapy water      
  to remove any dirt or grime.  

266
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:50,595
    after a rinse, he slides    
  the barrel onto a fixed rod.  

267
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:57,401
 he wipes off the water residue 

268
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,104
      and heats the barrel      
          with a torch.         

269
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,942
this preheat prepares the barrel

270
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,379
  for a rust-proofing treatment 
       called rust bluing.      

271
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,285
    as he brushes the bluing    
 solution onto the rifle barrel,

272
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,387
   he maintains a steady heat.  

273
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,492
       the hot temperature      
    activates the chemicals,    

274
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,962
and the metal turns a brown hue.

275
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,569
    next, he boils the barrel   
          in hot water.         

276
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:35,906
    its color goes from brown   
        to bluish black.        

277
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,544
   he repeats the rust bluing   
  treatment six to eight times. 

278
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,781
       then, he brushes it      
      against a wire wheel      

279
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,484
  to get rid of excess residue. 

280
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,925
   this century-old gun barrel  
       is as good as new.       

281
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,199
           sometimes,           
  they engrave a gun's receiver 

282
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,735
         with scrollwork        
        or other designs.       

283
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,339
   the engraver cuts the steel  
        entirely by hand.       

284
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,145
        he views his work       
      through a microscope      

285
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,547
   to get every detail right.   

286
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,682
        he also engraves        

287
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,084
     the manufacturer's name    
        and model number        

288
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,253
          into the tang         
     of the rifle receiver.     

289
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,759
 it's delicate work that he has 
  only one chance to get right. 

290
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,761
      elaborate engravings      
      on the rifle receiver     

291
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,432
        aren't necessary,       
    but are a nice addition.    

292
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,206
   the client decides whether   
 to keep it simple or go fancy. 

293
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,245
    restoring a vintage rifle   
          isn't cheap.          

294
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,581
  it costs thousands of dollars 
             or more            

295
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,252
     if expensive engravings    
  and gold inlay work is added. 

296
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,122
  but when it comes to extras,  

297
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,525
 some collectors won't hesitate 
      to pull the trigger.      

298
