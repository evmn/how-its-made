00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,920
narrator: l.e.d. tubes are designed    

4
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,989
so they can easily replace fluorescent tubes    

5
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,325
that are inside overhead commercial light fixtures.    

6
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,195
unlike traditional incandescent and fluorescent lighting,    

7
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,397
a light-emitting diode      

8
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,732
produces light through a microchip.       

9
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,536
it lasts twice as long     
and uses half the electricity.  

10
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,810
these l.e.d. tubes come in a selection of lengths.    

11
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,746
they're designed to be a modern, energy-saving alternative    

12
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,516
to fluorescent tube light fixtures.         

13
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,691
the manufacturing process begins with a printed circuit board.  

14
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,760
"printed" means the board has a network            

15
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:39,365
of conductive copper lines and rectangular paths.      

16
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:43,235
it's designed to electrically link components.  

17
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,238
a technician places the circuit board on a track,  

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,572
which ferries it to       

19
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,642
the first computer-guided machine on the line.       

20
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,445
the machine covers the board with a metal stencil.      

21
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,182
the stencil has openings matching the locations      

22
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,518
where the electronic components will be mounted to the board.  

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,855
the machine spreads a layer of lead-free tin alloy solder  

24
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,058
over the stencil.        

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,060
this applies solder to the board           

26
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,962
only where the components go.  

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,333
the next computer-guided machine on the line           

28
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,136
mounts the first of those components,       

29
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,873
the light emitting diodes, or l.e.d.s.           

30
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,743
they're composed of a microchip coated with a chemical phosphor            

31
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,114
and come in different sizes, colors, and light outputs.    

32
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,686
the factory programs the machine's chip shooter    

33
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,955
to pick the required l.e.d.s off supply reels         

34
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,958
and place them         
on the solder-coated locations  

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,160
on the circuit board.      

36
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,897
the chip shooter works at an astonishing speed,     

37
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:48,534
placing up to 40,000 l.e.d.s per hour.     

38
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,372
a camera trained on the board verifies that          

39
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,575
every l.e.d.'s position is dead-on.           

40
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:01,781
the circuit board moves to a third computer-guided machine             

41
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,716
for the next electronic component,      

42
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,983
the terminals.          

43
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,718
they receive the electric current       

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,522
to power the l.e.d. light tube.              

45
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,192
the machine picks up one terminal at a time      

46
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,561
and places it on the circuit board.      

47
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,335
the circuit board moves into the final machine   

48
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,937
on this line, a tunnel oven.   

49
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:31,210
the temperature inside peaks at about 460 degrees fahrenheit.           

50
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,878
the heat melts the solder,    

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,814
fusing the components to the board.          

52
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,551
solder is both adhesive and conductive.         

53
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,419
the bond connects the components           

54
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,156
to the board's copper electrical network.    

55
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,426
for the high light output tube they're making in this run,   

56
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,295
each board is comprised of eight strips.         

57
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:54,232
each strip has dual rows of l.e.d.s.           

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,069
they snap them into 12-inch strips.       

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,375
the tube length they're making requires four strips.      

60
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,578
a technician slides one with a terminal       

61
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,515
and three without into an aluminum track.     

62
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,784
he gives them a visible inspection,      

63
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,921
then solders the strips to each other.          

64
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,124
once soldered, the strips are electrically bridged     

65
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,528
so the terminal on the first one can power all of them.      

66
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,000
the aluminum track is called the heat sink.     

67
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,669
it's critical to the tube's performance.    

68
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,472
it has deep fins on the bottom which dissipate heat,      

69
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,541
cooling the l.e.d.s.       

70
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,143
this keeps the color of the light consistent     

71
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,013
and extends the tube's life.   

72
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,883
once the technician connects the strips,       

73
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,386
he plugs power into the terminal to test the l.e.d.s.       

74
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,090
next, he inserts wires into the terminal        

75
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,693
and locks them in with a compression tool.   

76
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,064
the opposite ends of the wires           

77
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,368
connect to the power supply in the light fixture.      

78
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,437
the technician snaps a transparent polycarbonate lens              

79
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,240
into grooves on the side of the heat sink.        

80
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:14,113
he closes the tube by placing a cap on each end.  

81
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:18,049
he aligns each cap's pins with slots on the press.     

82
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,985
then the press is activated,   

83
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,320
which forces the caps onto the tube,          

84
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,790
attaching them permanently.   

85
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:25,925
the end with the terminal    

86
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,595
has slots enabling the wires to protrude.      

87
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:33,599
the light tube is finished and ready to be shipped.     

88
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,668
to install this energy-efficient l.e.d. tube,           

89
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,338
simply click the pins on the end caps         

90
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,407
into receiving slots in the light fixture.      

91
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,876
then connect the wires      

92
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,012
to the power supply and the fixture's wiring.    

93
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,615
thanks to those cooling fins on the heat sink,        

94
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:53,551
this l.e.d. tube will last for 100,000 hours   

95
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,188
and has a guaranteed 10-year life-span.        

96
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,372
narrator:            
as any sweet tooth can attest,  

97
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:17,575
there's no end to the flavors you can pair with chocolate.   

98
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,445
a classic combination is milk chocolate        

99
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,648
and peanut butter.        

100
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,316
the saltiness of the peanut butter       

101
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,517
is the perfect foil       

102
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,686
to the sweetness of milk chocolate.        

103
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,258
this bar features a thick layer              

104
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,728
of milk chocolate around a sweet, salty      

105
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,398
and crunchy peanut butter candy center.          

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,535
making that peanut butter candy center is the tricky part.    

107
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,404
to make the candy part of it,  

108
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,474
the factory combines liquid sugar, corn syrup,    

109
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:52,210
coconut oil, and molasses.    

110
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,613
they mix and heat these ingredients        

111
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,282
for about 8 minutes.       

112
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,090
the cooked candy is poured into a large stainless steel bowl.  

113
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,499
next, they add leftovers from the previous batch of candy.   

114
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,171
they call these leftovers "rework"             

115
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:22,041
because they rework them into this new batch.       

116
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,514
once the rework has mixed with the hot, new candy,     

117
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:32,184
they empty the bowl onto a cold stainless steel table.  

118
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,390
they blend the candy       

119
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,527
until the two merge into a sweet, gooey mess.    

120
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,831
once the candy has cooled a bit,              

121
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:52,738
workers fold it up and carry it over to the pulling station.   

122
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
there, they make a pocket in the center          

123
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:58,610
and fill it with vanilla extract.      

124
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,079
they start up the pulling machine,       

125
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,081
which stretches the candy nonstop        

126
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,216
for about 5 minutes.       

127
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,018
this infuses the candy with air               

128
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,354
so that its consistency     

129
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:11,390
resembles taffy rather than hard candy.     

130
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,960
they transfer the candy to a belt            

131
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,230
that carries to it to the weaving machine.     

132
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,572
the machine's rollers flatten the candy        

133
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,042
into a thin sheet.        

134
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,910
then a pump draws        

135
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,712
piping hot peanut butter from this tank...        

136
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,050
and deposits it in a generous layer       

137
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,551
onto the candy sheet.      

138
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,988
workers roll up the sheet    

139
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,491
until it reaches a specific diameter.       

140
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,062
at that point, they fold and place it on a sheet     

141
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,532
without peanut butter, called a blank sheet.      

142
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,068
the next roller presses the folded roll flat       

143
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,669
onto the blank sheet.      

144
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,673
workers roll up the blank sheet,             

145
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,543
sealing the peanut butter candy inside.             

146
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,546
this complex assembly      
is what forms the flaky layers  

147
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,283
in the chocolate bar center.   

148
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,018
workers round the sheet between two rollers       

149
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,821
and feed it to the rope sizer.  

150
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,490
it stretches the peanut butter candy     

151
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:21,026
into a rope that's the exact diameter    

152
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,629
of the chocolate bar center.   

153
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,700
the next machine makes a pinch mark every 5 inches,   

154
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,570
or the length of a chocolate bar.       

155
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,339
the linked centers enter a cooling tunnel.     

156
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,446
they exit 5 minutes later rigid.             

157
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,916
the links separate as they drop to the next conveyor belt.    

158
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,652
they pass through a second refrigerated tunnel,  

159
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,787
which finishes cooling them.   

160
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,924
the centers move into lanes that feed the enrober,      

161
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:55,861
a machine that coats the centers with chocolate.   

162
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,263
workers make sure the centers are single file   

163
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,999
and properly spaced.       

164
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,137
the enrober is like a confectionery car wash.    

165
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,675
centers pass through a hot rinse of milk chocolate first.     

166
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:13,011
then, an overhead dryer blows off any excess,      

167
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,148
leaving behind a 3-milliliter layer of chocolate.       

168
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,254
the bars enter a final cooling tunnel to harden the chocolate.           

169
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,563
workers transfer the finished chocolate peanut butter bars   

170
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,899
to a conveyor belt for packaging.          

171
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,837
as the bars approach the wrapping machine,      

172
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,508
the in-feeder arranges them in single file.         

173
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,843
rolls of printed plastic film unwind       

174
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,113
into the machine's forming box.              

175
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,516
in the blink of an eye, the machine folds, wraps,    

176
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,986
and heat-seals the film around each passing bar.     

177
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,323
a revolving knife slices the wrapper between bars.    

178
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,525
then, it's off to the packaging department,   

179
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,929
where workers pack them 24 to a box.           

180
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,466
these chocolate peanut butter bars   

181
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:10,002
are ready to be devoured by anyone in the mood      

182
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,372
for a crunchy, sweet, and salty chocolate snack.    

183
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,689
narrator: at some pharmacies, robotic systems         

184
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,491
are lending a helping hand behind the counter.       

185
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,427
these machines can do it all.  

186
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,363
they count pills, dispense them into vials,    

187
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,499
cap the vials and label them.  

188
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:43,101
when it comes to handling a heavy workload,        

189
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,371
these robotic dispensers are just what the doctor ordered.  

190
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,777
input the prescription data,   

191
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,448
and this robotic medication dispenser goes to work.     

192
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,584
it counts bottles and labels pills         

193
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,953
in just 30 to 40 seconds.    

194
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,860
making a robot starts with a retainer disk       

195
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,129
for the vial-capping system.   

196
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,933
computerized tools carve slots for the capping mechanism.    

197
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,869
they measure the slots with an electronic probe.    

198
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,275
tools sculpt the rough plastic blank,     

199
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:26,144
transforming it into a platform for the pill vial        

200
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,448
during capping.         

201
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,418
the part takes shape in minutes.            

202
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,754
an assembler installs two computers      

203
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,022
in the dispenser frame.     

204
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:40,292
one computer interfaces with the robotic system.     

205
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:43,828
the other operates the drug inventory.       

206
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,497
she installs a rack       

207
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:49,968
that holds a power strip above the computers.       

208
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,105
she lowers a battery into place beside the computers            

209
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,840
and ties it to the framework.  

210
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,776
this battery provides backup power      

211
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,645
in the event of an outage.    

212
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,517
next come the controls for the robotic arm.       

213
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,454
she inserts them in the frame and plugs them in.        

214
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,190
another member of the team assembles plastic brackets    

215
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,259
to an aluminum manifold.     

216
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,064
these brackets hold plastic cells filled with pills.     

217
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,999
the manifold itself sends dispensing information      

218
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,535
to the cells.          

219
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,270
it also delivers bursts of air  

220
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,138
to move the pills through the cells            

221
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,342
and into prescription vials.   

222
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:35,347
she secures the brackets to the manifold with screws.   

223
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,216
then, she attaches a long row of circuit boards        

224
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,752
to the manifold.         

225
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,021
these circuit boards send data between the cells        

226
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,923
and the dispensing computer.   

227
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,165
she connects ribbon cable    
to the computer circuit board.  

228
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,900
this cable will be linked to 18 other manifolds      

229
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,569
in the dispensing machine.    

230
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,376
they're ready to mount all the manifolds    

231
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,513
to a large metal frame.     

232
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,983
an employee slides the ends of each manifold into slots   

233
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,685
in the rack.           

234
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,257
she stacks up the cell manifolds,       

235
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,693
creating a bank of 18.      

236
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,768
plastic dividers are attached to the brackets.         

237
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,808
this creates compartments    
to hold the actual pill cells.  

238
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,811
the dividers strengthen     

239
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,180
the entire dispensing machine's structure.            

240
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,690
a technician now installs a vertical rail     

241
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,293
that's equipped with a robotic arm.       

242
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,028
he fits the bottom of the rail  

243
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,364
into the grooves of a horizontal track      

244
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:03,167
and attaches the top of the rail to an upper track.        

245
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,070
he connects one end of a long pole,         

246
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,571
called a link shaft,       

247
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,708
to the robot and the other end to the top track.        

248
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,643
this shaft moves the robotic arm horizontally           

249
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,647
to collect pills in a vial.   

250
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,251
the installer tests the shaft to confirm it moves the arm   

251
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,321
along the track with no obstructions.      

252
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:27,726
he programs the robotic arm to move up, down, need around  

253
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,362
in order to collect pills during dispensing.        

254
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,932
he attaches rubber flaps     

255
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,602
to the back of all the pill compartments.  

256
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,404
they absorb the sound of the equipment         

257
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:43,408
to keep the noise level down.  

258
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,678
he connects tanks full     
of compressed air to the grid.  

259
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,414
the compressed air will be pumped through the manifolds   

260
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,818
to move pills through the cells.             

261
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,089
a technician now assembles the exception carousel.     

262
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,357
it captures medications     

263
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,060
that haven't been perfectly dispensed.    

264
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,103
he inserts the motor assembly in the center cavity       

265
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,507
and snaps the top into place.  

266
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,043
he screws a metal framework to the assembly         

267
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,911
and confirms that it revolves freely     

268
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,647
within the framework.      

269
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,518
he scans the serial number for tracking purposes.      

270
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,052
stay tuned for more       

271
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,988
as they prepare this medication dispenser    

272
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,157
for the workplace.        

273
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,939
narrator: a technological revolution    

274
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,276
is happening behind the pharmacy counter.   

275
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,011
robotic systems are proving to be        

276
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,213
fast and accurate pill counters.            

277
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,418
these robotic dispensers bottle and label the medications.    

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,819
in a busy pharmacy,       

279
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,224
these machines         
are a prescription for change.  

280
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:09,494
the carousel that captures any prescriptions        

281
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,631
that are improperly dispensed is now complete.         

282
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:16,167
a technician mounts it to the center of the machine.  

283
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,036
he attaches touch screen controls      

284
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,838
above the carousel.       

285
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,678
it's time to assemble the labeling system       

286
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,580
for the pill vials.       

287
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,582
the first component is the device          

288
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:34,652
that spins the vials as the labels are applied.    

289
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:38,390
she wires it to a motor,    
then places it in the housing.  

290
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,262
she connects a sensor      

291
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,631
that will detect the presence of a vial.     

292
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,871
she attaches the printer to a computer circuit board,   

293
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,840
then tucks the printer into the housing.        

294
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,411
it's time for a test.      

295
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,879
she loads a vial.        

296
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,815
then, the labeler takes it for a spin.       

297
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,618
the system unwinds paper     

298
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,888
and prints the prescribing information.   

299
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,623
little arms wrap the sticky label      

300
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,358
around the spinning vial.    

301
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:19,297
she inspects the label for accuracy and clarity.    

302
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,698
if it meets standards,      

303
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,903
they install the labeler in the medication dispenser.   

304
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:28,373
it's attached to the bottom of the robot's frame.      

305
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,443
the technician mounts two vial storage units  

306
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,245
above the labeler.        

307
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,647
one is for smaller vials,    

308
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,317
and the other is for larger ones.       

309
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,118
mechanical levers inside each unit         

310
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,323
hold vials until they're ready for labeling.       

311
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,659
vials travel down these plastic chutes       

312
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,395
to the printer.         

313
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,664
beside the vial storage and delivery system,       

314
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,165
he installs the capper      

315
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:58,403
that twists the tops onto the vials.         

316
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:04,208
next up are drop-off bins for the completed prescriptions.         

317
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,678
another technician encases the control screen    

318
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,648
and carousel below it with plastic framing.      

319
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,422
he fits an emergency stop button             

320
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,758
to the switch above the control screen.    

321
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,429
to protect the sensitive electronics,    

322
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,365
they attach plastic cabinetry to the front.          

323
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:34,172
a technician now calibrates   
the cells that hold the pills.  

324
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,975
he connects them one at a time to a computer,          

325
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,844
which communicates with the cell network.      

326
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,646
he programs the number of pills to be counted          

327
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,182
and the amount of air pressure needed      

328
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,484
to move them through the throat of the cell.              

329
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,926
after a pill cell is programmed, a technician           

330
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:58,530
places the cell in its slot at the back of the dispenser.  

331
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,068
there are up to 228 uniquely programmed cells.    

332
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,939
they'll hold the pharmacy's most commonly dispensed medications.          

333
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,010
he now scans the bar codes on each cell           

334
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,013
to log the pill inventory.    

335
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,825
the bar code is the serial number for the cell.              

336
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:31,096
this robotic medication dispenser       

337
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:34,365
is ready to be put to the test.              

338
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,900
he loads pill vials       

339
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:40,038
into the storage compartments at the front.          

340
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,439
caps are deposited        

341
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,042
in the compartment beside the vials.        

342
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,049
then, he stocks some of the cells with pills.  

343
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:57,188
for the purpose of this test, the pills are plastic copies.  

344
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,592
sensors in the cells count the pills that are loaded.             

345
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,963
the technician inputs the test prescription.  

346
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,268
a vial drops, and the printer labels it.    

347
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,205
the robotic arm takes the vial to the correct cell.       

348
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:18,075
the robotic arm rotates and slides sideways,       

349
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:22,213
delivering the vial to the capping operation.    

350
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,215
a second robotic arm then presses           

351
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,417
and twists the cap onto the vial.          

352
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,222
the prescription is now filled.             

353
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,758
from labeling to dispensing to capping,    

354
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,528
the process has taken mere seconds.          

355
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:42,166
in the pharmacy, this robotic medication dispenser       

356
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,902
should prove to be indispensable.
