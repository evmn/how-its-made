against rust.                   

447
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,206
now complete, these hydraulic   

448
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,574
cylinders are ready to leave the

449
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,742
factory.                        

450
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,377
they'll soon be under a lot of

pressure to keep machines and   

452
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,814
mechanisms operating.           

453
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,415
but it's the kind of pressure   

454
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,251
they've been made for.
