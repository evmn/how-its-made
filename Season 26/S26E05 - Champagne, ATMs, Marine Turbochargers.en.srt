00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,454
narrator: the word champagne   

4
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:59,325
is often used to describe sparkling white wines.      

5
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:02,328
but true champagne can only come from the champagne region    

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,463
of france.            

7
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,866
it must meet a long list of special requirements     

8
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,068
before receiving the coveted label.        

9
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,610
the champagne industry is heavily regulated.      

10
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,680
the grapes must be locally grown in the champagne region     

11
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:22,481
of france.            

12
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:26,552
they can only use three types of grapes, black pinot noir,   

13
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:27,820
pinot meunier,          

14
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:32,091
or white chardonnay, to produce champagne.      

15
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:34,092
additional rules regulate how the grapes          

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:39,431
can be pruned, picked, pressed, fermented and aged.   

17
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,234
workers harvest the grapes in mid-september.        

18
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,371
they use aerated crates to transfer the crops      

19
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,772
to a grape press.        

20
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,906
they crush the grapes      

21
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,042
and immediately filter the juice.            

22
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,713
the grape skins and pulp can alter the juice's flavor,  

23
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,650
so they have to be removed quickly.             

24
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:03,122
vintage champagne is fermented in old oak barrels.       

25
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,658
they use a sulfur disk to disinfect the barrels     

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,660
between uses.          

27
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,329
first, a worker lights the disk and inserts   

28
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,998
it through a hole on the side.  

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,067
the flame goes out once     
it's sealed inside the barrel.  

30
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,935
the sulfur smoke fills the barrel         

31
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,304
and kills off any bacteria.   

32
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,073
non-vintage champagnes      

33
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,608
are produced in these stainless steel tanks.             

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,612
they start the fermentation process by adding yeast     

35
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,547
to the grape juice.       

36
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,482
in about 10 days, the yeast   

37
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:36,088
turns the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas.     

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,292
the alcohol level of the wine is now about 10 1/2 percent.   

39
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,760
there are no bubbles yet     

40
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:47,233
because the co2 escaped through the top of the tank.   

41
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,435
each fermentation barrel and tank             

42
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:53,305
is labeled based on where the juice inside originated.   

43
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,508
the grape juices from each village have distinctive tastes,             

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,980
caused by differences in soil composition and sun exposure.  

45
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,384
blending begins after the first fermentation.  

46
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:09,455
the winery's experts experiment with different combinations   

47
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:13,459
until they find the taste    
and aroma they're looking for.  

48
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,128
they bottle the mixture with yeast and sugar,      

49
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,664
and place it in a cold, damp cellar for 5 weeks.     

50
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,601
this second fermentation raises the alcohol content    

51
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:26,138
to 12 1/2 percent.        

52
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,339
after fermentation,       

53
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,674
they lie the bottles down horizontally        

54
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:34,613
and let the champagne age for up to 10 years.       

55
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,014
after the aging,         

56
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,018
the bottles go into a machine that freezes the neck.      

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,223
the yeast residue freezes in a small ice cube under the cork.              

58
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:49,094
the carbon dioxide is invented during the second fermentation.          

59
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,830
when workers open each bottle,  

60
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,899
the gas pressure ejects the ice cube.       

61
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,169
this procedure is called disgorging.           

62
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,504
a worker turns the bottle    

63
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:01,707
to minimize the amount of champagne that escapes.    

64
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,645
then he smells it to make sure the champagne hasn't spoiled.  

65
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,380
the winery            

66
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,584
makes a special liqueur out of wine and cane sugar,   

67
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,986
which they add to the champagne.           

68
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,122
the amount of liqueur added brings the champagne to one   

69
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,657
of three sweetness levels,    

70
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,392
known as brut, sec,       

71
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,261
or demi-sec.           

72
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:26,398
the filling machine secures the new cork with a wire cap.  

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,369
the next machine rotate the   
bottles to mix in the liqueur.  

74
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,270
then the bottles go into the cellar        

75
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,673
for at least 3 months.      

76
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,275
after they come out of the cellar,        

77
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,746
the bottles go through an automated washing machine.  

78
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,883
a worker inspects every bottle for floating cork particles   

79
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,620
or flaws in the glass.      

80
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,021
the labeling machine's first station places       

81
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,957
gold foil over the neck.     

82
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,227
the foil label bears the winery's name.     

83
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,230
the second station fires a shot of compressed air        

84
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,399
to mold the foil to the shape of the cork.    

85
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:08,373
the third station glues on the neck label.        

86
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:13,178
it's made of varnished paper.  

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,646
then, the last station      

88
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,251
applies an adhesive label to the front of the bottle.   

89
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,719
a scanner makes sure the foil  

90
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,255
and labels are in the correct place.    

91
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:33,132
this bottle of champagne is finally ready to drink.    

92
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:38,270
when you pop the cork, the gas 
trapped inside gently escapes.  

93
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,406
shaking the bottle just before opening       

94
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,743
will cause an even more dramatic champagne explosion.       

95
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,814
either way, it's the perfect drink to celebrate any occasion.            

96
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,783
cheers.             

97
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,566
narrator: before the automated teller machine,         

98
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,435
withdrawals and deposits were made in person.       

99
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,304
then, in the 1960s,       

100
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,841
simple cash machines started to appear all over europe.    

101
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,977
later, more sophisticated versions were developed.     

102
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,447
today's atms make it easy and convenient   

103
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,918
to bank outside of normal business hours.    

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,387
atms are made of two sections.  

105
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,124
the bottom is a steel safe that houses the cash dispenser.           

106
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:36,595
the head module contains all the user features on top.  

107
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:41,866
most of the atm's non-electronic parts are cut from steel sheets.             

108
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,402
workers load the steel sheets  

109
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,804
into a computer-guided laser cutting machine.      

110
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:50,008
the laser uses focused light to generate intense heat.    

111
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,045
the heat melts the steel to make the cuts.        

112
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,718
the simpler parts are stamped with a die and a press.     

113
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,091
next, a robot loads       

114
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,095
the piece into a fully-automated        
computer-guided bending press.  

115
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,898
the press bends the part into the required shape.     

116
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,844
a computer guided spot welder  

117
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:29,514
fuses the simple parts together at set intervals.    

118
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,116
for more complex parts,     

119
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,454
a computer guided 3-d laser welds the entire joint.     

120
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,994
an automated transport system  

121
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,195
dips the steel parts in a metal primer        

122
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,132
to prevent corrosion.      

123
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:51,669
after dipping,         
they dry the parts in an oven.  

124
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,873
the housing parts are sprayed with liquid or powder paint.   

125
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:01,480
then they go into an oven to bake on the color.      

126
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,751
this is the internal structure for the atm's head module.    

127
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,887
workers assemble all the module's internal components,  

128
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,225
including the power unit and the atm's computer.     

129
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,695
then, they lower the head module onto the atm's steel safe.    

130
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,034
the safe's walls can be up to 2 inches thick.   

131
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,374
there's a separate assembly line for the operation panel.     

132
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:31,376
this panel goes on the front of the head module.       

133
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,779
it contains everything used in an atm transaction,      

134
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,982
from the card reader, to the key pad,         

135
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,650
and even the speaker system.   

136
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,924
the key pad encrypts the user's             
personal identification number  

137
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:50,595
inside the atm.         

138
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,865
the machine has up to three security cameras.    

139
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,803
they record the key pad, the cash tray and the atm user.              

140
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,407
workers connect the monitor to the internal computer.    

141
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,745
they also install the card reader and the receipt slot.   

142
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,280
at the bank's request,      

143
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,483
they can install a separate module for deposits.            

144
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,487
however, this atm uses the cash out slot to accept deposits.   

145
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,294
workers also install the shutter,           

146
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:25,364
a computer-controlled flap on the cash out slot.      

147
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,633
it opens when the machine accepts a deposit        

148
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:32,104
or dispenses money.       

149
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,440
next, workers mount the operation panel    

150
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,576
to the head module.       

151
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,910
on a separate assembly line,   

152
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,380
they prepare the electronic mechanical unit.         

153
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,849
it dispenses the money      

154
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,585
and accepts cash and checks for deposits.     

155
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,327
workers load cassettes into the unit for each cash denomination.          

156
00:09:55,329 --> 00:10:00,132
the bank will separate and stock the cash for their atm.     

157
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,534
before they install the unit in the atm,           

158
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,803
they hook it up to a test computer.       

159
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:08,006
they test a few different transactions with fake bills   

160
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,476
to make sure it dispenses the correct amount.             

161
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,881
if the unit passes testing,   

162
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,517
workers install it in the atm safe.   

163
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,090
they run a couple of the finished machines     

164
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:30,428
through several quality control tests.      

165
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,431
first, a shake test       

166
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:37,235
ensures the atm can withstand  
a bumpy ride during transport.  

167
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,571
next, they conduct a shower test              

168
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:43,441
to ensure that rain won't damage an outdoor atm.   

169
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,310
there's also a climate test.   

170
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,780
they place the atm in a chamber that simulates temperature    

171
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:53,919
ranging from negative 40 degrees to over 120 degrees fahrenheit.           

172
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,521
atms designed for extreme temperatures     

173
00:10:56,523 --> 00:11:00,459
usually have built-in heating or cooling systems.       

174
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:04,530
every atm comes with basic operating software installed.  

175
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,666
the banks then install their custom software  

176
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,069
or have the manufacturer do it for them.         

177
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,218
it takes a powerful engine to move a cruise liner      

178
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,687
or a cargo vessel.        

179
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,156
turbochargers help make it possible.        

180
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,358
they double the diesel engine's output         

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,029
to 100,000 horsepower or more.  

182
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,599
turbochargers also use exhaust gases to run the compressor.   

183
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,304
in a ship's engine,       

184
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,307
the turbocharger is       
a welcome breath of fresh air.  

185
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,777
it's capable of significantly boosting    

186
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,178
the engine's performance.    

187
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,847
it does this by compressing almost 200 feet         

188
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,516
of air per second,        

189
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:00,852
then thrusting that air into the engine's combustion chamber.            

190
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,321
first, they make the turbine wheel.   

191
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,725
it's used to extract the exhaust gases.  

192
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,260
a long cutting tool known as a broach        

193
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,398
carves a tree-shaped pattern around the edge of a steel disk.              

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,866
the pine tree shapes       

195
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,069
are designed to interlock with the matching blades.    

196
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:25,210
next, a computer-guided saw slices a brass alloy       

197
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,546
cylinder into small bearings.  

198
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,282
these bearings will support the turbine shaft.        

199
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,355
they make several bearings in a range            

200
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,191
of sizes and materials for different turbochargers.   

201
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,497
computerized tools mill the surface of the axial bearing.  

202
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,167
they also drill holes to connect the turbine rotor   

203
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,903
and the casing.         

204
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,173
this is the completed bearing.  

205
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,641
a worker inserts one       

206
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,978
of the turbochargers      
nickel alloy blades in a mold.  

207
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,648
he leaves the foot of the blade sticking out.    

208
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,051
he slides the mold directly under a spout,     

209
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,154
which dispenses a hot liquefied tin alloy.       

210
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,794
he fills the mold to the top.  

211
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,730
the tin alloy solidifies, encasing the blade        

212
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,199
just below the foot.       

213
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,668
this structure will fit into a clamping device      

214
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,672
in the grinding operation.    

215
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,475
an employee           
inserts the tin-encased blades  

216
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:36,148
into tensioning devices in the grinding machine.     

217
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,749
inside the tensioning device,  

218
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,886
a clamping mechanism grips the blades.        

219
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,488
as coolant flows,        

220
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,093
a computerized grinder carves grooves in the feet.   

221
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,095
they're specially designed to engage with the tree pattern             

222
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,899
on the turbine disk.       

223
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,368
they pull the tin alloy blocks out of the machine.       

224
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,172
they break the tin alloy,    

225
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:04,709
and remove the blade inside.   

226
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,212
now, it's ready to be connected to the turbine wheel.      

227
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:14,386
a worker slides the blade foot into place on the turbine disk.              

228
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:17,055
then he bends a clip back halfway, with pliers.    

229
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,727
he tightens the alignment with a clamp.          

230
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,734
he hammers the clamp down further,          

231
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,069
until it lays flat against the blade foot      

232
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,605
and turbine wheel.        

233
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,641
this secures the blade to the wheel.          

234
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,080
he continues until the blades are in place.          

235
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,388
it takes 41 blades to complete the job.       

236
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:56,161
next, computerized tools mill the aluminum compressor wheel  

237
00:14:56,163 --> 00:15:00,432
and prepare it for cutting.   

238
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:04,101
the tools carve blades     
and grooves in the compressor.  

239
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,772
the design makes the compressor more aerodynamic.        

240
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,244
an aerodynamic compressor is important           

241
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,947
because it allows more air to reach the ship's engine.   

242
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,522
here's the compressor wheel   

243
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,824
before and after the milling operation.      

244
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,328
next, they run through compressor   

245
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,330
through a safety test.      

246
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:33,865
they lower it into a chamber   

247
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,735
and spin it a lot faster than it would normally operate.    

248
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,073
they confirm that the compressor can withstand a speed      

249
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,577
of 27,000 revolutions per minute without breaking.   

250
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:55,020
next, the compressor wheel receives an ultrasonic cleaning.            

251
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,689
high frequency sound waves ripple through the water     

252
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,157
to scrub off any grease     

253
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,494
and contaminants.        

254
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,931
a worker uses a blower to start drying the compressor wheel.   

255
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,438
then, he lowers it into a dryer to get rid            

256
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,042
of any residual moisture.    

257
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,243
when we return,         

258
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:21,179
this marine turbocharger will become seaworthy.      

259
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,248
stay tuned.           

260
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,534
narrator: turbochargers deliver fresh air        

261
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,403
to big ship engines.       

262
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,138
this enhances their combustion  

263
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,808
and adds to their mechanical might.    

264
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,676
turbochargers help        

265
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,546
make these diesel engines among the most powerful in the world,             

266
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,948
allowing them to move gigantic vessels         

267
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,650
swiftly through the water.    

268
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,755
a technician shines an ultraviolet light   

269
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,225
onto the surface of the compressor wheel.     

270
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,160
this illuminates any fine cracks             

271
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,364
that could compromise its quality.           

272
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,968
if no cracks are found, they start assembling the rotor.             

273
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,172
the employee slides bearings onto the main shaft and turbine.            

274
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,440
he uses a crane         

275
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,642
to align the center hole of the compressor wheel     

276
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,980
with the shaft.         

277
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,816
he guides it into place and fits it to the bearing.   

278
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,192
then he screws a cone-shaped cap onto the end.          

279
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,395
the turbine wheel is connected to one end of the shaft,     

280
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,198
and the compressor is connected to the other.    

281
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,270
the core parts of this turbocharger are now assembled.           

282
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,906
a technician locks the rotor in a balancing machine.     

283
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,546
when he activates the machine, the rotor starts spinning.    

284
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,950
sensors detect the speed     

285
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,687
and the angular position of the rotor.          

286
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:12,891
they also check for any possible imbalances.   

287
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,560
the team uses this information to shave down the rotor     

288
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,928
and bring it into balance.    

289
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:25,970
then, the final assembly of the turbocharger begins.   

290
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,873
the team screws the iron casing to the gas outlet.        

291
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,612
they attach three bearings to it.              

292
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,189
this insert is called the labyrinth cover.       

293
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,926
it will act as a seal for the turbine disk and shaft.             

294
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:50,929
the long bolts fit into holes in the bearing casing.      

295
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,134
he moves to the other side,   

296
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,671
and secures the protruding bolts and nuts.            

297
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,946
he removes the compressor wheel             
temporarily to slide the shaft  

298
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,014
through the center bearing.   

299
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:14,618
the turbine wheel fits perfectly over the labyrinth cover.    

300
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,820
on the other side,        

301
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:20,357
he bolts the labyrinth disk to the casing.          

302
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,028
the labyrinth disk protects against hot turbine exhaust gas               

303
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,797
and prevents oil leakage.    

304
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,038
then, he re-installs the compressor wheel.      

305
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,981
meanwhile, an employee      

306
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,919
wraps rock wool insulation around the gas inlet casing.   

307
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,654
it's made of cast iron      

308
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,324
and built to withstand gases as               
hot as 900 degrees fahrenheit.  

309
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,933
they cover the part with a heat-resistant fabric jacket.             

310
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:06,404
then it's ready to be mounted to the gas outlet casing.    

311
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:10,341
workers use a crane to move it into position.    

312
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,611
they align the holes in the part with the threads in the casing.             

313
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,613
then they bolt it into place.  

314
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:28,226
they install a cast iron casing around the compressor wheel   

315
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,662
and secure it with numerous nuts and bolts.         

316
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,971
they hoist an insert part into place            

317
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,309
between the compressor wheel and the casing.         

318
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,445
air will flow between the insert and the compressor        

319
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:52,784
before traveling to the engine for combustion.         

320
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:56,654
the turbocharger is now ready to               
be installed in a ship engine.  

321
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,258
this is done in the factory's assembly hall.              

322
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,726
once in place,          

323
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,629
they fire up the engine and test its performance.    

324
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:13,337
they evaluate how much power the turbocharger adds to the engine.             

325
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,740
they also assess the turbocharger's impact    

326
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,009
on fuel efficiency.       

327
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,045
this turbocharger meets expectations.       

328
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:29,954
some cars and trucks use small turbochargers in their engines,            

329
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,023
but these behemoths should   
deliver twice the air pressure  

330
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,292
of those models,         

331
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,094
so the ship's captain will have all the power     

332
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,563
he needs to navigate the high seas.
