00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,824
           narrator:            
  today on "how it's made"...   

2
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:27,493
     fire extinguishers...      

3
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,065
        ...doughnuts...         

4
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,071
     ...shock absorbers...      

5
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:44,877
        ...and banjos.          

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,387
  the first fire extinguisher   
           on record            

7
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,856
      was built in europe       
      in the middle ages.       

8
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:02,595
 it worked like a giant syringe 
that squirted water at a fire.  

9
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:06,131
  the modern extinguisher uses  
compressed air as a propellant  

10
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,534
    and douses the fire with    
     flame-retardant liquid,    
            powder,             

11
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,770
           or foam.             

12
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,475
      squeezing the lever       
         opens a valve          

13
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,944
 that releases compressed air.  

14
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:21,614
   the pressure then propels    
 the chemical through the hose  

15
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:22,882
      and out the nozzle.       

16
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:24,617
    production of the release   
             valve              

17
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,287
 starts with cylindrical pieces 
  of aluminum called blanks.    

18
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:33,359
    a carousel runs each one    
             through            
     16 different machining     
           stations.            

19
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,428
         at each stop,          
 under a shower of lubricant,   

20
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,632
     tools shape the blank      
      for 6 1/2 seconds.        

21
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,169
         as each blank          
    completes the circuit,      

22
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,173
  it comes off the carousel.    

23
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:50,843
      from blank to valve       
  in a minute and a quarter.    

24
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,383
  now the fire extinguisher's   
        aluminum handle         

25
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,052
  is riveted onto the valve.    

26
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,624
      it pivots on a pin.       

27
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:11,197
    next, an aluminum lever     
  is riveted onto the handle.   

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,333
 this is the lever you squeeze  
 to use the fire extinguisher.  

29
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,472
  then comes the valve stem --  
  the valve's inner workings.   

30
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,274
     workers simply place it    
            inside,             

31
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:26,045
        and an automated        
    assembly machine does the   
             rest.              

32
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,682
     it positions a spring      
         over the stem          

33
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,619
      to create resistance      
  when you squeeze the lever.   

34
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,490
     then comes a retainer      

35
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,494
    to hold both the stem and   
             spring             
         in position.           

36
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,032
      now workers slip on       
       a plastic thimble        

37
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:49,368
   to position the rubber "o"   
              ring              
      that goes on next.        

38
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,772
  the "o" ring acts as a seal   
between the valve and cylinder  

39
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,373
     so nothing leaks out.      

40
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,444
 the siphon tube runs from the  
 valve down into the cylinder.  

41
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:01,313
   the firefighting chemical    
      goes up this tube,        

42
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,581
     then out the nozzle.       

43
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,050
       the compressed air       
      inside the cylinder       

44
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,786
 is what propels the chemical.  

45
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:09,588
        this gauge shows        
if there's sufficient pressure  

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,789
      for that to happen.       

47
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,058
         after coating          
   the gauge's threaded stem    

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,994
with sealant to prevent leaks,  

49
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,263
       a worker screws it       
        onto the valve.         

50
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,399
     the valve unit is now      
   fully assembled, tested,     

51
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,736
   and ready for installation   
    on top of the cylinder.     

52
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,942
   to attach it, the cylinder   
              needs             
      a threaded collar.        

53
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,512
   with the help of a press,    
    a worker positions it.      

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,086
    the cylinder also needs     
           a bottom.            

55
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,824
   the technique this factory   
              uses              
 to fuse the bottom and collar  

56
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:45,891
      is called brazing.        

57
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,760
   it's similar to soldering    

58
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,896
     but with a copper ring     
      as a bonding metal.       

59
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,032
   after positioning a brazing  
              ring              

60
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,568
          at the base           
     of the open cylinder,      

61
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,771
         a steel bottom         
    is pressed into place.      

62
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,475
     then workers position      
     a brazing ring over the    
            collar.             

63
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,715
   now into a brazing furnace   
  for an hour and 45 minutes.   

64
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,785
     the 2,000-degree heat      
  melts the two copper rings,   

65
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,887
boding the parts they connect.  

66
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,529
           next stop,           
    the static-paint booth,     

67
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,465
      where workers apply       
 a positive electrical charge   

68
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,933
    to the paint particles      

69
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,535
     and a negative charge      
       to the cylinders.        

70
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,272
      this draws the paint      
   onto the surface evenly.     

71
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:37,376
   then it's into an oven for   
 45 minutes to bake the paint.  

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,148
    once the cylinders cool,    
automated machinery fills them  

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,751
   with a fire-extinguishing    
            powder.             

74
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,954
      the main ingredient       
     is a form of ammonia.      

75
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,623
 when it's sprayed on a fire,   

76
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,158
  the heat melts the particles  
          of powder,            

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,493
        fusing them into        
  an oxygen-blocking blanket    

78
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,496
   that smothers the flames.    

79
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,502
     after the cylinders are    
             filled,            
     an automated machine       

80
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,105
         screws a valve         
 onto the collar of each one.   

81
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,511
  now it's time to pressurize   
         the cylinder.          

82
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,047
     the lever is squeezed      
      to open the valve,        

83
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,384
     enabling a compressor      
to fill the cylinder with air.  

84
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,987
  they keep filling until the   
 air pressure reaches 13 bars,  

85
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,723
  about six times the pressure  
        in a car tire.          

86
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,992
     next, workers screw on     
          the nozzle            

87
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,593
  and install a locking pin.    

88
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,396
  this immobilizes the lever    

89
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,566
      so the extinguisher       
 can't discharge accidentally.  

90
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:37,269
   as the instruction sticker   
              says,             
       in case of fire,         

91
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,938
  you just pull the pin, aim,   
          and spray.            

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,542
 this mounting bracket lets you 
  hang the fire extinguisher    

93
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,246
 in an accessible spot so it's  
 close at hand if you need it.  

94
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:55,888
 when we return, frying up one  
 of america's favorite treats.  

95
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,699
      narrator: doughnuts       
 used to be called oily cakes   

96
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,168
  because they were deep fried  
         in pork fat.           

97
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,104
   when dutch pilgrims first    
   brought them to america,     

98
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,571
    they were ball-shaped.      

99
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,974
    but then someone found      

100
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,376
  that removing a nut of dough  
        from the center         

101
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,378
        helped them cook        
       far more evenly.         

102
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,814
 and so the doughnut was born.  

103
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,389
   in the world of doughnuts,   
 there are two basic types --   

104
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,058
        yeast doughnuts         
      and cake doughnuts.       

105
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:39,464
 the batter for cake doughnuts  
     drops from the mixer       

106
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,333
           right into           
    boiling vegetable oil.      

107
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,603
  the nozzles shape the dough   
         as it passes.          

108
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,806
       the doughnuts fry        
for about a minute and a half.  

109
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,042
  then a conveyor carries them  
    out of the vat to cool.     

110
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,748
        yeast doughnuts         
  require more time to make.    

111
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,485
       a high-speed mixer       
    works the yeast dough,      

112
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,721
    then workers pull it off    
    the machine into bins.      

113
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:11,764
          from there,           
     it goes into a hopper      

114
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,500
    that extrudes the dough     
          as a sheet.           

115
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,705
          then it's on          
   to another conveyor belt     

116
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,374
   where a series of rollers    
    flatten the dough sheet     

117
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,276
 to just 3/4 of an inch thick.  

118
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:42,528
    the sheet passes under a    
             shower             
        of cinnamon...          

119
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,199
 then hits a rotating cylinder  
   that rolls it into a log.    

120
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:51,870
  a small metal rod sprinkles   
     the dough with water.      

121
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,073
  this keeps it sticky enough   
       to hold its shape        

122
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,142
       while going under        
  another flattening roller.    

123
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,218
    a dusting of cornstarch     
 keeps the dough from sticking  

124
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,188
 to the blade that now cuts it  
         into pieces.           

125
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,763
  a retractable arm drops the   
blocks of dough four at a time  

126
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,666
     onto wire-mesh trays.      

127
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,504
 then it's off to the proofer,  

128
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,839
      a machine much like       
       a large bread box        

129
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,909
   in which heat and humidity   
  help the yeast dough rise.    

130
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,179
     this leavening process     
    takes about 20 minutes,     

131
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,582
 during which time the trays -- 
      over 300 of them --       

132
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,953
         go up and down         
  and then out to the fryer.    

133
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,791
   a gate slows the doughnuts   
              down              
     just before the drop       

134
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,128
        so they slide in        
  without splashing hot oil.    

135
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,599
    gas burners keep the oil    
      at a constant boil.       

136
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,136
      anything less and the     
            doughnuts           
  would come out partly raw.    

137
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:59,805
   halfway through, they get a  
              flip              

138
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,141
     so they'll cook evenly     
          throughout.           

139
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,013
       after two minutes,       
 the doughnuts leave the fryer  

140
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,349
   and move through a curtain   
        of sweet glaze.         

141
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,289
      a strong air current      
     blows off the excess.      

142
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,492
      and these fry cakes       
       are ready to eat.        

143
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,760
      they gradually cool       

144
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,296
     as they spiral through     
      the production area       

145
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,964
  on their way to packaging.    

146
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,972
  now let's see how they make   
    doughnuts with filling.     

147
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:38,443
    a machine separates the     
yeast dough into little blobs,  

148
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,313
    then sends them rolling     
     down plastic tunnels.      

149
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,318
     this shapes them first     
          into pucks,           

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,187
 then into round dough balls.   

151
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,529
rollers then flatten the balls  

152
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,865
 before they enter the proofer  
           to rise.             

153
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:03,335
  there's cornstarch everywhere 
               to               
     prevent the dough from     
            sticking            

154
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,737
        to the machinery        
   or to the conveyor belt.     

155
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:11,209
   row after row of doughnuts   
       fry in hot oil...        

156
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,345
  then slide into a large drum  
   that tumbles them around,    

157
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,348
         covering them          
    with a sugary coating.      

158
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:24,756
      now it's time for the     
            doughnuts           
        to get filled.          

159
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,293
      these nozzles inject      
    just the right amount of    
             jelly.             

160
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,929
          each worker           
 fills 45 doughnuts a minute.   

161
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,176
      after filling, these      
           doughnuts,           
      known as bismarcks,       

162
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,112
      are ready to go on to     
           packaging.           

163
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,781
  they're just one of the many  
      delicious varieties       

164
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,918
  that this factory turns out   
       on a daily basis.        

165
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,662
   next, the shocking truth     

166
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,099
    behind one of your car's    
     most critical parts.       

167
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,943
  narrator: shock absorbers do  
   more than just smooth your   
             ride.              

168
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,212
   they counteract the bounce   
     when you hit a bump,       

169
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,413
    holding your tires to the   
             road.              

170
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,083
     without that traction,     
    you could lose control.     

171
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:29,154
   so by affecting steering,    
   stopping, and stability,     

172
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,291
      shocks are actually       
   a vital safety component.    

173
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,632
    wheel vibrations cause a    
             piston             
   inside the shock absorber    

174
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,834
 to force oil through a valve.  

175
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,305
      this absorbs energy,      
reducing the vehicle's bounce.  

176
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:49,374
    all this happens within     
   the shock's two tubes --     

177
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,578
  the reserve tube and, inside  
               it,              
      the pressure tube,        

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,580
     housing the piston rod     
    and compression valve.      

179
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,116
      both of these tubes       

180
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,253
  are made from a steel sheet   
      sliced into strips.       

181
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,790
    inside this tube mill,      

182
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,525
  coolant prevents the passing  
    strip from overheating      

183
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,594
     as one forming roller      
         after another          

184
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,964
   gradually rounds it into a   
             tube.              

185
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:18,270
  then, a copper welding wheel  
    fuses the tube closed.      

186
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:21,606
    as the 6-yard-long tube     
      comes off the mill,       

187
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,476
    a cutting tool chops it     
 into shock-absorber lengths.   

188
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,947
    the tube-making process     
          is the same           

189
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,083
        for the reserve         
      and pressure tubes,       

190
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,219
 except that the reserve tubes  
   undergo one extra step --    

191
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,355
     compressing the ends.      

192
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,624
     this enables the shock     
to house a larger reserve tube  

193
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,760
    that can hold more oil.     

194
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,829
 the reserve tube's final stop  
          is a press.           

195
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,632
          a die inside          
    stamps the part number,     

196
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,435
    the manufacturing date,     
      and the brand name.       

197
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,238
    many components are made    
     of powdered metal --       

198
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,375
 mostly iron powder mixed with  
   some graphite and copper.    

199
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,978
     after a press compacts     
     the powder in a die,       

200
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,913
a furnace fuses the particles.  

201
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,316
    this powdered-metal part    
         is the valve           

202
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,785
    through which the piston    
        forces the oil.         

203
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,055
    steel discs and a spring    
    help control the speed      

204
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,792
 with which the valve operates  
       for varying driving      
          conditions.           

205
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,261
        a stamping tool         
  crimps the end of the tube,   

206
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,063
      holding the spring in     
           position.            

207
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,868
      the valve, now fully      
           assembled,           

208
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,470
        seals the bottom        
     of the pressure tube.      

209
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,475
   meanwhile, a press punches   
       round steel discs        

210
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,077
    into other components.      

211
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,883
     these loops mount the      
shock absorber to the vehicle.  

212
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,686
    a worker positions a cup    
         on each one,           

213
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,822
          then a robot          
     welds them together.       

214
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,832
   they insert a cup-and-mount  
              unit              
    on one end of the reserve   
             tube,              

215
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,435
       then weld it on.         

216
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,072
      this unit is called       
      the base assembly.        

217
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,049
      the base assemblies       
     now go on a conveyor,      

218
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,051
  open end up so that workers   

219
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,654
    can drop a pressure tube    
       inside each one.         

220
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,726
  automated injectors now fill  
      the tubes with oil        

221
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,796
   that's specially designed    
  to maintain its consistency   

222
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,065
       despite changes in       
          temperature.          

223
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,069
 next comes the head assembly,  

224
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,606
         which includes         
     the steel piston rod       

225
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,143
 and the mount on the other end 
    of the shock absorber.      

226
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,546
   two copper welding wheels    
    fuse the head assembly      

227
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,882
   to the base assembly with a  
              cap.              

228
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,219
     this closes the unit,      
    sealing the oil inside.     

229
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:51,289
     next, workers weld on      
       a dirt shield --         

230
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,691
         a steel casing         
      that prevents dirt        

231
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,361
  from hindering the movement   
      of the piston rod.        

232
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,571
    a piece called a bushing    
  is pressed into each mount.   

233
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,373
      this helps tone down      
        the vibrations          

234
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,908
   coming from the vehicle.     

235
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,380
          now it's on           
   to an automated carousel.    

236
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,784
  robots pierce a hole in each  
 shock and inject nitrogen gas  

237
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,087
   to prevent the oil inside    
         from foaming.          

238
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,058
        after injection,        
   the robot seals the hole     

239
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,660
   by welding on a tiny steel   
             ball.              

240
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,532
            and now             
  for the finishing touch --    

241
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,534
  an electrostatic paint job.   

242
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:38,069
         a machine runs         
 a positive electrical current  

243
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,604
      through the shocks        

244
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,673
       and a negative one       
 through the paint particles.   

245
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,476
         like a magnet,         
    the static electricity      

246
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:49,014
    draws the paint onto the    
             shocks             
      in a flawless coat.       

247
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,482
        in the factory's        
     quality-control lab,       

248
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,885
        technicians use         
    sophisticated equipment     

249
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,822
  to evaluate how well a shock  
       dampens movement         

250
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,090
     at different speeds.       

251
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:03,628
       the tube-and-valve       
          configuration         
   inside varies by vehicle,    

252
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,164
         so the shocks          
on a ground-hugging sports car  

253
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,834
      are quite different       
 from those on a luxury sedan   

254
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,769
     or on a light truck.       

255
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,707
 coming up, a production line   

256
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,143
    that comes with strings     
           attached.            

257
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,118
           narrator:            
    the twang of the banjo      

258
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,322
     resonates in american      
 country music and bluegrass,   

259
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,257
   but this down-home sound     

260
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,459
     actually has its roots     
          in africa.            

261
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,061
   slaves brought to america    
       wanted something         

262
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,931
       that sounded like        
  the instruments from home,    

263
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,866
  so they devised the banjo.    

264
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,603
and the rest is music history.

266
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,083
        to make a banjo,        
   a lip is carved into wood    

267
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,953
      that's been steamed       
 and bent into a circular rim.  

268
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,556
the rim is carefully measured.  

269
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,059
    it must be a perfect fit    
   for this metal tone ring.    

270
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:16,234
  the wooden back of the banjo  
  acts as a sound resonator,    

271
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,704
 and some plastic trim gives it 
     a more stylish look.       

272
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,514
     a chemical accelerator     
      helps the glue dry        

273
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,784
  so the plastic trim adheres   
       almost instantly.        

274
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,124
  the surface is then sanded    

275
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,928
   until the plastic is flush   
         to the wood.           

276
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,034
    this long piece of wood     
 will become the banjo's neck.  

277
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:56,808
 using a table saw, an artisan  
cuts a long slot into the neck  

278
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,912
 so that a metal adjusting rod  
    can be installed later.     

279
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,819
 he widens the end of the neck  
    with two pieces of wood     

280
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,955
    to form the instrument's    
           peg head.            

281
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,626
           next comes           
   some very delicate work,     

282
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,962
    as tiny mother-of-pearl

283
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,665
          are embedded          
     in a piece of ebony.       

284
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,970
  that inlaid piece of ebony    

285
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:29,140
 is then glued onto the banjo's 
 peg head and clamped to dry.   

286
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,515
     now it's over to a saw     
        with 22 blades.         

287
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,685
     a long piece of ebony      
  is passed over those blades   

288
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,320
    to make the banjo's fret    
             slots.             

289
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,922
       this is the banjo's      
          fingerboard.          

290
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,593
     once it's been adorned     
 with more inlaid decorations,  

291
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,730
    the fingerboard is glued    
     onto the banjo neck.       

292
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,733
        next, the edges         
of the banjo neck and peg head  

293
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,168
   are trimmed down to size.    

294
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,341
       using this router,       
    artisans give the back      

295
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,412
  and sides of the banjo neck   
      smoother contours.        

296
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,085
  the rounded edges will make   
 the instrument easier to hold  

297
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,453
           and play.            

298
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,425
    they finalize the shape     
   of the neck with a rasp,     

299
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,293
     then give it a thorough    
            sanding.            

300
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,034
 here, metal frets are tapped   

301
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,303
         into the slots         
      on the fingerboard,       

302
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,605
  and the overlap is trimmed.   

303
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,310
         now it's time          
      for a little color.       

304
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,280
        stain is rubbed         
     onto the banjo parts.      

305
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,185
     when the stain dries,      

306
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:51,523
   it's followed by 12 coats    
         of lacquer...          

307
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,459
     and finally, a thorough    
            buffing.            

308
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,799
       now all the pieces       
        come together,          

309
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,403
 beginning with the pre-fitted  
   tone ring and wooden rim.    

310
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:09,273
 the plastic head through which 
the banjo's sound will radiate  

311
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,476
    fits on the tone ring.      

312
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:14,212
      the head is secured       
      with a tension hoop       

313
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,613
    and a series of hooks.      

314
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,819
     tightening these hooks     
 will stretch the plastic head  

315
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,887
   to adjust the instrument's   
             tone.              

316
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,360
   the banjo neck and its peg   
              head              
         are attached           

317
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,563
 and secured with metal rods.   

318
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,236
  the tuning pegs are screwed   
      into the peg head.        

319
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,240
    then the banjo's strings    
  are attached and tightened.   

320
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,784
   this little wooden bridge    
   sits on the plastic head     

321
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,954
   and is only held in place    
by the tension of the strings.  

322
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,395
 finally, the back of the banjo 
       goes into place.         

323
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,998
  and now this finely crafted   
          instrument            

324
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
    is ready to strum away.
