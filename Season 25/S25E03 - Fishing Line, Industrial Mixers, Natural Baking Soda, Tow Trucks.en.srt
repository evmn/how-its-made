00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,091
           narrator:            
  today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:59,058
 early fishing lines were made  
      of vines and braided      
           horsehair.           

5
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,861
      but today, fishermen      
  rely on braided synthetics    

6
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,330
    to reel in their catch.     

7
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,732
 with a higher tensile strength 
          than steel,           

8
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,803
   these lines are unlikely to  
              snap              
  when they hook the big one.   

9
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,809
this fishing line may be thin,  

10
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:20,479
     but that doesn't mean      
       it's not strong.         

11
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,748
    it's made of a synthetic    
             called             

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,552
  ultra-high-molecular-weight   
         polyethylene.          

13
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:30,088
  this same synthetic is used   
  in milk jugs, water pipes,    

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,925
  and even bulletproof vests.   

15
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,095
 to make these fishing lines,   

16
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:40,633
    numerous microfibers are    
             braided            
  into a single, tight cord.    

17
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:45,304
      an employee starts by     
            threading           
    fibers through needles.     

18
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:49,841
     she pulls the needles      
through spring-loaded devices.  

19
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,777
  the devices keep the fibers   

20
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,615
   at an even tension as they   
  unwind onto small bobbins.    

21
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,690
   these bobbins are designed   
     to fit in the braiding     
           machines.            

22
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,264
    the machines are called     
       maypole braiders         

23
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:16,102
    because the spools spin     
like dancers around a maypole.  

24
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,739
         as they spin,          

25
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,542
     they weave the strands     
      into a tight braid.       

26
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,280
        there are 4,500         
braiding machines in operation  

27
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,049
       at this factory.         

28
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,089
    producing a tight braid     
         is slow work.          

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
    it takes about 10 days      

30
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,530
 to braid a 7,500-foot section  
       of fishing line.         

31
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,173
      big spools overhead       

32
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:58,077
   slowly revolve to take up    
the braided polyethylene line.  

33
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,983
       at the same time,        

34
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:09,321
  a worker fills a metal tank   
       with hot water...        

35
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,157
  and adds yellow dye to it.    

36
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,060
   a pump at the bottom of the  
              tank              

37
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,464
     keeps the water moving     
 to evenly distribute the dye.  

38
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,570
    he stirs it a bit while     
  he inspects the mixing job.   

39
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,009
  they heat and pressurize the  
              dye               

40
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,144
           in a tank            
   filled with fishing line.    

41
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:36,282
 the dye penetrates all of the  
 strands for an even dye job.   

42
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,955
      these fishing lines       
     go through a different     
            process.            

43
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,891
          they unwind           
     through metal eyelets      

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,694
          into a tray           
   of yellow silicone resin.    

45
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:54,032
  this proprietary resin makes  
 the line abrasion-resistant.   

46
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,102
    it will be less likely to   
              break             
  if dragged across a surface   

47
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,105
         like a rock.           

48
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,708
         next, the line         
    travels through an oven     

49
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,244
      to cure the resin.        

50
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,646
    it travels over a series    
     of tensioning rollers      

51
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,181
         as it exits.           

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,520
         then, the line         
    goes through an abrasive    
            eyelet,             

53
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,056
         which removes          
    external contaminants.      

54
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,061
    finally, it's rolled up     
          by a spool.           

55
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,000
     now it's over to a test    
            station.            

56
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,202
  a technician clamps a piece   
        of fishing line         

57
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,937
    in a testing apparatus.     

58
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,275
   it pulls the fishing line    
     from both ends until it    
            breaks.             

59
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,780
        a gauge measures        
  the line's breaking point.    

60
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,752
     it snaps at 118 pounds     
         of pressure,           

61
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,587
    exceeding requirements.     

62
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,965
      with the test piece       
   of fishing line approved,    

63
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,367
      an automated system       

64
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,637
     now transfers the line     
    to retail-sized spools.     

65
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:11,043
    it loads about 450 feet     
    of line onto each one.      

66
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,051
    a worker applies a label    
     with product details       

67
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,887
        and packages it         
      in a cardboard box.       

68
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,326
     it takes about 17 days     
       to braid, color,         

69
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:31,197
   and process a single spool   
  of synthetic fishing line.    

70
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,868
     strong but very thin,      

71
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,872
         it can be cast         
   and reeled in with ease.     

72
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,613
   if the fish take the bait,   
              they              
 may not be able to get away.   

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,697
   narrator: the applications   
  for industrial-grade mixers   

74
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,299
        are limitless.          

75
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,434
      from construction and     
           recycling            

76
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,037
       to food processing       
     and medical supplies,      

77
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,240
 mixers chop, crush, and blend  

78
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:17,576
        any combination         
   of dry and wet materials     

79
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,046
         into a variety         
   of products or compounds.    

80
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,384
  this mixer consists of a bin  
       called a u-trough        

81
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,520
       and an agitator.         

82
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,522
        it's controlled         
    by an interface module      

83
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:34,059
       with simple start        
       and stop buttons.        

84
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,396
       the agitator shaft       
    is the main component.      

85
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,264
   its arms and paddles turn    
          at a speed            

86
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,667
     of 10 to 50 rotations      
          per minute.           

87
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,804
       a discharge valve        
    underneath the u-trough     

88
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,240
     controls the unloading     
        of the mixture.         

89
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:56,482
    first, a hydraulic 40-ton   
              press             
    roll-forms a carbon steel   
             sheet.             

90
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,486
 the sheet rolls back and forth 
        under the press         

91
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,388
  until it takes a "u" shape.   

92
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,428
    an overhead crane brings    
    the sheet over to the end   
             plate              

93
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,163
         for welding.           

94
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,636
 a worker spot-welds the sheet  
       to the end plate.        

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,574
   then, he makes a continuous  
              weld              
       on the end plate         

96
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,210
        along the inside        
   and outside of the sheet.    

97
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,516
    a high-definition plasma    
  cutter burns paddle shapes    

98
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,585
 into a stainless-steel plate.  

99
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,120
the extreme heat of the plasma  

100
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,922
 cuts right through the steel,  

101
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,860
   making very precise lines    
          and angles.           

102
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:45,264
       then, the paddles        
    go to a forming press.      

103
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:49,301
       the 150-ton press        
   pushes the plate down on a   
              die.              

104
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,871
  steel is a formable metal,    

105
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:57,275
         so it can bend         
 without cracking or breaking.  

106
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,277
       a slight curvature       
        in the paddles          

107
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,014
   will maximize the lifting    
      and scooping effect       

108
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,215
       of the agitator.         

109
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,219
 a machinist turns the agitator 
          main shaft.           

110
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,956
      it takes a very hard      
    and resistant material      

111
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,858
           to machine           
  such a massive steel shaft.   

112
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,562
  this tungsten carbide insert  
 can resist high temperatures   

113
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,632
          and maintain          
     a sharp cutting edge.      

114
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:24,235
         the machinist          
    measures the diameter.      

115
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,238
 he cuts a groove into the end  
         of the shaft           

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,908
     using a stagger-tooth      
       side-mill cutter.        

117
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,577
this groove, called a keyseat,  

118
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,912
          is designed           
     to lock the agitator       

119
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,382
 to the mixer's drive gearbox.  

120
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,586
   machining of the agitator    
  requires extreme precision.   

121
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:45,390
       the shaft must fit       
    into the drive gearbox      

122
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,626
 and match its drive key slot.  

123
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,265
    a worker assembles arms     
   and paddles to an agitator   
             shaft              

124
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,134
  mounted inside a u-trough.    

125
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,507
       he bolts the arms        
        onto the shaft.         

126
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,947
      he tightens the nuts      
with a pneumatic torque driver  

127
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,383
     and assembles paddles      
         to the arms.           

128
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,156
        both the paddles        
     and arms are angled.       

129
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,526
  machine slots in the paddles  
  allow clearance adjustment.   

130
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,434
     next, a worker rotates     
 the assembled shaft and arms   

131
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,767
    to check the clearance      

132
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,504
      between the paddles       
      and u-trough walls.       

133
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,444
    a welder creates a solid    
stainless-steel agitator shaft  

134
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,113
      for a larger mixer.       

135
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,051
 he welds the base of the arms  
         to the shaft           

136
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,187
        and grinds down         
      the welding profile       

137
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,256
  to obtain a uniform shape.    

138
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,325
   welded agitators are often   
              used              
      in food processing        

139
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,063
          because they          
     make cleaning easier.      

140
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,466
     now, workers attach an     
            electric            
      motor to the mixer.       

141
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,869
 they mount the drive assembly  
    on the agitator shaft.      

142
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:09,007
    a taper bushing centers     
    the drive gearbox on the    
             shaft.             

143
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,077
  fasteners secure the bushing  
           in place,            

144
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,280
      locking the agitator      
     shaft into the drive.      

145
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,283
   a worker installs a safety   
              grate             
      on top of the mixer       

146
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,119
    and closes the covers.      

147
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,358
       then, he installs        
   air-pressure regulators.     

148
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,229
        these supply air        
   to the main shaft seals.     

149
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:34,600
    air purge seals prevent     
product loss or contamination.  

150
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,238
       air lines connect        
    the pressure regulators     

151
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,142
          to both ends          
  of the main shaft agitator.   

152
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,447
  the mixer fits on a support   
     frame for easy access      

153
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,282
    to the discharge valve.     

154
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,719
         it's equipped          
 with clamps, safety latches,   

155
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,988
     and a control panel,       

156
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,592
         which includes         
   an emergency stop button.    

157
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,474
     narrator: baking soda      
is a white crystalline powder.  

158
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,943
     when added to dough,       

159
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:21,346
   it reacts with the acidic    
 ingredients to form bubbles,   

160
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,283
    giving cakes and cookies    
 a light and fluffy structure.  

161
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,552
         it's also used         
      in livestock feed,        

162
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,455
      fire extinguishers,       
        and detergents.         

163
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,763
   baking soda is also known    
    as sodium bicarbonate.      

164
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,366
       it can be produced       
  through a chemical process,   

165
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,769
       or it can be mined       
       from the ground.         

166
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:50,242
     large mineral deposits     
 exist in northwest colorado,   

167
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:54,980
      left behind as lakes      
           evaporated           
    millions of years ago.      

168
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,915
         mine operators         
       dissolve the sodium      
          bicarbonate           

169
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,452
 underground using hot brine.   

170
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,188
       the brine is a mix       
   of the minerals and water    

171
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,591
      left over from prior      
          processing.           

172
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,461
           they pipe            
the higher-concentration brine  

173
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,431
    to a processing facility    
      about a mile away.        

174
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:17,402
       the brine collects       
   in a holding tank outside    

175
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,505
    and flows through pipes     
 into the facility as needed.   

176
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,546
      inside, a technician      
       tests the liquid         

177
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,450
 and confirms that the level of 
      sodium bicarbonate is     
           adequate.            

178
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,157
        then, the brine         
 flows through several tanks,   

179
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,927
     where heat exchangers      
      gradually cool it.        

180
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,798
          this causes           
 the sodium-bicarbonate brine   

181
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,069
     to crystallize, making     
     the granules larger and    
            heavier.            

182
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,640
       the crystals sink        
    to the bottom of the last   
             tank.              

183
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,711
      this forms a mixture      
    of brine and crystals.      

184
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:04,515
  they pump this mixture into   
 a device called a hydroclone.  

185
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,853
    the hydroclone spins out    
 the brine through the center.  

186
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,855
     the crystals gravitate     
         to the sides           

187
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:13,057
    and sink to the bottom.     

188
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,528
          this creates          
 a sodium-bicarbonate slurry.   

189
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,064
     it has a meringue-like     
         consistency.           

190
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,304
 the slurry is about 40% sodium 
  bicarbonate at this point.    

191
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,542
     a lot of water has been    
            removed,            

192
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,644
       but there's still        
       work to be done.         

193
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,348
 as the dewatering continues,   

194
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,684
     the system recaptures      
         spent liquid           

195
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:44,489
   and pipes it back into the   
              mine              
  to dissolve more minerals.    

196
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,427
  the slurry goes for another   
      spin, this time in a      
          centrifuge.           

197
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,963
   it wrings out more water,    

198
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,600
    transforming the slurry     
    into something called wet   
             cake.              

199
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:01,039
          wet cake is           
    95% sodium bicarbonate.     

200
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,648
   next, the wet cake travels   
          to a mixer            

201
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,951
     that blends dry sodium     
  bicarbonate powder into it.   

202
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,890
     the dry powder brings      
  the moisture content down to  
              3%.               

203
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,932
   next, the wet cake makes a   
              quick             
    trip through this dryer     

204
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,533
           to remove            
    the remaining moisture,     

205
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,535
   leaving pure baking soda.    

206
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,273
      the baking soda now       

207
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,276
   shakes through three tiers   
     of vibrating screens.      

208
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,280
   the crystals are sorted by   
             size,              

209
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,616
           producing            
   several different grades.    

210
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,722
     from brine to powder,      
  it's been quite a journey.    

211
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,294
    it's time to determine      

212
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,431
    how this naturally mined    
   baking soda measures up.     

213
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,837
  a technician dissolves some   
 of the baking soda in water.   

214
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,707
 he adds an acid to neutralize  
    the sodium bicarbonate.     

215
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,411
        this allows him         
    to measure its purity.      

216
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,916
  he also places the different  
     grades of baking soda      

217
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,053
    in a screening device.      

218
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,590
    it vibrates to shake the    
granules through perforations,  

219
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,461
   verifying that the crystals  
              have              
been correctly graded by size.  

220
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,067
   with the lab's approval,     

221
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,237
        this baking soda        
 is ready for the marketplace.  

222
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,474
a robotic arm picks up the bag  

223
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:46,244
   and transfers it to a fill   
  station with a scale below.   

224
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,814
       the scale signals        

225
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,817
     when there's 55 pounds     
   of baking soda in a bag,     

226
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,821
   prompting the fill nozzle    
         to shut off.           

227
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:01,226
   these 55-pound bags will be  
              sold              
    to commercial bakeries      

228
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:06,564
  and companies that use large  
 amounts of baking soda daily.  

229
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,835
        it will no doubt        
     rise to the occasion.      

230
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,717
  narrator: when an 18-wheeler  
        has an accident         

231
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:29,320
   or construction equipment    
         breaks down,           

232
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:34,659
   you need to call in the big  
              guns              
  to haul it away for repair.   

233
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,462
 large tow trucks are equipped  
    with specialized tools      

234
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,699
           to recover           
      and transport massive     
           vehicles.            

235
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,738
         this tow truck         
      can haul a vehicle        

236
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,273
   as large as a semitruck.     

237
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,943
      the towing apparatus      
   is called the underlift.     

238
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,546
       this is one of four      
          outriggers.           

239
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,681
      these legs stabilize      
         the tow truck          

240
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,151
         when the using         
      the recovery boom.        

241
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:04,355
     this extendible boom is    
            equipped            
with dual-wire ropes and hooks  

242
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,192
     to retrieve a vehicle      
   that's gone off the road.    

243
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,430
  these hydraulically powered   
 towing and recovery machines   

244
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:16,500
   are made up of 2,500 parts   
    cut from steel sheets.      

245
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,836
       the parts are cut        
      by one of two types       

246
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,838
of computer-guided machines --  

247
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,773
   a high-pressure water-jet    
            cutter,             

248
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,109
     as we're seeing here,      

249
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,744
      or a laser cutter.        

250
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:33,918
   workers position the parts   
   in an assembly fixture...    

251
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,254
 then tack-weld them together.  

252
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,462
   tack welding is an initial   
   welding in select spots,     

253
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,263
     just to hold the parts     
           together             

254
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,667
         until a robot          
    does the final welding.     

255
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:06,518
         next, workers          
      sandblast the welded      
           component.           

256
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,556
     this preps the surface     
         for painting.          

257
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:18,829
      they apply one coat       
      of epoxy primer...        

258
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,233
 then one coat of polyurethane  
       automotive paint.        

259
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,703
        the paint dries         
      in about two hours        

260
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,839
        and fully cures         
      in about two days.        

261
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,576
   workers hook up all of the   
      hydraulically powered     
           components           

262
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,446
   to this testing machine.     

263
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,715
         if everything          
      functions properly,       

264
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,719
   workers connect permanent    
       hydraulic lines.         

265
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,656
to assemble the recovery boom,  

266
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:49,660
     they install hydraulic     
            cylinders           
that will move it up and down,  

267
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:54,199
 a winch that winds and unwinds 
     the thick wire ropes,      

268
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,800
   and an enormous ring gear    

269
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,504
     that enables the boom      
    to rotate 360 degrees.      

270
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,078
             then,              
   they attach the extendible   
             boom.              

271
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,521
          it's secured          
   with massive steel pins.     

272
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,230
     workers also attach he     
            underlift           
          at the back           

273
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:30,568
    and the four stabilizing    
    outriggers underneath.      

274
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,371
   this completes the towing    
      and recovery unit.        

275
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,307
       now they attach it       
     to a prebuilt truck.       

276
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,577
     steel mounting plates      
    are bolted to the truck's   
             frame.             

277
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,348
  the towing-and-recovery unit  
     is then welded to those    
            plates.             

278
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,586
   workers bolt aluminum tool   
           cabinets             

279
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,755
          to the side           
     of the truck's frame.      

280
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,401
      inside the cabinet,       
      they make the wiring      
          connections           

281
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,805
    for the emergency lights    
      and other electrical      
          components.           

282
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,881
  they install the electronic   
         control panel          

283
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,417
      that the driver uses      
    to operate everything.      

284
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,820
   the control panel monitors   
       oil temperature,         

285
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:25,890
      hydraulic pressure,       
       and other important      
          indicators.           

286
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,159
    they also install a set     
      of control handles        

287
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:32,263
       to give the driver       
      the option of manual      
           operation.           

288
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:40,038
 once everything is hooked up,  

289
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,807
     they perform a quality     
      control inspection.       

290
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,254
          this factory          
     makes several models,      

291
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,490
   ranging from a light-duty    
         tow truck...           

292
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,997
 ...to one like this, designed  
  to haul the heaviest trucks   

293
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,465
        and machinery.
