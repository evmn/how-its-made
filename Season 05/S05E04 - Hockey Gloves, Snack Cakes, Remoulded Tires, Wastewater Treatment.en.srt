00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,158
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,128
        hockey gloves...        

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,265
        ...snack cakes...       

4
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,139
      ...remolded tires...      

5
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,510
  ...and wastewater treatment.  

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
           ice hockey           
      can get pretty rough,     

7
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,523
 so wearing the proper equipment
           is a must.           

8
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,326
      hockey gloves protect     
  the forearm, wrist, and hand. 

9
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,262
    a good glove has padding    
    in all the right places,    

10
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,698
    but is still lightweight    
        and comfortable.        

11
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,333
   it also has to be flexible,  

12
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,837
     so the player can hold     
 and maneuver the hockey stick. 

13
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,408
      the covering material     
        of a hockey glove       

14
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,211
   is called the outer shell.   

15
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,681
    it can be made of genuine   
  leather or synthetic leather. 

16
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,817
       there's even a new       
synthetic material called carbon

17
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,152
        that's tearproof,       

18
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,822
   even if a sharp skate blade  
           slashes it.          

19
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:34,025
      what it's made of is      
 a closely guarded trade secret.

20
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,295
   one hockey glove is made up  
  of about 30 different parts,  

21
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,697
     depending on the model.    

22
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:42,033
        workers lay a die       
    in the shape of each part   

23
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,035
  on the outer-shell material.  

24
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,972
a hydraulic press forces it down
      like a cookie cutter.     

25
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,442
  workers then cut foam pieces  
       to line the glove.       

26
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,046
 this low-density foam is stiff 
  enough to provide protection, 

27
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,915
       but flexible enough      
      to enable the player      

28
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,184
   to grip the stick properly.  

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,321
  a seamstress now lockstitches 
         the outer-shell        

30
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,323
 and foam-lining parts together,

31
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,526
     assembling each section    
    of the glove separately.    

32
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,795
         after finishing        
      the back of the hand,     

33
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,798
      called the back roll,     
 she pieces together the thumb. 

34
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,934
  she sews three sides closed.  

35
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,669
       one end stays open       

36
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,673
  so they'll be able to insert  
 more protective foam afterward.

37
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,676
  these are the finger pieces.  

38
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,811
         the seamstress         
     uses a tacking machine     

39
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,548
  to sew up the sides and tack  
 the corners for added strength,

40
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,752
     again leaving one end,     
         the top, open.         

41
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,098
  now they assemble the fingers 
    to the base of the glove.   

42
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:50,102
     they use what's called     
     a cylinder arm machine.    

43
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,038
 it has a narrow sewing surface 
         that protrudes,        

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,674
    making it easy to access    
         the fingertips.        

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,119
next come the parts that make up
    the palm and the gusset,    

46
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,189
   the piece that goes between  
    the fingers and the palm.   

47
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,859
    like before, workers cut    
     the parts using a die.     

48
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,194
       the palm and gusset      

49
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,730
     can be made of high-end    
   synthetic suede or leather   

50
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,066
    or even genuine leather.    

51
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,269
  the advantage of real leather 
    is that it can be treated   

52
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,205
  with an antibacterial product 
        that combats odor       

53
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,042
   caused by the hand sweating  
        inside the glove.       

54
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,950
   again, the seamstress uses   
    the cylinder arm machine    

55
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,351
         to sew the palm        
       to the glove base,       

56
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,589
        which already has       
      the fingers attached.     

57
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,560
         next, the glove        
       goes onto a machine      

58
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,897
       that's custom-made       
 for the hockey-glove industry. 

59
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,366
       using air pressure       
       to power a piston,       

60
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,502
        it injects pieces       
  of high-density foam padding  

61
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,971
        into the open end       
         of the fingers.        

62
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,507
 high-density foam is rock-hard,

63
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,978
         so it provides         
       maximum protection.      

64
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,656
    but high-density foam is    
 too stiff to go into the thumb,

65
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,658
  which needs some flexibility. 

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,528
  so instead, they make what's  
 called an armored thumb plate, 

67
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,598
      which is essentially      
     a plastic thumb shield.    

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,068
       a hot forge presses      
  a flat piece of hard plastic  

69
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,405
      onto an aluminum mold     
   in the shape of the plate.   

70
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,946
    then they wrap the plate    
       in low-density foam      

71
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,882
    and, with another machine   
  custom-made for this purpose, 

72
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,585
 inject it into the glove thumb.

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,894
   the lower part of the glove  
        is now complete.        

74
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,630
    a seamstress finishes off   
   the edge with cotton tape.   

75
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,901
    all that's left is to do    
is assemble and attach the cuff.

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,305
        the standard cuff       
 is a little over 2 inches wide.

77
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,640
     you can buy the gloves     

78
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,109
      this company produces     
       for retail stores,       

79
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,710
   or order customized gloves   

80
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,180
   with your name embroidered   
          on the cuffs.         

81
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,717
   professional hockey players  
  have the factory build gloves 

82
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,518
   to their own specifications  

83
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,921
      with extra protection     
          in key areas          

84
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,389
     or certain adjustments     

85
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,526
    that they feel give them    
    an advantage on the ice.    

86
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,731
     the most important part    
    of the glove is the palm.   

87
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,200
  that's the area that endures  
     the most wear and tear.    

88
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,138
 the sturdier the palm material,
 the longer the glove will last.

89
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,875
 but at the same time, the palm 
   padding can't be too thick.  

90
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,878
    that would make the glove   
      uncomfortable to wear     

91
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,315
 and take away the player's feel
      for the hockey stick.     

92
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,159
 narrator: when marie antoinette
   said, "let them eat cake,"   

93
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,562
    she probably didn't mean    
     those mini jelly logs.     

94
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,698
       still, in the realm      
 of treats for the sweet tooth, 

95
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:11,035
           snack cakes          
    have been revolutionary.    

96
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,172
   they're just the right size  
        for a quick snack       

97
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,008
    and individually wrapped    
         to stay fresh.         

98
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,649
 veteran snackers will recognize
      this as a jelly log,      

99
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,653
a sponge cake rolled up with jam
      and a creamy filling.     

100
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,523
     first the factory bakes    
        the sponge cake.        

101
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,460
    it comes out of the oven    
      in continuous strips.     

102
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:39,598
   those moving arms align the  
 strips to receive the fillings.

103
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,800
  one machine then does it all. 

104
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,470
 first it deposits an even layer
       of cream filling...      

105
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,407
  then blobs of strawberry jam. 

106
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,012
     now the rolling begins.    

107
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,015
   one side of the cake strip   
   runs against a metal guide.  

108
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,419
           this lifts           
    and folds over the edge.    

109
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,288
      then the cake strips      
   run against a second guide   

110
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,925
 which rolls it over some more. 

111
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,363
      now the machine cuts      
      the continuous strip      

112
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,698
      into separate cakes.      

113
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,535
    then an automated roller    
       completes the logs.      

114
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,922
         the jelly logs         
     go onto a conveyor belt    

115
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,858
       that positions them      
        closer together,        

116
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,627
        aligning them for       
 the next phases of production. 

117
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:47,899
 they travel through a waterfall
  of strawberry-flavored syrup. 

118
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,669
       this sticky coating      
      acts as a tasty glue      

119
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,673
 to adhere the shredded coconut 
     that showers them next.    

120
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,676
        the conveyor belt       
      shakes off the excess     

121
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,212
     which, like the excess     
    strawberry syrup before,    

122
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,414
            gets fed            
   through the machine again.   

123
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,285
  now, if all this doesn't have 
 your sweet tooth tingling yet, 

124
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,021
    the next snack cake will.   

125
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:15,093
   it's a chocolate cream cake  
 covered in a chocolate coating.

126
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,095
 production begins in the mixer,
    where they combine eggs,    

127
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,165
   a vegetable-oil mixture...   

128
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,499
            flour...            

129
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,101
            sugar...            

130
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,437
            water...            

131
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,374
 glucose, a liquid sweetener... 

132
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,976
        and cocoa powder.       

133
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,047
the mixer blends the ingredients
  at high speed for one minute. 

134
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,649
    then it pumps the batter    

135
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,118
      into a machine called     
    the automated depositor,    

136
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,053
    which squirts the batter    
        into cake molds.        

137
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,194
  the conveyor belt transports  
   the mold pans to the oven.   

138
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,530
        the batter bakes        
         for 7 minutes.         

139
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,000
           to achieve           
     just the right texture,    

140
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,736
     there's a very specific    
        heating pattern.        

141
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,071
  once the pans exit the oven,  

142
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:04,609
 a robot flips the cakes upside 
   down onto a conveyor belt.   

143
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,348
  it stacks the empty mold pans 
      onto another conveyor     

144
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,017
      that sends them back      
        for more batter.        

145
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:17,622
now the cakes flip right side up
   onto a wire conveyor belt.   

146
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,559
     air circulating between    
   the wires cools the cakes.   

147
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,362
        the next machine        
  aligns the cakes in position  

148
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,531
       for the next phases      
         of production.         

149
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:33,438
        first thin blades       
     saw the cakes in half.     

150
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,243
       then suction tubes       
         remove the tops        

151
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,980
         and place them         
      next to the bottoms.      

152
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,054
     next the machine drops     
   a portion of cream filling   

153
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,521
         on each bottom.        

154
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,259
       the cream is about       
  the consistency of margarine. 

155
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,595
       as the feeder tube       
  above each cake delivers it,  

156
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,534
a wire cutter slices off a piece
   about 1/4 of an inch thick.  

157
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,837
     then the suction tubes     
      put the tops back on.     

158
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,079
          now the cakes         
      pass through a shower     

159
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,282
             of hot,            
   chocolate-flavored liquid.   

160
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,952
  this coats the top and sides. 

161
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,087
        at the same time,       

162
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,291
        the cakes travel        
  through a bath of the liquid. 

163
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,160
    this coats the underside.   

164
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:33,665
  air jets blow off the excess. 

165
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,970
         the cakes pass         
    through a cooling tunnel.   

166
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,706
          this hardens          
 the chocolate-flavored coating.

167
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:45,643
          then it's off         
  to the packaging department.  

168
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,980
   the cakes file into a sheet  
     of polypropylene film.     

169
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,850
  the machine seals, then cuts  
   the film between each cake.  

170
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,120
    this keeps each one fresh   
        until snack time.       

171
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:06,263
 narrator: if you need new tires
      for your car or truck     

172
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,998
 and are looking to save money, 

173
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:12,203
    you might consider buying   
  retreaded or remolded tires.  

174
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,205
   retreads are worn-out tires  

175
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,809
  onto which the factory glues  
       new rubber treads.       

176
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,846
   remolds, on the other hand,  
      are actually rebuilt.     

177
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,153
    this company specializes    

178
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,956
          in remolding          
     commercial truck tires.    

179
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,026
        the worn-out tire       
       is called a casing.      

180
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,162
    this is a cross section.    

181
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,031
  that steel reinforcement rod, 
        called the bead,        

182
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,766
       won't be replaced.       

183
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,502
     but most of the rubber     
       around it will be,       

184
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,904
         along with most        
       of the tread area.       

185
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,973
         the steel belts        
    underneath the treads --    

186
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,843
   those dots -- will remain.   

187
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,512
           they begin           
      the remolding process     

188
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,380
    by thoroughly inspecting    
           the casing           

189
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,850
          to determine          
whether it's indeed salvageable.

190
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,453
     they consider its age,     
    whether it's had repairs.   

191
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,988
          they examine          
      the steel components      

192
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,257
          to make sure          
      they haven't rusted.      

193
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,292
if the casing passes inspection,

194
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,995
           it moves on          
     to the buffing machine.    

195
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,898
       there, sharp blades      
     spinning at high speed     

196
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,668
         shear off most         
  of the worn-out rubber tread. 

197
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,871
  buffing prepares the surface  
     so that the new rubber     

198
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,207
        will adhere well        
 and stand up to road friction. 

199
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,477
          buffing takes         
    about 6 minutes per tire.   

200
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:30,715
   it leaves just over 1/16 of  
 an inch of tread on the casing.

201
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,486
       now they use a tool      
         called a skiver        

202
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:38,756
 to shave off any imperfections.

203
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,692
          a rubber tire         
   is like a car windshield --  

204
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,028
     even the smallest crack    
       can spread outward,      

205
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,165
    so it has to be stemmed.    

206
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,500
  after excising problem spots, 

207
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,637
        they smooth them        
     with a grinding stone.     

208
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,708
        then they repeat        

209
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,843
  the buffing-skiving-grinding  
            procedure           

210
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,444
   on the sides of the casing,  

211
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,448
          but they use          
 a less abrasive grinding stone 

212
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,118
  because the sides don't need  
   such aggressive treatment.   

213
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,586
     unlike the tread area,     

214
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,055
     they won't be subjected    
        to road abrasion.       

215
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,391
       now, using a drill,      

216
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:18,196
  workers remove dirt and rust  
         from each spot.        

217
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,265
     then they work the area    
some more with a grinding wheel,

218
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,734
       so that the rubber       
     they'll use to patch it    

219
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,271
      will adhere properly.     

220
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:30,475
  now they glue the patch from  
 the inside with rubber cement, 

221
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,544
  pressing out any air bubbles  
          with a roller         

222
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,047
     to ensure full contact.    

223
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,152
      workers can now start     
      rebuilding the tire.      

224
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,956
  they feed a rubber strip into 
  a machine called an extruder. 

225
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,892
  first it heats up the strip,  
      making it malleable.      

226
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,427
        then it wraps it        
        onto the casing,        

227
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,898
      building up anywhere      
     from two to four layers    

228
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,168
   depending on how thick the   
 customer wants the tire to be. 

229
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,304
          that depends          
      on several factors --     

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,708
 for instance, how much traction
     the tire needs to have     

231
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,377
      and whether the truck     
   will be doing mostly local   

232
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,880
    or long-distance driving.   

233
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,586
     now they apply a wider     
   rubber strip to the sides,   

234
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,055
building up one to three layers,

235
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:22,660
  the choice again depending on 
 the customer's thickness needs.

236
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:26,730
   using a perforating roller,  
  they release the trapped air. 

237
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,535
     this enables the layers    
         to adhere well.        

238
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,539
   now they sprinkle the tire   
       with rubber powder,      

239
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,607
    residue from the buffing.   

240
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,644
   this will prevent the tire   
   from sticking to the mold.   

241
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,413
  the mold consists of sections 

242
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,750
     which allows it to open    
wide enough to receive the tire.

243
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,419
  the backward lettering inside 
          will imprint          

244
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,322
     the remolding company's    
     brand name on the tire.    

245
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,766
        the mold applies        
  about 220 pounds of pressure  

246
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,571
       as well as heat --       
     320 degrees fahrenheit.    

247
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,774
    this fuses the molecules    
in the old and the new rubber --

248
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:14,045
       a chemical reaction      
     called polymerization.     

249
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,782
      once the mold closes      
     to begin this process,     

250
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,652
    a tube inflates with air    
       and fills the void.      

251
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,386
 this provides counterpressure, 

252
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,589
        so that the tire        
      doesn't get crushed.      

253
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,267
          molding time          
    is anywhere from an hour    

254
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,536
    to an hour and 15 minutes   
            per tire,           

255
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,271
   depending on the thickness.  

256
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,874
   after extracting the tire,   

257
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,877
    workers remove the seams    
        of excess rubber        

258
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,612
      with a special comb.      

259
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:52,683
       this remolded tire       
  is now ready to hit the road  

260
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,618
  at considerable cost savings. 

261
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,754
 depending on the size and type,

262
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,592
 a remold is 30% to 60% cheaper 
        than a new tire.        

263
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,903
narrator: have you ever wondered
  where all the rainwater goes, 

264
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,371
   or the snow once it melts,   

265
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,041
 or the water in your sink, tub,
and toilet after you've used it?

266
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,311
  this wastewater flows through 
  the underground sewer system  

267
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,712
      to a treatment plant.     

268
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,115
        the plant removes       
     most of the pollutants,    

269
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,585
     then releases the water    
      into a lake or river.     

270
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,858
  the underground sewer network 

271
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
           feeds into           
     a regional interceptor,    

272
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,728
which is a kind of sewer highway

273
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,997
            that runs           
     to the treatment plant.    

274
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:44,068
        the action begins       
 at the plant's pumping station.

275
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,137
    it doesn't look like much   
           from above,          

276
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,407
    but the building extends    
  some 15 stories belowground,  

277
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,877
    right through solid rock.   

278
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:03,087
     the wastewater collects    
   in huge underground wells.   

279
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,223
    it's not a pretty sight.    

280
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,892
   it's full of dirt, garbage,  
        and fecal matter.       

281
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:11,496
  it also contains high levels  
         of phosphorus,         

282
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,031
       a poisonous element      
     in the nitrogen family     

283
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,366
      harmful to waterways      

284
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,302
       because it promotes      
    the overgrowth of algae.    

285
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,512
         the water flows        
  from the wells to giant pumps 

286
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,715
  that force it to the surface. 

287
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,522
 the plant has backup generators

288
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,390
    to keep the pumps working   
      in case of a blackout     

289
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,127
  and devices to prevent water  
         from backing up        

290
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,197
    should a pump have to be    
    shut down for servicing.    

291
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,269
       once the wastewater      
      reaches the surface,      

292
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,204
            it flows            
   through the pumping station  

293
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,274
 down discharge channels leading
   to the treatment building.   

294
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,211
   along the way, it's sprayed  
  with either aluminum sulfate  

295
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:04,482
       or ferric chloride,      
    two chemical coagulants.    

296
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,552
    they gradually transform    
     phosphorus in the water    

297
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,055
      from liquid to solid      
 so it can be removed later on. 

298
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,960
     once the water reaches     
     the treatment building,    

299
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,628
    it flows through screens.   

300
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,164
   this preliminary filtration  

301
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,901
    removes any solids larger   
  than one inch in diameter --  

302
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,371
     such things as stones,     
       paper, and plastic.      

303
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,583
          giant presses         
      compact this garbage,     

304
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,585
 squeezing out the excess water.

305
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,388
  trucks then haul the stuff to 
 a landfill, where it's buried. 

306
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,457
   the wastewater, meanwhile,   

307
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,194
     flows into large tanks     
      called grit chambers.     

308
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,197
    grit refers to particles    
   in the water such as gravel  

309
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:57,268
   that are inorganic, meaning  
  they don't decompose or burn. 

310
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,737
  these particles, some as tiny 
       as a grain of sand,      

311
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,474
 gradually settle to the bottom.

312
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,476
     then they're pumped out    
  and trucked to the landfill.  

313
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,014
  to remove organic particles,  
       mainly phosphorus,       

314
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,217
       they add a polymer,      
  a type of chemical compound.  

315
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,620
       this demonstration       
       shows what happens.      

316
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,556
   remember, as the wastewater  
    left the pumping station,   

317
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,225
 it was sprayed with coagulant. 

318
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,694
        that transformed        
   the phosphorus in the water  

319
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,896
      into solid particles.     

320
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,899
      the polymer solution      
     completes the process.     

321
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,969
    it binds those particles,   
forming what are called "flocs,"

322
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,706
      masses of phosphorus      
   that look like snowflakes.   

323
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,744
   they're heavier than water,  
   so they sink to the bottom.  

324
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,382
 and that's exactly what occurs 

325
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,116
         in the plant's         
        clarifier tanks.        

326
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:50,454
it takes about two hours for the
 flocs to settle at the bottom, 

327
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:54,425
   forming a layer of sediment  
        called "sludge."        

328
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,930
   a system of rakes and pumps  
       collects the sludge      

329
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,933
       and transfers it to      
 the sludge treatment building. 

330
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,470
   unless testing shows a need  
    for additional treatment,   

331
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,606
         the clarified,         
    fully treated wastewater    

332
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,808
   now flows to what's called   
          the outfall,          

333
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:15,880
      a series of channels      
 that discharge into the river. 

334
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,882
     in the sludge-treatment    
            building,           

335
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,084
    they spray the wet sludge   
  with another type of polymer. 

336
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,221
   this further solidifies it,  

337
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:28,025
 so that filter presses can more
  easily squeeze out the water. 

338
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,496
  most of the sludge goes into  
giant incinerators to be burned.

339
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,765
   the ashes go to a landfill.  

340
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:41,972
  the gas that the incinerators 
  emit powers several machines  

341
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,643
   that dry and transform the   
 remaining sludge into pellets. 

342
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,714
     these pellets are sold     
     as organic fertilizer.     

343
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,783
  when it arrived at the plant, 

344
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,652
         the wastewater         
    was full of contaminants    

345
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,454
     that harm aquatic life.    

346
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,322
      now, after treatment,     

347
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:03,126
 it contains 80% fewer suspended
   solids such as fecal matter  

348
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,196
    and 75% less phosphorus.
