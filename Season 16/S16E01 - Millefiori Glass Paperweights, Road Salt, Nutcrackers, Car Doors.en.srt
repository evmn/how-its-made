00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,652
            narrator:           
     "millefiori" is italian    

2
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,187
    for "a thousand flowers."   

3
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,923
     it's also an elaborate     
     glass-making technique     

4
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,859
 developed in 15th-century italy

5
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,594
    in which pattern-colored    
       glass rods are cut,      

6
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,530
 grouped to form floral shapes, 

7
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,866
            arranged            
    into intricate patterns,    

8
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,868
 then encased in clear crystal. 

9
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:14,540
      if a picture's worth      
        a thousand words,       

10
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,942
      these thousand-flower     
          paperweights          

11
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,277
      speak for themselves.     

12
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,881
   two canadian artists craft   
  these millefiori masterpieces 

13
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,884
   just as the renowned glass   
  makers of murano, italy, did  

14
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,285
         centuries ago.         

15
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,755
  a mix containing silica sand, 
       soda ash, and lime       

16
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,692
            is heated           
  to 2,400 degrees fahrenheit,  

17
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:35,694
           melting it           
 into lead-free liquid crystal. 

18
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,496
   with a molten-crystal post,  

19
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:41,701
          they pick up          
 a densely colored bar of glass.

20
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:44,704
       they roll and shape      
       the white color bar      

21
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,807
   while stabilizing the post   
        with cold water.        

22
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,977
       then with a torch,       

23
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,648
  they preheat an aluminum mold 
   of a flower or other motif.  

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,318
 preheating the mold helps the  
 glass flow into it more easily 

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,722
      and assume the shape      
       in greater detail.       

26
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,659
       once they've molded      
       the colored glass,       

27
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,462
   they return to the furnace   
 to encase it in molten crystal.

28
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,932
    then they repeatedly heat   
      and shape the crystal     

29
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:16,268
    with tools and with steam   
    on a wad of wet newspaper   

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,871
    until the crystal encases   
 the flower-shaped color evenly.

31
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,140
        after reheating,        

32
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:24,477
  they put some molten crystal  
    on the end of another rod   

33
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,479
      and grab the free end     
  of the crystal-encased color. 

34
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,549
 they wait until the glass cools
   to a specific consistency.   

35
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,885
    then they begin to pull.    

36
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,155
  they slowly stretch the glass 
    into a thin and even rod,   

37
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,756
    careful not to twist it,    

38
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,225
      as that would distort     
        the flower shape        

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,961
  of the colored glass inside.  

40
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:45,297
   this produces what's called  
        a murrini cane --       

41
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,902
    a clear crystal rod with    
a colored, flower-shaped center.

42
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,637
  once the murrini solidifies,  

43
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,039
           they nip it          
    into manageable lengths.    

44
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,375
     then they take murrini     
of different colors and designs,

45
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,911
    cut them into short rods,   

46
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,448
 and bundle them into a pattern 
    called a complex murrini.   

47
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,317
they preheat the complex murrini
            in a kiln           

48
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,653
           to prevent           
     shock-induced cracking.    

49
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,255
       they now pick it up      
     with a hot crystal post    

50
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,658
       and, after removing      
       the bundling wires,      

51
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,795
     heat and work the group    
     of glass rods into one.    

52
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:20,232
        they now stretch        
      this complex murrini      

53
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,469
        into what's known       
    as complex murrini cane.    

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,276
    once the cane stabilizes,   

55
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,877
           they cut it          
     into yardlong lengths,     

56
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,680
    then cool them gradually    
            in a kiln           

57
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,015
     to relieve any stresses    
          in the glass.         

58
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,285
   then they slice the lengths  
 into pieces 2/10 of an inch -- 

59
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,923
        the size required       
for the millefiori paperweights.

60
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,827
       now, using complex       
         murrini pieces         

61
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,096
       of different colors      
          and patterns,         

62
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,632
          they assemble         
     the paperweight design,    

63
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,901
        placing a unique,       
    hand-constructed murrini    

64
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,369
         in the center.         

65
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,639
     this one is a trillium.    

66
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,175
  next, they encircle the setup 

67
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,177
      with a heat-resistant     
         graphite ring.         

68
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,613
      this holds the pieces     
          in position.          

69
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,784
    after a final adjustment,   

70
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:14,587
  the artists preheat a white,  
    lace-patterned glass base   

71
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,988
     they prepared earlier.     

72
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,390
      this base will serve      
        as a blank canvas       

73
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,693
        for the colorful        
      paperweight pattern.      

74
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:27,065
  they push the molten crystal  
         onto the base.         

75
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,936
      the ring contains it      
     to the base's diameter.    

76
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,205
   then they reheat the base,   

77
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,008
    making it smooth and free   
         of air pockets,        

78
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,278
       preheat the complex      
         murrini setup,         

79
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,946
   and stick the base onto it.  

80
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,949
          like before,          
  the ring contains the spread. 

81
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,952
    another overall reheating   
        softens the glass       

82
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,887
         and fully fuses        
       all the components.      

83
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,691
       this fills crevices      
    and smoothes the surface.   

84
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,294
 now they return to the furnace 

85
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,364
 to encase this paperweight core
       in molten crystal.       

86
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,766
         using standard         
    glass-making techniques,    

87
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,435
      they work the crystal     
       to a bulbous shape.      

88
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:07,039
       then on the bottom,      
  they form a break-off point.  

89
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,310
     a sharp tap on the rod     
 cracks the glass at that point,

90
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,379
   separating it from the rod.  

91
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,547
  they heat the break-off point 

92
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,184
   and insert a piece of cane   
 bearing the artist's initials. 

93
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,320
   after a 12-hour controlled   
      cooling in the kiln,      

94
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,989
   they grind the base level.   

95
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,191
      then they polish away     
          the scratches         

96
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,693
   left by the grinding wheel.  

97
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,798
  after a thorough inspection,  

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,467
        these magnificent       
     millefiori paperweights    

99
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,002
     are ready to be shipped    

100
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,872
     to art-glass collectors    
           worldwide.           

101
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,622
  narrator: when the road ahead 
       is a sheet of ice,       

102
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:59,157
 rock salt can make the problem 
           melt away.           

103
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,027
  salt lowers the melting point 
      of water to thaw ice      

104
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,829
and also prevents its formation.

105
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,832
  salt was first used to de-ice 
      highways and walkways     

106
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,167
          in the 1930s,         

107
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,871
  but it was only in the 1960s  
      that its use spread.      

108
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,645
      unprocessed rock salt     
   actually looks like the ice  

109
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,881
   it will eventually be used   
            to melt.            

110
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,120
         this salt comes        
  from huge crystalline caverns 

111
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,122
         a thousand feet        
    below the earth's surface   

112
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,724
  along the canada/u.s. border. 

113
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,326
      that's 2/10 of a mile     
          underground.          

114
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,394
     these massive deposits     
           were formed          

115
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,330
      hundreds of millions      
          of years ago          

116
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:41,500
 when saltwater lakes dried up. 

117
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:49,141
  the clarity of this rock salt 
    is a sign of its purity.    

118
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:56,214
       this mineral is 98%      
    sodium chloride, or salt.   

119
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,017
    they extract it in chunks   
      from the rock's face      

120
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,687
       by using explosives      
          and drilling.         

121
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,825
     then a loader scoops up    
   the broken pieces of salt.   

122
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,962
         this is called         
      a low-profile loader.     

123
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:14,699
 it has a shorter height to fit 
 into tight spaces underground. 

124
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:19,838
      it transfers the salt     
     to the primary crusher.    

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,774
         this crusher is        
        a spiked cylinder       

126
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,176
  that spins to break the salt  
           into pieces          

127
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:27,513
    small enough to be moved    
         on a conveyor.         

128
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:31,049
   the conveyor takes the salt  
    to a production elevator    

129
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,252
        known as a skip.        

130
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,056
     it takes just a minute     
     and a half for the skip    

131
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:40,592
     to lift its heavy load     
   aboveground and up a tower.  

132
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:49,902
 when it stops, the bottom opens
    to empty the salty cargo.   

133
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,776
the salt funnels into two chutes
and lands on vibrating screens. 

134
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:04,016
  these screens are essentially 
   big automated salt shakers.  

135
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:07,619
 as they pulsate, they shake out
        the smaller bits,       

136
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,889
   while larger chunks move on  
      to be crushed again.      

137
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,492
          then it's on          
    to more shaking sifters.    

138
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,960
        these screen out        
    the very fine particles,    

139
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,697
  and what's left will be used  
        as de-icing salt.       

140
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:26,305
    there are several sifters   
          in this room.         

141
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,440
  they also sift out particles  

142
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,642
 that are about 4/10 of an inch 
             in size            

143
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,112
           to be used           
   as water-softening product.  

144
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,446
      and for this purpose,     

145
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,982
    the darker bits are seen    
         as undesirable,        

146
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,117
      so they remove those      

147
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,719
      with something called     
       an optical sorter.       

148
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,390
the optical sorter bounces light
     off the salt particles,    

149
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,991
         and a computer         
      reads the reflection      

150
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,793
          to determine          
    if they're light or dark.   

151
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:54,733
     jets of compressed air     
    then target the dark bits   

152
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,201
    and blast them downward,    

153
00:08:56,203 --> 00:09:00,205
    while the white particles   
        continue forward.       

154
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,542
     a closer look confirms     

155
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,946
     that the optical sorter    
  has done its job effectively. 

156
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,950
    the salt meant for water    
    softening is pure white,    

157
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:16,288
  while a few darker speckles   
  is acceptable for road salt.  

158
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,223
  outside in the holding area,  

159
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,960
  the salt accumulates in piles 
that look like huge snow drifts.

160
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,296
     if the winter is harsh,    

161
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:28,700
     road crews will use it     
     as fast as it piles up.    

162
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,770
          when it comes         
       to bulk purchasing,      

163
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,106
        orders don't come       
     much bigger than this.     

164
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,707
 highway maintenance departments

165
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,976
        buy de-icing salt       
        by the truckload        

166
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,911
 and create their own stockpiles

167
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,247
         to be prepared         
       for stormy weather.      

168
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,650
    but individual consumers,   
           of course,           

169
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,052
  buy de-icing salt by the bag. 

170
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,721
  in the packaging department,  

171
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,125
  automated trays relay plastic 
   bags to grippers overhead,   

172
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,962
         and the system         
       moves them forward.      

173
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,772
      suctioning robot arms     
       pry each bag open.       

174
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,610
 a puff of air inflates the bag,

175
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,079
  while a nozzle pipes measured 
  amounts of the de-icing salt  

176
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,948
          into the bag.         

177
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,950
      once the bag is full,     

178
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,220
       the system moves it      
         forward again,         

179
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:24,823
     and not a grain of salt    
           is spilled.          

180
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,358
     finally, a heat sealer     

181
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,561
        melts the plastic       
      to close the package.     

182
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:33,699
    it's taken about an hour    
       for this rock salt       

183
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:37,769
      to be mined, crushed,     
      sifted, and packaged.     

184
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,539
and now they're ready to take it
         to the street.         

185
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,256
            narrator:           
      the first nutcrackers     

186
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,792
           were plain,          
   purely functional devices.   

187
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,126
      by the 15th century,      

188
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,462
      european woodcarvers      
         began crafting         

189
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,465
      beautiful nutcrackers     
 shaped like animals and people.

190
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,100
  german artisans became known  

191
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,870
  for their majestic nutcracker 
       kings and soldiers,      

192
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,607
        just like the one       
 in tchaikovsky's famous ballet.

193
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,277
       this german company      

194
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,214
   has been crafting character  
     nutcrackers since 1928.    

195
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,283
    like porcelain figurines,   

196
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:27,752
     these nutcrackers sell     
as limited-edition collectibles.

197
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,688
  at hundreds of dollars each,  

198
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,091
 people don't actually use them 
    for the intended purpose.   

199
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,298
       but they can and do      
        perform the job.        

200
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,033
  you simply manipulate a lever 

201
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,236
  to open, then close the mouth 
     to crack the nutshell.     

202
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,839
 on the factory floor, they use 
    a multiblade circular saw   

203
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,509
    to cut all the body parts   
       out of linden wood.      

204
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:54,312
  linden is ideal because it's  
  lightweight, easy to carve,   

205
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,516
  and its color is pale enough  
         to mimic skin.         

206
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,722
 these blocks are on their way  
 to becoming nutcracker torsos. 

207
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,794
first, they go through a planer.

208
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,196
     it trims the four sides    
         of each block,         

209
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,899
  forming an octagonal shape... 

210
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,414
   ...from square to octagonal  
       and next to round.       

211
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,484
       but first, workers       
       use a circular saw       

212
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,087
        to cut the blocks       
    into torso-length pieces.   

213
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,225
   a conveyor feeds the pieces  
           one by one           

214
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,894
       into an automatic,       
      multi-station lathe.      

215
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,296
        the first station       
     rounds out the octagon,    

216
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,266
           then forms           
     the basic torso shape.     

217
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,837
       the second station       
      finalizes the shape.      

218
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,906
   then the next four stations  
      sand the wood smooth      

219
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,842
     so that the wood stain     
     they'll apply later on     

220
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,445
 will penetrate well and evenly.

221
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,448
       then the torsos go       
         three at a time        

222
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,250
     into a vertical router.    

223
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,454
   it cuts a notch in each one  

224
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:13,325
  for the lever that opens and  
 closes the nutcracker's mouth. 

225
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,066
next stop is a drilling machine,

226
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,469
   which simultaneously drills  
     all the holes required     

227
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,539
    to attach the body parts,   
  as well as the lever's axle.  

228
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,276
    now they dress the torso    
           in a coat,           

229
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,547
   which they create simply by  
 staining the wood a dark color.

230
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:36,948
      once the stain dries,     

231
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,551
     they spray on two coats    
      of semigloss lacquer.     

232
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,822
     every nutcracker stands    
        on a wooden base,       

233
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,358
      under which they burn     
       the company's logo.      

234
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,629
   it's a mark of authenticity  
         for collectors.        

235
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:53,998
 the automatic lathe also shapes
      the other body parts,     

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,300
       including the head.      

237
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,502
     workers attach a nose,     

238
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,705
      then, using a router,     
     cut holes for the eyes.    

239
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,975
   then they lightly spray on   
      a touch of red paint      

240
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,079
  to simulate a sun-kissed nose 
        and rosy cheeks.        

241
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,583
    then, with a steady hand,   

242
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,052
      they paint the whites     
         of the eyes...         

243
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,391
      ...and the eyebrows.      

244
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,595
      once the paint dries,     

245
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,732
      they apply some glue      
   to the center of each eye,   

246
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:30,102
  then affix an iris and pupil  
      made of enameled tin.     

247
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,407
     now they align the head    
         with the torso         

248
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,976
  and screw the parts together. 

249
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,147
   after decorating the coat    
   with buttons and a buckle,   

250
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,450
 they glue a strip of rabbit-fur
       hair to the head...      

251
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,422
      ...a rabbit-fur beard     

252
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,024
     to camouflage the notch    
         for the lever,         

253
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,827
    then they mount the torso   
         onto the legs,         

254
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,564
   which wear painted-on boots  
     and stand on the base.     

255
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,167
      then this nutcracker      
  percussionist gets his drum,  

256
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,338
 along with arms and drumsticks.

257
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,712
   they top him off with a hat  
   made of spray-painted wood.  

258
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,318
 most of the nutcracker's parts 

259
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,021
          join together         
       with wooden dowels.      

260
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,458
      a large dowel running     
  across the notch in the torso 

261
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,494
           is the axle          
   on which the lever rotates.  

262
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,804
       this extensive cast      
    of nutcracker characters    

263
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,671
     comes in various sizes,    

264
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,242
 and you can even special-order 
      a life-sized version.     

265
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,294
 narrator: car doors have come a
 long way over the last century.

266
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,097
         they're lighter        
  for improved fuel efficiency  

267
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,568
and stronger to better withstand
     the force of an impact.    

268
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,504
     they also contain a lot    
     of electronic gadgetry,    

269
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,438
like speakers and power windows,

270
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,942
      all of which enhance      
       the daily commute.       

271
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,114
        a car door is one       
       of the first things      

272
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:25,584
      many people reach for     
    as they start their day,    

273
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:29,120
   so let's unlock the mystery  
        of how it's made.       

274
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,656
it all starts with carbon steel,

275
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,326
     an alloy that's strong,    
         yet malleable.         

276
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,064
        machinery uncoils       
       and straightens it.      

277
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,399
     a large blade slices it    
     to the desired length,     

278
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,668
 producing sheets called blanks.

279
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,870
         then it's over         
      to a powerful press.      

280
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,006
       this particular one      
        is a trial press,       

281
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,408
   which offers a better view   
         of the process         

282
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,209
          than the one          
     on the production line.    

283
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,679
   the press forces the blank   
           into a die,          

284
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,282
    giving it the basic shape   
        of two car doors.       

285
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,684
          it's a design         
     that's been engineered     

286
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,287
      for both aerodynamics     
          and strength.         

287
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,557
  back on the production line,  

288
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,726
        the main press is       
     churning out car doors.    

289
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,495
an automated device with fingers

290
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,564
           then grips           
     the newly shaped steel     

291
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,033
        and transfers it        
       to a punch cutter.       

292
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,500
   it separates the two doors   

293
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:21,172
   and trims the excess metal   
         from the edges.        

294
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,708
   with the outer door panels   
          now complete,         

295
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,512
     a handler inspects them    
 for bumps, dents, or scratches.

296
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,715
     he approves only those     
  that are absolutely flawless. 

297
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,518
    the next worker arranges    
        the window frame,       

298
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,787
       a reinforcing plate      
         for the hinge,         

299
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,321
    and the inner door panel,   

300
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,591
        all on a special        
        clamping fixture.       

301
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:43,060
   its fingers grip the parts   
    to hold them in position    

302
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,596
     as the fixture rotates     

303
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,566
     and two robots move in     
     to weld them together.     

304
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,069
      at the next station,      

305
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:55,273
 the worker arranges steel bars 
and tubes on a robotic platform.

306
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,875
  they add strength to the door 

307
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:00,011
   so it will better withstand  
           any impact.          

308
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:03,881
 he places the inner door panel 
    over the bars and tubes.    

309
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,752
      the robotic platform      
  angles the parts for welding. 

310
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,158
 another robot applies adhesive 

311
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,759
           to the rim           
    of the outer door panel.    

312
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,397
    more robots dab adhesive    
    at strategic locations.     

313
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,104
those dabs match up to the tubes
   and bars on the inner panel  

314
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,640
         as they mate it        
        to the outer one.       

315
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,244
   a special press then folds   
   the lip of the outer panel   

316
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,579
       over the inner one.      

317
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:38,450
this hemming gives the assembled
     car door a neater edge.    

318
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,523
 with the inner and outer panels
           now joined,          

319
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,526
     the car door undergoes     
      rustproofing, paint,      

320
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,795
and other protective treatments.

321
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,997
 now, over on the assembly line,

322
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,666
    a worker fits the handle    
         into its niche         

323
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,871
    and bolts it to the door    
      from the other side.      

324
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:03,941
           chrome trim          
     is clipped into place.     

325
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,276
      moving down the line,     

326
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,679
        a worker installs       
      a small, fixed window     

327
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,747
   in the groove of the frame.  

328
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,884
   he uses a plastic protector  
      to prevent scratches      

329
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,421
 as he slides the larger window 
    into its slot in the door   

330
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,824
 and links it to a power-lifting
        mechanism inside.       

331
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,833
  he separates the two windows  
      with a metal divider.     

332
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,301
      at the next station,      

333
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,405
       this car door gets       
 an automated side-view mirror. 

334
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,976
 they're now ready for the inner
     panel and its workings.    

335
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,445
       the employee wires       
      the panel to the door     

336
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,181
    and snaps it into place.    

337
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,985
   he tests the power windows,  
 and they close to a tight seal,

338
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:49,654
           indicating           
   a successful installation.   

339
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,190
  a special elevator now lowers 
     the completed car doors    

340
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,194
           6 1/2 yards          
      to the next station.      

341
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,529
   a worker unloads each door   

342
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,598
          with the help         
       of a pneumatic arm.      

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,134
     this device shoulders      
     the weight of the part     

344
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,970
and correctly positions the door
        for installation.       

345
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,678
   he drives bolts into hinges  
 to attach the door to the car. 

346
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,945
        on the door side,       

347
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,415
         the heavy-duty         
       reinforcement plate      

348
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,018
      surrounds the hinges      
       and supports them.       

349
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,352
  the whole weight of the door  

350
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,656
     will hang on this plate    
   as it swings open and shut.  

351
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,626
 with all the panels installed, 

352
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,628
            it's time           
   for the final adjustments.   

353
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,564
    they call this finessing.   

354
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,499
     they examine each panel    

355
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,769
   to confirm that it's flush   
  to the rest of the car body,  

356
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:41,372
 and they tweak the installation
        job where needed.       

357
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,909
   finally, they're satisfied   
   the assembly is airtight,    

358
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,913
 so it's time to close the door 
       on this production.
