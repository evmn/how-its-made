a lot happens when an inflated rubber ball hits the ground.  

16

the rubber compresses and quickly snaps       

17

back to its round shape.    

18

that snapping back makes the ball bounce.     

19
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,066
in addition, the air inside the ball acts      

20
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:10,803
as a tightly coiled spring increasing the rebound.    

21

this type of ball is at the heart of many games,

from basketball to soccer to volleyball.    

26

at the core is an inflated rubber bladder.        

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,426
making it starts with a sheet of natural rubber.       

28
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,964
the factory worker folds it in a specific configuration.  

29
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,768
he places a die on top and activates a press     

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,439
to force it through the layers,
which cuts out the shape.

he now has the bladder of a sports ball.       

32
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:53,112
he brushes an adhesive around the hole in the bladder 

33
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,615
and inserts a plug.      

34
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,655
another worker inflates the rubber bladder       

35
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,724
as she places it in a spherical chamber.

at a temperature of 284 degrees fahrenheit.    

38
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,167
the rubber bladder spins on a revolving cylinder,    

39
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:18,137
causing it to take up nylon threads.         

40
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,140
the threads twist around the bladder and form a layer  

41
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:25,077
that both strengthens it and keeps it round.      

42

the material that will form the exterior of the ball    

43
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,550
is made using colored synthetic
rubber, natural rubber,

magnesium carbonate, and mineral oil.        

45
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:38,156
once it cures, a worker rolls it into thick sheets   

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,693
and slices it to a specific width.

this blue rubber will be used for volleyballs.        

49
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,103
the folded rubber now travels between a series of rollers.  

50
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:54,040
they flatten it and press it extremely thin,       

51
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:57,109
and it becomes both lightweight and formable.

into the bladder.       

79

he closes the lid.

another worker inserts a fill valve into the hole.  

91

then, mechanical fists squeeze the ball to deflate it.

92
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,856
this prepares it for packaging.

93

worker can keep moving     

103
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,699
while staying seated.     

104
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,103
the support structure is engineered for flexibility,  

105
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:15,207
so while sitting, a person can bounce, tilt, and sway.  

106
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,648
motion chairs redefine the act of sitting.      

107
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,182
the stem is springy,      

108
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,652
and the connection to the seat is elastic.    

109
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:31,189
this allows the office worker to be active while sitting.  

110
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,127
making a motion chair starts with glass-reinforced plastic, 

111
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,197
which is a strong and lightweight material.   

112
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,934
these granules will be used to make the core of the seat. 

113
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:46,972
a robot inserts a steel fastener
in the center of the seat mold.

114
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:50,208
the mold closes, and the machine
melts the plastic       

115
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,811
and injects it into the mold. 

116
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:56,348
the plastic quickly solidifies around the steel fastener,   

117
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,085
and it becomes part of the seat core.       

118
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,354
a robot with suctioning grippers

119
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:07,159
pulls the convex-shaped seat core out.         

120
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,960
a worker assembles a height-adjustment      

121
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,331
lever in the hole beside the one for the seat stem.   

122
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,504
a molded plastic top completes the seat core.    

123
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,177
he anchors it to the core with numerous screws,     

124
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:31,116
so even with heavy use, the top
should stay firmly in place.  

125
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,119
he visually inspects the seat core and confirms   

126
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,522
that it looks solid.      

127
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:43,062
cushioning foam and fabric complete the seat.       

128
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,264
a worker assembles roller mechanisms that will facilitate

129
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,002
the vertical movements of the chair's stem.      

130
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:54,205
using a special assembly tool, she presses the plastic roller 

131
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,010
and two end brackets on a metal cylinder.      

132
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:01,480
she then applies an index to an aluminum support column 

133
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,681
that serves as a guide     

134
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,684
for setting the tension of an outer spring.      

135
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,554
she inserts the roller mechanisms in slots      

136
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,689
at the other end of the column.

137
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,892
strips of fabric tape keep the rollers in place.   

138
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,633
an air cylinder presses    
the outer sleeve onto the column

139
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,437
so that it sits above the tension index.       

140
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,906
a screw between the inner and outer cylinders 

141
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,043
keeps them in position.    

142
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,178
next up is a compression part 

143
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,048
for setting the position of the outer seat spring.   

144
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,720
a worker slides a metal ring between the compression part  

145
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,721
and the support column.    

146
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,760
he inserts a gas spring into the double-walled seat stem.  

147
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:53,132
he now slides the outer spring onto the assembly.   

148
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,671
he installs a plastic casing over the gas spring.      

149
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:04,275
then he puts the seat stem inside a press chamber.    

150
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,345
he adds a top collar to the center of the gas spring

151
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,081
as well as a snap ring.    

152
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,221
he activates the press, and  
it squeezes everything together.

153
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,894
next is a stand with flexible rubber parts     

154
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:26,965
that will make lateral     
movement possible while sitting.

155
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:31,236
the worker attaches the flexible
stand to a circular base.   

156
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,372
he confirms that holes for rolling casters or gliders 

157
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,909
in the base are the correct dimension.     

158
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,647
he screws a dial for setting lateral movement  

159
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,516
onto the protruding fastener. 

160
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:49,054
he secures it with a nut and tightens it.        

161
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,390
he covers the nut with a rubber cap.       

162
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,930
a tester will now evaluate the motion chair's performance.

163
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,999
he attaches the stem to the base,          

164
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,136
and he fastens the seat to the protruding rod.     

165
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,876
he sits down and bounces around
to test the range of movement. 

166
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,811
these tests are done intermittently to confirm   

167
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,950
that the the product      
consistently meets requirements.

168
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,953
this motion chair is now ready for shipping.         

169
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,823
the packer plugs a hole in the base ring.       

170
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,827
this hole is for attaching an optional backrest.     

171
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,699
he applies a sticker with the product name.     

172
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,836
all of the parts of the motion chair      

173
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:42,373
can be easily assembled on location.          

174
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,978
designed to discourage rigid sitting and encourage movement 

175
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,779
in any direction,       

176
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,781
it will compel the person using it      

177
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,117
to use his or her core muscles 

178
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,120
and be less sedentary on the job.          

179
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,056
with the motion chair, it just may be possible    

180
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,259
to get fit while you sit.   

181
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,338
narrator: for at least a century,    

182
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,073
montreal's jewish delis    

183
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,809
have been serving smoked meat on rye.      

184
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,411
the exact origins of this particular deli meat      

185
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,949
are a matter of debate with many claims to its invention. 

186
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,551
the juicy details have been lost to time,    

187
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,152
but montreal smoked meat    

188
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,722
continues to have an enduring appeal.      

189
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,228
a cross between corn beef and pastrami,         

190
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,829
montreal smoked meat      

191
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,799
has attracted a foodie following around the world.  

192
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,371
montreal smoked meat starts with brisket,      

193
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,441
which is a cut from the cow's upper chest.     

194
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,310
a worker thaws the previously frozen briskets 

195
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,381
in a refrigerator for 10 hours.

196
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,051
a team slices off the biggest chunks of fat   

197
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,520
using round, air-powered blades.

198
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,256
the excess fat will be shipped to another factory       

199
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,392
and used to make soap.     

200
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,528
the workers use a sharp butcher's knife        

201
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,596
to remove smaller pieces of fat,

202
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,532
leaving just enough for flavor.

203
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,336
next, they prepare the brine. 

204
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,339
along with salt and sugar, there's a secret recipe    

205
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,608
of spices that includes peppers,       

206
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,477
mustard seed, allspice, and cinnamon.    

207
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,014
the operator combines the salt and sugar       

208
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:32,484
with ice-cold water in a high-speed mixer.     

209
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,819
the spices have been premixed in water       

210
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:38,357
to produce a spice concentrate.

211
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,826
the next worker loads the trimmed briskets      

212
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:43,361
onto a conveyor.        

213
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,898
it takes the briskets under an array of long needles    

214
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,104
that inject the brine into the meat repeatedly.   

215
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:56,374
laced with brine, the briskets then fall into a bin.     

216
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,778
a worker transfers the juicy briskets into a vacuum tumbler.

217
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,381
it pulls air from the chamber, 

218
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,784
causing the briskets to absorb more brine.     

219
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,653
the tumbler tosses the briskets for 10 hours,   

220
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,856
massaging the brine into the meat.         

221
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,059
a layer of protein also forms on the surface.     

222
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:17,395
this holds the brine in place. 

223
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:22,133
in the meantime, a worker mixes
the ingredients for the dry rub.

224
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,069
it's comprised of the same spices             

225
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,804
that were used in the brine  

226
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,006
along with clumps of fresh garlic.        

227
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,079
after the briskets have been well marinated,        

228
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,615
the operator adds the dry rub. 

229
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,751
he turns on the tumbler for another half hour.     

230
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:44,423
the dry rub mixture coats the surface of the meat.    

231
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,157
this system is an alternative 

232
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,227
to rubbing the spices onto the briskets by hand.   

233
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,663
it's faster and very efficient.

234
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,634
coated with smoked meat spices 

235
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,969
and injected with flavorful brine,     

236
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,405
the briskets are now ready for roasting.      

237
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:10,515
an employee rolls racks of the 
spicy briskets into a huge oven.

238
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,186
the briskets steam-roast at 210 degrees fahrenheit   

239
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,322
for 8 to 10 hours,       

240
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,291
but the workers don't actually smoke the briskets.  

241
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,394
it's the spices and brine that give them         

242
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,398
that montreal smoked meat flavor.      

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,599
after the briskets have been chilled,       

244
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,203
workers transfer them to plastic bags        

245
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,939
and place them on a conveyor. 

246
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,143
moving forward, a vacuum-sealing
head drops down to shrink-wrap 

247
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,412
the plastic to the meat.    

248
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,615
the vacuum seal and the smoked meat spices combined  

249
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,351
give the meat a long shelf life.

250
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:51,022
refrigerated, it will stay fresh
for up to 45 days.       

251
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,426
this plant ships the entire brisket to restaurants.    

252
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,161
at the restaurant, they will re-steam and slice  

253
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,430
the brisket before serving.  

254
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,833
next, the smoked meat is pre-sliced         

255
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,702
to sell in supermarkets.    

256
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:09,441
an automatic meat slicer carves
it into thin pieces in seconds.

257
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,244
a worker retrieves the sliced smoked meat     

258
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,514
and sets it on a tray.     

259
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,516
transferred to a weigh station,

260
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:22,653
workers divide the slices into 6-ounce portions.     

261
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,258
then they roll up the smoked meat slices.    

262
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,264
a worker places the rolled meat
into plastic pouches on a rack.

263
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,932
the racks move forward,    

264
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,535
and a vacuum sealer applies a top film,      

265
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:41,406
creating little packets of sliced smoked meat.     

266
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,476
after a quick bake to pasteurize the meat,    

267
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,412
he puts six packets into compartments on a conveyor.  

268
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:53,351
a pusher moves the six packets 
of smoked meat into an open box.

269
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,621
the system seals the ends of the boxes.         

270
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,226
workers weigh the box of smoked meat slices.     

271
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,094
it has taken about 30 hours  

272
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,797
to produce this batch of montreal smoked meat.    

273
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,768
it's time to slice it thin and pile it thick       

274
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,037
between slabs of mustard-slathered rye.   

275
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,541
now, that's a deli lunch, montreal-style.        

276
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,524
narrator: a motorized scooter is a souped-up version     

277
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,259
of an ordinary scooter.    

278
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,994
instead of propelling the wheels
by pushing off the ground   

279
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,265
with one leg,         
an engine does most of the work.

280
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,868
some motorized scooters are kids' toys,        

281
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,070
but others are sturdy vehicles 

282
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,440
suitable for commuting, utility, and recreation.    

283
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,077
this motorized scooter     

284
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,213
has wheels large enough and tires wide enough     

285
00:16:55,215 --> 00:17:00,084
to drive on any surface, even off road.         

286
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,821
the manufacturer contracts this factory          

287
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:05,090
to make the frame components. 

288
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,893
machines cut hollow steel tubes
to the required length.    

289
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,297
then workers program an automated bending machine  

290
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,100
to bend each one to the required shape.     

291
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,174
they make five tubular frame parts per scooter,    

292
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,644
strictly following the technical drawing supplied   

293
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,514
by the manufacturer.      

294
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,249
the scooter company subcontracts
the frame assembly       

295
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,386
to another factory.      

296
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,656
there, a welder mounts the components on a jig,    

297
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:42,594
which positions them correctly while he welds them together. 

298
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:46,598
the non-tubular, flat-frame parts are prepared in house,  

299
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,968
cut from sheet steel by a computer-guided laser cutter.

300
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:55,072
these flat crossbars support the footboard     

301
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,476
on which the rider stands.   

302
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,012
this flat plate supports the battery,     

303
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:05,416
and these arms support the rear wheel and motor.   

304
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,486
after applying a coat of anticorrosion paint,    

305
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,555
workers install the side reflectors      

306
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,424
and the knob that secures the battery.   

307
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,962
the paint is baked on for maximum durability.    

308
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:21,433
the scooter manufacturer subcontracts the wheel rims  

309
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,767
to another factory       

310
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,304
that specializes in high-precision metal spinning. 

311
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,773
a worker there mounts an aluminum disk        

312
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,976
onto a computer-guided lathe, 

313
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:35,313
positioning it right next to a rim-shaped steel mold.  

314
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,716
two rollers push and stretch the disk over the mold,    

315
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,152
forming the aluminum to the rim's shape.      

316
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,459
another worker mounts the rim on a manual-spinning lathe   

317
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,594
to finish the shaping.     

318
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:54,799
first, with a cutting knife, he trims the edge.       

319
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,134
after lubricating the edge with soap,      

320
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,072
he uses a forming bar     
to turn it inward to form a lip.

321
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,610
then, with the forming roller, 

322
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,813
he stretches the lip to shape a flange.

325
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,891
back at the scooter factory, a worker begins installing   

326
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,493
the vehicle's silent electric motor.        

327
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,230
its cable will plug into the electronic module     

328
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:29,634
that runs the motor, accelerator, and battery.   

329
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,236
the motor is actually located inside the hub         

330
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,771
of the rear wheel.       

331
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,442
this mounting ring holds it in place.       

332
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,512
he installs a brake disc on top of the motor      

333
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,514
and another on the front wheel.

334
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,917
a mechanical cable connects each handlebar brake lever   

335
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,318
to the brake calipers.     

336
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,989
when the driver pulls the   
levers, the brake calipers clamp

337
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:54,658
the discs to the wheels, stopping rotation.       

338
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,927
now the final assembly --   

339
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,066
workers bolt the rear wheel to the frame's support arms.  

340
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,201
they insert the height-adjustable fork,  

341
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,538
made of steel and aluminum, into the steering column.   

342
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,274
next, the worker installs the handlebars,        

343
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,876
which have a thumb-operated accelerator throttle,     

344
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,679
an lcd monitor and two hand brakes,      

345
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,682
each with a mechanical cable for the calipers.    

346
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,019
each hand brake also has one electrical cable. 

347
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,353
he connects the throttle line 

348
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,023
and the electrical cables to the monitor.        

349
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,226
then he connects the monitor to the controller.       

350
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,760
when the rider brakes,     

351
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,497
the controller also cuts power to the motor, 

352
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:36,033
which allows the scooter's 48-volt lithium ion battery  

353
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,370
to regenerate.         

354
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,372
this screw knob holds the battery          

355
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,709
securely against the battery support plate.   

356
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,111
he connects the battery to the controller,       

357
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,181
then the mechanical cable from one hand-brake lever   

358
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,916
to the front brake calipers  

359
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,220
and from the other hand brake lever to the rear calipers.  

360
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,657
charging the battery takes four hours        

361
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,327
when plugged in to a regular household outlet, 

362

and a full charge lasts 31 to 37 miles.     

363
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,801
the scooter can climb an 11% incline         

364
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:13,605
