the computer's brain, called the motherboard,    

16

that will be soldered to the board.         

20
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,829
this machine places a stencil of the component layout

and applies solder paste through the openings.     

23

a quality-inspection camera photographs the solder paste

and sends the images to a computer.         

25

the computer analyzes them, looking for any missing paste, 

26

misalignment, or other mistakes.

27

if the board passes inspection,

28
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,517
it passes through 15 robotic machines,      

29

this panettone recipe calls for egg yolks only.   

120

this process is called proofing the dough.      

128
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,457
the dough undergoes multiple proofings.

147
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:42,454
some of the water in the dough will evaporate during baking  

148
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:46,791
and the panettone should end up about two pounds.

149

the molds will also be used as retail packaging.      

154
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,815
after about an hour in the warming chamber,    

155
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,485
the dough chunks have doubled in size.     

156
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,155
the baker works them into a rounder form      

157
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,691
and transfers them to paper molds.        

158
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:23,495
then it's back into the warming
chamber for another proofing. 

159
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,030
as the dough rises,      

160
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:29,434
the round shape is contained by the paper molds.      

161
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,637
after six hours, he takes out the molds and carves      

162
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,373
crosses into the risen dough. 

163
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,978
he adds small pieces of butter to the middle of each cross.  

164
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,648
after 24 hours of preparation, 

165
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,384
the panettones are ready to be cooked.         

166
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:50,589
they bake for 45 minutes at 320 degrees fahrenheit.   

167
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,193
once complete, he quickly spears each panettone     

168
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,463
with a metal rod near the base and hangs it upside down.   

169
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,333
the panettones cool for up to 24 hours          

170
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,402
in this upside-down suspended state.        

171
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,206
this stretches the warm breads to give them their dome shape 

172
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,610
and stops them from caving inward.      

173
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:15,647
once cooled, the panettones are
ready to be wrapped for retail.

174
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,688
all that proofing has allowed the flavors to mature     

175
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,693
and the fluffy texture to develop.          

176
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,094
the yeast will act as the preservative,

00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,789
narrator: the saxophone was invented in the mid-1800s   

180
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,924
by adolphe sax,        

181
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,593
the son of belgium's chief instrument maker.       

182
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:05,597
with the saxophone, sax blended
the power of a brass horn   

183
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,200
with the nuances of a woodwind instrument.   

184
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,469
this instrument has the ability
to sound            

185
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,405
bright and edgy or dark and moody.       

186
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,010
even though it's made of brass or high-copper alloys,     

187
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,547
the saxophone is technically a woodwind instrument.     

188
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,415
that's because it produces sound

189
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:28,286
by vibrating a reed attached to the mouthpiece.  

190
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,622
the process of making a saxophone          

191
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,159
starts with a long brass or copper sheath.       

192
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,895
a hydraulic punch cuts the metal
into rectangles.        

193
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,433
after tracing a flared pattern onto one piece of metal,    

194
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,902
a craftsman aligns the pattern with the punch         

195
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,837
to cut out the part.      

196
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,042
this part will now be formed into the saxophone's bell.   

197
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,577
the worker folds it around the metal rod         

198
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,646
and pounds it with a wooden stick      

199
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,348
to do some initial shaping.  

200
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:05,523
this takes the part from flat to three dimensional.     

201
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,525
after the seam has been welded,

202
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,529
more hammering rounds the shape
substantially         

203
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,598
and improves on the flare at the end.    

204
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,868
next, the craftsman repeatedly pounds the flare        

205
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,070
to form it into a bell.    

206
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,206
hand-hammering shapes the metal

207
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,475
and also alters the physical properties    

208
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,678
to make the sound more resonant.         

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,746
throughout the forming of the instrument, 

210
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,949
it is heated with a torch.   

211
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,986
this makes the metal flexible enough to be shaped.      

212
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,259
next, he slides the bell onto a form.          

213
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:48,633
he brushes lubricant onto the metal...          

214
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,503
and lowers a roller.      

215
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:55,774
the form spins the curved bell against the roller,    

216
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,443
which smoothes out dents and forces the bell      

217
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,912
to conform           
to the dimensions of the roller.

218
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,854
the rolled saxophone bell is the one on the right.    

219
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,589
it's dramatically different.  

220
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:17,395
now we can see the saxophone's body take shape.  

221
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,199
it starts with this piece of metal that's wider at one end. 

222
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:25,003
the operator places it under a cone-shaped form.   

223
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,272
using hydraulics, it descends to fold the part        

224
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,209
and imprint the cone shape on the metal.         

225
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,744
after more forming,      

226
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,614
another worker welds the seams to complete the cone.     

227
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,718
this part of the instrument is also called the tube.    

228
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,290
meanwhile, the forming work on the saxophone bell     

229
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,625
has been completed.      

230
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,029
a worker locks the upper part of the bell into a machine   

231
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,634
and turns the punch device to cut the tone holes.     

232
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:59,104
sound waves will be emitted  
through both the open tone holes

233
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,239
and the bell's flare.     

234
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,641
later, another worker aims a torch          

235
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,444
at the saxophone body to soften the metal,      

236
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:11,316
so that the rims of the tone holes can now be formed.    

237
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:15,787
he slides the body onto a steel
mandrel with round inserts.  

238
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:19,524
he aligns the tone holes with holes on the mandrel.   

239
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,595
he sets a guide rack on top, aligning the holes in the rack 

240
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,597
with the holes in the instrument.       

241
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,999
he inserts tools through the holes       

242
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,069
and threads them into the round
inserts in the mandrel.    

243
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:36,340
a support bracket props up the tools.         

244
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,412
using the tools, he pulls the inserts through the holes. 

245
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:44,349
this forms a rim around each hole.       

246
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,818
the raised edging will allow key cups      

247
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,321
to close the tone holes effectively.       

248
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:56,428
the craftsman drills the rims to smooth and level them.   

249
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,896
this will prevent gaps that could affect the sound  

250
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,900
of the instrument when the key cups close.    

251
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,372
the next part is the bow,   

252
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,910
which will link the saxophone bell and body.  

253
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,845
the craftsman brushes a cleaning agent        

254
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,248
known as flux onto one end.  

255
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,982
he connects the two parts   

256
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,420
and applies more flux to    
the bell where it meets the bow.

257
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,659
he then melts solder where the two parts come together,  

258
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:30,662
completing this critical connection.      

259
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,365
the solder makes the joint airtight.           

260
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:40,405
he turns over the bell and bow assembly to complete the job, 

261
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,109
ensuring that the solder encompasses the entire joint. 

262
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,082
he dabs water onto the soldered
joint to cool it down.     

263
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,419
but before this saxophone is ready to make music,    

264
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,823
a few more steps must be taken for good measure.

other keys are grouped together
on a brass plate known as a rib.

he spaces the key posts evenly on a rod        

285
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:24,109
that serves as an alignment tool.

several overhead clamps hold the posts in place on the rib.

and uncaps the tone holes for now.            

301
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,305
a cleaning agent is brushed onto
the back of a rib       

302
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:31,342
that supports a second grouping of key posts.

303
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,846
he solders the rib to the upper
part of the saxophone body   

304
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,015
and takes the alignment rod off.

305
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,654
the posts have been installed in a specific sequence     

306
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:46,324
to support extending keys on a hinge rod.        

307
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,861
later, another worker polishes the bow and bell assembly   

308
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,531
against a buffing wheel, which polishes the instrument 

309
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,000
to remove smudges or fingerprints        

310
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,803
and give the brass parts a mirror finish.        

311
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,745
they dip the brass saxophone parts in a bath   

312
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:11,483
where sound waves help     
remove residual dirt and grease.

313
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,152
there's also a chemical primer in the bath          

314
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,421
that will help a lacquer bond to the brass.         

315
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,391
a technician sprays the lacquer
onto the brass         

316
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:24,162
to protect it from corrosion and tarnish.  

317
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,431
floral artwork will add visual flair          

318
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:30,435
to this copper saxophone bell. 

319
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:34,572
the copper has been painted  
black to make the art stand out.

320
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,042
the artist follows the stencil with an etching tool,     

321
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,178
rotating it using a twirling motion technique,  

322
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,180
etching in fluid movements.  

323
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,184
he doesn't stop until he's completed a line     

324
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,854
to prevent any inconsistencies in the engraving.       

325
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,391
after he completes the pattern,
he does detail work.      

326
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:58,395
this exposes the copper metal and makes the art pop.     

327
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,965
returning to the brass saxophone now,         

328
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:06,003
a technician screws long hinge rods to the posts.    

329
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,605
he attaches the keys,     

330
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:11,810
which have been equipped with pads in the cups.     

331
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:15,280
a tiny screw secures this grouping of keys.     

332
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,951
he turns the saxophone over, inserts a light,        

333
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:26,357
and looks for escaping rays, making adjustments if needed. 

334
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,096
he installs needle springs under
the key rods and main hinge rod.

335
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,231
they'll enable the keys to spring back         

336
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,567
after they're pressed.     

337
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:40,304
he tests the spring action and,
again, checks for light leaks. 

338
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,708
he now fits the bell bow to the main body.       

339
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,644
there's a connecting ring that holds them together,   

340
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,181
but he'll also lock them in place with a screw.     

341
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,649
from start to finish,     

342
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:56,320
it takes about a month to craft this saxophone.    

343
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,455
whether it's made out of basic brass         

344
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,593
or something a little showier, the look of the instrument   

345
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,929
can reflect          
the saxophonist's playing style,

346
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,665
but the tone of the instrument defines it.
