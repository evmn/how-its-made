00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,957
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,226
...eyeglass lenses...

3
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,029
granite...

4
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,163
potato chips...

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,566
and computer microprocessors.

6
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,005
remember when wearing coke-bottle eyeglasses

7
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,708
was your one-way ticket to being the class nerd?

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,979
well, today, even if you need a heavy-duty prescription,

9
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,514
you can wear fashionable eyeglasses

10
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,284
with thin and lightweight plastic lenses.

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,391
eyeglass lenses start out as large plastic disks.

12
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,726
the first step

13
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,929
is to place a protective film over the convex side

14
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,464
so it won't get damaged

15
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,033
while the lab works on the concave side.

16
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,072
with a scanner, they retrieve the customer's prescription

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,607
from the central computer.

18
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,809
then they program those measurements

19
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,611
into the tray holding the disks.

20
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:24,149
next, they heat up a mixture of seven metals to 122 degrees.

21
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,885
any hotter would melt the disk on contact.

22
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,488
out of that molten metal, they mold an attachment.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,024
this allows the disk

24
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,460
to be mounted on a machine for tooling.

25
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,897
at this point, robots take over.

26
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,633
when the tray with the disks arrives,

27
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,436
the milling machine reads the prescription information,

28
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,173
then reshapes the plastic accordingly.

29
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,041
first, it thins the disk

30
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,178
and shaves it down to a smaller diameter.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,382
then it creates the required curvature.

32
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,918
the disk is now a lens.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,854
but you can still see the concentric circles

34
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,189
left by the tooling,

35
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,658
and the surface of the lens is rough,

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,729
so they polish it using abrasive paper

37
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,000
under water heated precisely to 66 degrees.

38
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,736
the water temperature must be constant,

39
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,672
or else the lens will become deformed.

40
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,075
now that the lens is perfectly shaped,

41
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,377
they remove the metal attachment...

42
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,619
...then peel off the protective film

43
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,921
on the other side.

44
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,695
using a machine called a lensometer,

45
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,932
they make sure the prescription
is accurate.

46
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,977
next, the lenses go through

47
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,781
an automated 15-stage chemical cleaning

48
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,718
then are coated with varnish to make them scratch-resistant.

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,321
they go into an oven for three hours

50
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,889
until the varnish cures.

51
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,594
next comes the antireflection treatment.

52
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,731
this will increase the lenses' transparency,

53
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,399
allowing in more light.

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,936
the lenses go into a chamber.

55
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,072
they add different powdered chemicals,

56
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,808
such as silicium oxide, titanium oxide,

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,411
and zirconium oxide.

58
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,948
they close the door, then pump all the air out of the chamber.

59
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,685
using a high-powered electron beam,

60
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,621
they heat the chemicals to the boiling point.

61
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,890
the powders transform from solid to gas,

62
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,727
coating the lenses in the process.

63
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,299
it's finally time to fit the lenses to the frame.

64
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,839
they position a suction cup on the lenses

65
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,542
to hold them in place during the fitting.

66
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:14,286
an automated machine traces the shape of the frame...

67
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,496
...then cuts the lenses to that shape.

68
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:42,414
with regular frames, the lenses simply pop in.

69
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,283
to attach ultralight metal frames,

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,654
they drill holes right through the lenses.

71
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:19,184
from plastic disk to the latest in eyewear

72
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,853
in just three days.

73
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,196
narrator: what do you get when you cross a spider with a goat?

74
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,665
a silk fiber stronger than steel,

75
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,600
yet more elastic than nylon.

76
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,736
researchers implanted a spider's web-spinning genes

77
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,806
into a goat's mammary glands.

78
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,975
the result -- goat's milk with silk proteins,

79
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:48,180
the raw material for a fabric strong enough to be bulletproof.

80
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,622
granite is one of the strongest stones on earth,

81
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,292
and it's the darling of decor these days.

82
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,561
as an indoor/outdoor building material,

83
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,766
it's timeless, elegant, and resistant to acid rain.

84
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,571
nature's granite factory

85
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,641
lies many miles beneath the earth's surface.

86
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,110
boiling molten rock called "magma"

87
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,847
builds up pressure from the intense heat

88
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,718
and rises through cracks and crevices in the earth's crust.

89
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,389
as it rises, it slowly cools and solidifies into granite.

90
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,393
most granite is buried under sedimentary rock,

91
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,395
which makes up most of the earth's surface.

92
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,332
the challenge is to extract as much granite

93
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,200
from the quarry as possible

94
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,535
while losing as little as possible to damage

95
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,072
from the extraction process.

96
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,876
they start by outlining a section of rock wall

97
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:54,946
up to 99 feet long by 23 feet wide.

98
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,616
they use a gas flame to burn long, narrow channels

99
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,218
to free up the sides.

100
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,621
then they drill holes 23 feet deep

101
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,891
along the back and bottom.

102
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,227
they feed explosive cables into the holes.

103
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,972
then they set it off.

104
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,244
the explosion detaches the section.

105
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,514
then they use a combination of drills, steel pegs,

106
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,917
plates, and wedges to cut it down

107
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,186
and cut it down further until they have rough blocks

108
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,991
measuring 10 feet long by 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep,

109
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,760
a size the granite factory can handle.

110
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,395
the blocks may be small,

111
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,700
but each one weighs more than 45,000 pounds.

112
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,274
at the factory, the first cut is called "slabbing."

113
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,009
they use this type of saw

114
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,079
to cut slabs more than 2 inches thick.

115
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,747
the blade's metal segments

116
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,216
contain synthetic diamond particles,

117
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,686
which create the friction needed
to make the cut.

118
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,423
water keeps the saw from overheating.

119
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,491
it's a slow process.

120
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:19,164
the saw cuts less than 22 square
feet of granite per hour.

121
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,501
they use a gang saw to cut slabs
thinner than 5 centimeters

122
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,037
to make kitchen countertops, for example.

123
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,973
this saw has steel blades --

124
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:31,776
tense enough not to bend under the pressure of cutting

125
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,979
and calibrated to cut as straight as possible.

126
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,384
the gang saw cuts at a rate of about 86 square feet per hour.

127
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:43,788
it takes three entire days to cut through the rough block.

128
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,863
once a slab is cut, it goes for polishing.

129
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,266
this is what will bring out the beauty of the stone.

130
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,536
the polishing line has 19 heads,

131
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,207
each of which has six bricks that polish by abrasion,

132
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,341
like sandpaper.

133
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,211
the brick grains get progressively finer

134
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,878
as you go down the line.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,281
the polishing line processes

136
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,351
about a 10 square feet of granite per minute.

137
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:17,422
for a high-gloss finish, a slab
goes through all 19 heads.

138
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:22,260
for a semigloss finish, it goes through just the first 10 heads.

139
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,837
for a rough finish, slabs skip the polishing line altogether

140
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,574
and instead go through a process
called "flaming."

141
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,444
with a stream of water to keep the slab

142
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,545
from cracking under the heat,

143
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,249
they run a propane flame at 2,000 degrees fahrenheit

144
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,386
across the surface.

145
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,788
this intense heat

146
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,257
makes the quartz inside the granite explode,

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,193
creating a rough surface.

148
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,930
they often use this technique for nonslip flooring.

149
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,134
after the finish,

150
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,072
the last step is to cut the slabs to specifications.

151
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,225
granite is composed of various minerals.

152
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,495
they're interlocked like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle,

153
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,364
giving the stone its trademark speckles

154
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,701
and its remarkable strength.

155
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,243
narrator: they say chips were invented

156
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,446
when someone sent back his fried potatoes,

157
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,515
complaining the slices were too thick.

158
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,051
the insulted chef cut them paper-thin

159
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,786
and fried them to a crisp.

160
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,787
so pride, not necessity,

161
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,557
was the mother of this invention.

162
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,332
potato chips have since become the consummate snack food.

163
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,534
they have to be made with fresh potatoes,

164
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,404
no more than 24 hours old,

165
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,807
otherwise the chips will have black spots.

166
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,876
after a brushing machine removes the dirt,

167
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,714
the potatoes travel along a water canal to the peeler.

168
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,018
they tumble around and around

169
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,687
against the peeler's abrasive rollers

170
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,422
until the skins come off.

171
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:36,594
this machine can peel 12,000 pounds of potatoes per hour.

172
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:46,371
next stop -- a machine that separates the potatoes by size.

173
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,507
the small ones fall below to be rinsed.

174
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,577
the larger ones stay on top to be cut.

175
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,150
then they fall down to the rinser, too.

176
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,498
next, the potatoes go through slicers.

177
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
the slicers' blades are adjustable.

178
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,603
they can be set to different thicknesses

179
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,473
or to different shapes, to slice
ripple chips, for example.

180
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,677
the centrifugal force created by the spinning

181
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,013
throws the potatoes against the sharp blades.

182
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:34,285
to make regular chips, they cut
slices 6/100 of an inch thick.

183
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,256
an average potato will yield about 36 chips.

184
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,229
finally, it's time to wash the potato slices.

185
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,899
they spin inside a giant barrel

186
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,802
of cold, fresh water for about a minute.

187
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,706
then, like at the car wash,

188
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,176
the slices pass under an air blower

189
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,978
to dry up the excess water.

190
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,514
the fryer contains canola oil

191
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:06,584
boiling at 375 degrees fahrenheit.

192
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,853
it takes just 3 minutes

193
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:13,258
to fry the potato slices into potato chips.

194
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,394
as the chips exit the fryer on the conveyor belt,

195
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,096
the excess oil drips off.

196
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,801
next, a shower of salt.

197
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,876
the chips then move on to the sorter.

198
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,945
an electronic camera identifies any chips

199
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,148
that have brown spots or other defects.

200
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,152
the camera then triggers the thin pipe

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,687
directly above that bum chip

202
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,790
to blow it off the conveyor belt
with air pressure.

203
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,628
elsewhere in the factory,

204
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,032
they're making another popular snack food, cheese puffs.

205
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,901
they take corn flour and mix it with water.

206
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,972
an extrusion machine forces the mixture through round holes.

207
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,908
when the snakelike streams come out the other end,

208
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,710
a knife cuts them into pieces.

209
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,311
the heat in the machine

210
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,848
then causes the flour in those pieces to explode,

211
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,650
creating slightly curled puffs.

212
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,520
they spray those puffs with a mixture of canola oil,

213
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,989
powdered cheese, and natural colorings.

214
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,592
a revolving drum mixes it all together.

215
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,735
back in the chips department,

216
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,072
they spray the potato chips with powdered seasonings,

217
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:38,209
which simulate flavors such as barbecue or salt and vinegar.

218
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:49,420
the next machine separates and weighs the portions

219
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,689
to be packaged.

220
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:14,512
the chips drop into bags that are then heat-sealed.

221
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,051
it's taken about 15 minutes

222
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,588
to go from raw potato to potato chips --

223
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,858
a lot longer than it takes to eat them.

224
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,670
narrator: a microprocessor is the brain inside a computer.

225
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,541
its made up of a microchip on an electronic card.

226
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,477
preparing the chip to be installed on the card

227
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,248
is a delicate and precise operation.

228
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:01,091
scientists built the first computer in 1937,

229
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,694
but it could only do algebra.

230
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,365
the first general-purpose computer, in 1946,

231
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,434
was the size of 20 refrigerators.

232
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,905
during the 1950s, transistors replaced bulky vacuum tubes,

233
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,643
then integrated circuits replaced transistors.

234
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,579
but the biggest breakthrough came in 1971

235
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,381
with the microprocessor --

236
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,917
all the components on one miniscule chip.

237
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,521
that's what made the personal computer possible.

238
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,667
they start with a ceramic square
called a substrate.

239
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,470
this will carry the microchip.

240
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,873
a machine coats the substrate surface with flux,

241
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,476
a chemical that makes it sticky.

242
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:55,513
this will hold the microchip in place until it's soldered.

243
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,957
the factory receives the microchips ready-made,

244
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,126
with all the circuits in place.

245
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,199
they place a microchip on each substrate.

246
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,907
an infrared light guides the machine

247
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,544
to place the chip in precisely the right spot.

248
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,657
they pull a sample from the production line

249
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,392
to further verify the positioning

250
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,194
with a microscope.

251
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,668
next stop -- a soldering oven at 689 degrees.

252
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,606
the heat melts tiny beads of tin positioned on the chip,

253
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,075
binding it to the substrate.

254
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,345
next, they prepare to solder an aluminum cap

255
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,814
over each microchip.

256
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,482
the cap will have two functions --

257
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,950
to protect the chip

258
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,488
and to dissipate the heat that the chip generates.

259
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,304
a robotic arm picks up four caps at a time

260
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,541
and positions them over the microchips.

261
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:53,931
they go into a soldering oven at
302 degrees for about an hour.

262
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,536
the next step is to create the electrical connections

263
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,006
that will later link the microprocessor

264
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,275
to the computer's electronic card.

265
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:09,146
they start with tiny cylindrical
pieces of tin, called "columns."

266
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,149
tin conducts electricity.

267
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,952
a giant suctioning sieve vibrates the columns

268
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,154
until they fall through the holes.

269
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,689
this lines them up vertically

270
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,092
so that they can be attached to the substrate.

271
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,698
a machine spreads a thick adhesive paste,

272
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,669
then attaches the vertical columns in it from underneath.

273
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,247
a robotic arm positions the chip-carrying substrate

274
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,949
onto the pasted columns.

275
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:51,656
the result is a microchip with 1,000 connections.

276
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,195
for even more connections,

277
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,598
they use tin balls instead of columns

278
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,400
because balls are sturdier and more reliable.

279
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,270
they, too, go through a suctioning sieve,

280
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,740
only instead of paste, they're stuck on with flux,

281
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,009
that sticky chemical used earlier

282
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,812
to position the microchip onto the substrate.

283
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,626
the finished microchip unit

284
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,163
goes into a bath of water and solvents

285
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,866
to remove any excess flux or other residues.

286
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,844
last stop -- quality control testing,

287
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:52,316
up to 12 hours in an oven heated to 284 degrees.

288
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,520
from here, the microprocessor unit goes to another factory

289
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,056
where it's soldered onto an electronic card,

290
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,393
which then goes into a computer.
