00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:37,689
a computerized system counts the

flats and divvies them up into  
stacks of 200.                  
the flats drop into an elevator

it creates piles that workers

can easily collect.             

301
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,965
it creates piles that workers   
can easily collect.             
they load them into another

00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,367

they load them into another

it moves the flats in a

the factory.                    
it moves the flats in a         
vibrating shuffle up into the

00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:58,644
it moves the flats in a

vibrating shuffle up into the   
cup machine.                    
meanwhile, a roll of paper winds

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,180
cup machine.                    
meanwhile, a roll of paper winds
into the other side of that     

309
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,116
meanwhile, a roll of paper winds
into the other side of that     
machine, where a die punches out

310
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:12,124
into the other side of that     
machine, where a die punches out
bottoms for the paper cups.     

311
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,591
machine, where a die punches out
bottoms for the paper cups.     
this leaves a long strip of     

312
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,059
bottoms for the paper cups.     
this leaves a long strip of

this leaves a long strip of

away for recycling.             

314
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:37,349
meanwhile, the flats are relayed
to a carousel.                  
now the paper cup takes shape.  

315
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,351
to a carousel.                  
now the paper cup takes shape.  
mechanical jaws wrap each flat, 

316
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:47,559
now the paper cup takes shape.  
mechanical jaws wrap each flat, 
and a heat gun seals the seam.  

317
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,361
mechanical jaws wrap each flat, 
and a heat gun seals the seam.  
and now, you have a paper cup   

318
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,964
and a heat gun seals the seam.  
and now, you have a paper cup   
with no bottom.                 

319
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,300
and now, you have a paper cup   
with no bottom.                 
that crucial step comes next.   

320
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:08,780
bottoms are shoved onto the cups
and heat-sealed in place by     
melting the plastic backing on

00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,518
melting the plastic backing on  
the unprinted side of the paper.
the cups then fall down a chute

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,253
the unprinted side of the paper.
the cups then fall down a chute 
to the next operation, which

the cups then fall down a chute

will give the cups a rim and

will give the cups a rim and    
allow you to take a sip without

into ductwork overhead.

00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:35,941
then, the vacuum sucks each cup

each piece of ductwork comes

00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,325
a perfect fold down the middle. 
then, they notch the edges.     
then, they close up the bell by 

396
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,827
then, they notch the edges.     
then, they close up the bell by 
hammering the notched pieces    

397
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,396
then, they close up the bell by 
hammering the notched pieces    
onto the opposite edge.         

398
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,331
hammering the notched pieces    
onto the opposite edge.         
they use a rawhide mallet       

399
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,665
onto the opposite edge.         
they use a rawhide mallet

they use a rawhide mallet

damage the brass.               

401
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,137
because anything harder would   
damage the brass.               
a brass alloy is melted along

403
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:56,707
a brass alloy is melted along

next, the bell goes over a

00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,083
edges.                          
next, the bell goes over a      
cone-shaped mandril where the

00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,151
next, the bell goes over a      
cone-shaped mandril where the   
brass is hammered until it, too,

409
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:13,491
cone-shaped mandril where the   
brass is hammered until it, too,

410
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,126
brass is hammered until it, too,
is cone-shaped.                 
then the bell goes onto another

00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:19,530
is cone-shaped.                 
then the bell goes onto another 
mandril mounted on a lathe.     

412
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,499
then the bell goes onto another 
mandril mounted on a lathe.     
here, the brass cone is refined

00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,968
mandril mounted on a lathe.     
here, the brass cone is refined 
into a more refined shape.      

414
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,938
here, the brass cone is refined 
into a more refined shape.      
then, the metal is filed smooth.

415
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,807
into a more refined shape.      
then, the metal is filed smooth.
now for the bell's rim, called  

416
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,575
then, the metal is filed smooth.
now for the bell's rim, called  
the bead.                       

417
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,743
now for the bell's rim, called  
the bead.                       
a brass rod with a notch at the

00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,478
the bead.                       
a brass rod with a notch at the 
end catches the edge of the bell

419
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,881
a brass rod with a notch at the 
end catches the edge of the bell
and rolls it back into a rim.   

420
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,717
end catches the edge of the bell
and rolls it back into a rim.   
metalworkers use what's called a

and rolls it back into a rim.   
metalworkers use what's called a
concave roller to round the

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,790
metalworkers use what's called a
concave roller to round the     
rim's jagged edge.              

423
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,558
concave roller to round the     
rim's jagged edge.              
then they slide a brass alloy   

424
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,893
rim's jagged edge.              
then they slide a brass alloy   
wire into the rim pocket.       

425
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,462
then they slide a brass alloy   
wire into the rim pocket.       
this makes the bell stronger and

426
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,063
wire into the rim pocket.       
this makes the bell stronger and
adds weight to the edge of the  

427
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,698
this makes the bell stronger and
adds weight to the edge of the  
flare to project the sound      

428
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,069
adds weight to the edge of the

flare to project the sound      
better.                         
they roll the rim over even more

430
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:06,344
better.                         
they roll the rim over even more
to enclose the wire.            

431
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,413
they roll the rim over even more
to enclose the wire.            
now they heat the rim and apply 

432
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,381
to enclose the wire.            
now they heat the rim and apply 
acid flux to clean the surface  

433
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,417
now they heat the rim and apply 
acid flux to clean the surface  
for soldering.

00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,830
after wiping off the excess

444
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,809
workers smooth away any

then, they remove any solder    

445
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,712
scratches left by the scraper.  
then, they remove any solder    
bits trapped in the rim.

00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,780
then, they remove any solder    
bits trapped in the rim.        
now, the entire bell is filled

now, the entire bell is filled  
with a soapy solution.

00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,118
now, the entire bell is filled  
with a soapy solution.          
then, it's frozen at minus 56
