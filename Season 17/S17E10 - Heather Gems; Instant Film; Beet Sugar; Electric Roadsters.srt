17
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,756
have veinlike patterns created

an hour while tiny iron pellets 
blast the heather inside.       

30
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,579
an hour while tiny iron pellets 
blast the heather inside.       
the pellets chip away the bark  

31
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,247
blast the heather inside.       
the pellets chip away the bark  
and remove the foliage.         

32
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,116
the pellets chip away the bark

00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,917
and remove the foliage.         
the heather comes out of the    
machine as bare, dried-out,     

34
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,918
the heather comes out of the    
machine as bare, dried-out,

00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,924
delicate wood.                  
workers form 1 1/2-pound bundles
and place them in a vacuum-die  

37
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:07,225
workers form 1 1/2-pound bundles
and place them in a vacuum-die  
chamber for two whole days.     

38
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,227
and place them in a vacuum-die  
chamber for two whole days.     
first, the vacuum draws out the 

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,063
chamber for two whole days.     
first, the vacuum draws out the 
air in the stems to clear the   

40
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:14,466
first, the vacuum draws out the 
air in the stems to clear the   
way for the die to penetrate.   

41
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,002
air in the stems to clear the   
way for the die to penetrate.   
then, again under pressure, the 

42
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:25,611
way for the die to penetrate.   
then, again under pressure, the 
stems slowly absorb the dye.    

43
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,479
then, again under pressure, the 
stems slowly absorb the dye.    
this vacuum method is far more  

44
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,081
stems slowly absorb the dye.    
this vacuum method is far more  
effective than dipping or       

45
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,016
this vacuum method is far more  
effective than dipping or       
soaking the stems in vats of dye

46
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,718
effective than dipping or       
soaking the stems in vats of dye
because the color penetrates    

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,152
soaking the stems in vats of dye
because the color penetrates    
deeply into the heather wood    

48
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,620
because the color penetrates    
deeply into the heather wood    
rather than merely sitting on   

49
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,758
deeply into the heather wood    
rather than merely sitting on   
the surface.                    

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,060
rather than merely sitting on   
the surface.                    
they open the bundles and make  

51
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,163
the surface.                    
they open the bundles and make  
new ones of the same weight,    

52
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,231
they open the bundles and make  
new ones of the same weight,    
this time combining colors.     

53
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,933
new ones of the same weight,    
this time combining colors.     
it's important to combine       

54
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,968
this time combining colors.     
it's important to combine       
thicker stems with thinner ones 

55
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,904
it's important to combine       
thicker stems with thinner ones 
to create contrasting lines in  

56
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,806
thicker stems with thinner ones 
to create contrasting lines in  
the gem pattern.                

57
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:07,819
next, they soak each bundle in  
epoxy resin for two or three    
minutes, ensuring the stems are 

58
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,488
epoxy resin for two or three    
minutes, ensuring the stems are 
well saturated.                 

59
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:27,305
then they place the bundles on  
racks to allow the excess resin 
to drain off.                   

60
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,408
racks to allow the excess resin 
to drain off.                   
they load four bundles between  

61
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,009
to drain off.                   
they load four bundles between  
the top and bottom halves of a  

62
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,246
they load four bundles between  
the top and bottom halves of a  
mold.                           

63
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,615
the top and bottom halves of a  
mold.                           
a press then slowly closes the  

64
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,751
mold.                           
a press then slowly closes the  
mold, applying 88 tons of       

65
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,653
a press then slowly closes the  
mold, applying 88 tons of       
pressure for about a minute.    

66
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:03,375
they clamp the mold closed and  
remove it from the press.       
then they put the mold into an  

67
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,910
remove it from the press.       
then they put the mold into an  
oven for an hour to cure the    

68
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:10,382
then they put the mold into an  
oven for an hour to cure the    
resin.                          

69
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,284
oven for an hour to cure the    
resin.                          
they open the mold and remove   

70
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,786
resin.                          
they open the mold and remove   
what is now a rock-hard,        

71
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,654
they open the mold and remove   
what is now a rock-hard,        
resin-bonded block of heather   

72
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,724
what is now a rock-hard,        
resin-bonded block of heather   
wood.                           

73
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,692
resin-bonded block of heather   
wood.                           
they put the block on a band saw

74
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:24,930
wood.                           
they put the block on a band saw
and trim off the rough edges.   

75
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,666
they put the block on a band saw
and trim off the rough edges.   
they cut slices between 4/10 and

76
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,601
and trim off the rough edges.   
they cut slices between 4/10 and
5/10 of an inch thick, depending

96
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,527
finally, they glue each gem onto

sometimes they dye the heather  

97
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,961
the jewelry or gift item.       
sometimes they dye the heather  
just a single color.            

98
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,930
sometimes they dye the heather  
just a single color.            
this still produces a striking

they add carbon dioxide to the  
lime milk-and-juice mixture.    

350
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,680
they add carbon dioxide to the

low-voltage systems, like the   
lights and fans.                

512
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,550
low-voltage systems, like the   
lights and fans.                
and now the brains of the       

513
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,885
lights and fans.                
and now the brains of the       
electric car -- the             

514
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,887
and now the brains of the       
electric car -- the             
power-electronics module.       

515
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,822
electric car -- the             
power-electronics module.       
they install it on top of the   

516
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,858

motor and battery and wire it to
both.                           
with all the wires connected,   

519
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,162
both.                           
with all the wires connected,   
the module is equipped to       

520
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,564
with all the wires connected,   
the module is equipped to       
convert dc power from the       

521
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,166
the module is equipped to       
convert dc power from the       
battery to the ac power.        

522
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,301
convert dc power from the       
battery to the ac power.        
it will then supply that current

523
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,503
battery to the ac power.        
it will then supply that current
to the motor as the driver steps

524
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,572
it will then supply that current
to the motor as the driver steps
on the accelerator.             

525
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,441
to the motor as the driver steps
on the accelerator.             
with the vacuum system, they    

526
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,443
on the accelerator.             
with the vacuum system, they    
drain air from the battery and  

527
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,844
with the vacuum system, they    
drain air from the battery and  
pump in liquid coolant.         

528
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,445
drain air from the battery and  
pump in liquid coolant.         
coolant continuously flows      

529
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,248
pump in liquid coolant.         
coolant continuously flows      
through the battery to maintain 

530
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,151
coolant continuously flows      
through the battery to maintain 
an even temperature throughout. 

531
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,853
the body panels are made of     

532
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,487
durable, lightweight carbon     

533
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,989
fiber.                          

534
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,724
and with the computer software  

535
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,092
updated and the car now         

536
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,795
completely assembled, it's time 

537
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,531
for a test run.                 

538
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,499
as the sports car accelerates,  

539
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,100
there's no throaty roar.        

540
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,203
unlike a gas-powered engine, the

541
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,205
electric motor takes of quietly 

542
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,040
and quickly.
