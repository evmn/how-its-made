00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,922
narrator: indycars are open-cockpit race cars    

4
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,591
that compete in the annual indianapolis 500 race              

5
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,058
in the u.s.           

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,995
the cars are entirely custom-built.    

7
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,398
even the driver's seat is specially contoured      

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,132
to the driver's body shape    

9
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,267
and position in which he or she sits          

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,337
most comfortably in the car.   

11
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,077
the custom-made driver's seat in an indycar          

12
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,748
is made of fire-resistant fabric over impact-absorbing foam.   

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,283
it has openings         
at the shoulder, lap, and legs  

14
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,153
for the safety harness.     

15
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:30,623
to make the seat, they first have to produce a template,   

16
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,960
which is, in itself, a two-day process.        

17
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,628
technicians prepare,       

18
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,332
then pour an adhesive into a bag full of foam beads.    

19
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:44,470
the adhesive contains resin and a hardener.      

20
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,175
once the adhesive seeps in,   

21
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:53,112
they squeeze out the air and tie the bag closed.     

22
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,052
they knead the bag to spread the adhesive      

23
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,588
over all the foam beads inside.             

24
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,996
next, laying the bag flat,    

25
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:12,397
they spread the adhesive-saturated beads   

26
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,067
in an even layer.        

27
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,871
then they install a valve...   

28
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,339
attach it to a vacuum pump,   

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,210
and suction out most of the remaining air.    

30
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,548
they shape a cavity in the middle to fit the driver's body.              

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,484
once they vacuumed out enough air to make the bag tight enough             

32
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,920
to hold the shape of this cavity...        

33
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,291
...they place it in the race car's cockpit,    

34
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,228
pressing the foam beads as snugly as possible      

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,296
into all the nooks and crannies.            

36
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,965
this ensures          
the car seat will fit properly  

37
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,034
and not shift under the driver.             

38
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,303
the driver now has to sit in the car      

39
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,638
so they can custom-contour the template   

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,775
to his body in the driving position.     

41
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,913
once he's settled comfortably  
with hips and shoulders square  

42
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,382
and wearing his helmet,     

43
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,383
they begin taking measurements,          

44
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,987
starting with the height of his head, critical for aerodynamics,          

45
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,257
and of his sight line over   
the hood, critical for safety.  

46
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,126
both measurements must conform  

47
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,596
with the racing association's strict regulations.       

48
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,864
they also measure the distance  

49
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,467
between his chest and the steering wheel      

50
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:24,069
and ensure           
there's adequate leg clearance  

51
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,271
to enter and exit the cockpit.  

52
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:30,208
the driver sits down, gets out, gets back in      

53
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,077
several times          

54
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,747
as the technicians measure and make adjustments.      

55
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:38,350
the entire process takes about 40 minutes.     

56
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,620
when it's all done, they run the vacuum for another four hours  

57
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,623
and let the foam cure overnight.           

58
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,225
the next morning,        

59
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:49,094
they use a hot knife to melt a line through the foam              

60
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,764
and dislodge the template from the cockpit.        

61
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:55,434
the driver returns for a final two- to three-hour sitting,   

62
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,303
during which the techs trim the foam as closely as possible            

63
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,906
to his body contour.       

64
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,445
the shape now finalized, they cover the entire surface  

65
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,582
with cloth adhesive tape and a matte finish.       

66
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:12,184
this creates a non-reflective background   

67
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,720
suitable for laser scanning.   

68
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,458
onto this dull surface,     

69
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,794
they adhere positioning targets --      

70
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,463
reflective dots spaced four inches apart     

71
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,633
that create a grid pattern over the entire template.    

72
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:35,741
the 3-d laser scanner      
reads these reflective dots...  

73
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,717
...that a computer translates into a 3-d image.        

74
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,555
specialized software then converts this image     

75
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,157
into a technical drawing,    

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,226
which guides an automated router             

77
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:57,296
to cut the seat parts out of polypropylene foam.    

78
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,734
this precision-cutting process takes four to six hours.     

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,241
the router cuts out six to eight sections,      

80
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,577
which technicians then carefully glue together   

81
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,713
into the full seat.       

82
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,326
they cover the finished seat in fire-retardant material,   

83
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,330
first applying the fabric with spray adhesive,       

84
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,033
then trimming it to the shape of the seat.    

85
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,603
this foam is quite elastic,   

86
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,273
so it absorbs impact and protects the driver.     

87
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,409
at the same time, it has memory,             

88
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:48,647
so after a blow, it regains its driver-customized shape.   

89
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,097
narrator: people have always been enchanted          

90
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,033
by the beauty of flowers.    

91
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,903
it's not surprising that these jewels of nature,   

92
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,904
often in artificial form,    

93
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:17,442
are used in decorative objects and arts and crafts projects.  

94
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,378
paper flowers last forever,   

95
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,815
and you don't have to remember to water them.     

96
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,786
these flowers are made of saa paper.      

97
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,188
the saa tree is a variety of mulberry     

98
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,659
that grows abundantly across southeast asia.      

99
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:37,596
for more than 700 years,    
villagers in northern thailand  

100
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,666
have been using saa bark to make paper.          

101
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,801
the paper is used for crafting items        

102
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:46,472
such as umbrellas, fans, and flowers.        

103
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,940
they soak the dried bark in water overnight        

104
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,943
to begin softening it up,    

105
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,545
boil it over a wood fire for four hours,         

106
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,814
then soak it again overnight.  

107
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:59,752
all of this softens the bark into fibrous pulp.        

108
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,420
next, they soak the pulp overnight   

109
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,691
in hydrogen peroxide to whiten it,          

110
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,492
then they rinse off the bleach,             

111
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,829
which would interfere with the dying process later on.   

112
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,832
workers discard any discolored pieces.      

113
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,703
the goal is to make each sheet of paper evenly white   

114
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,907
so that it absorbs colored dye uniformly.            

115
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,576
now they load the pulp into a mill,           

116
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,546
which grinds it up and mixes it with water.     

117
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,254
this process, which takes about half an hour,              

118
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,659
transforms the pieces into soft,             
fluffy, and very soggy fibers.  

119
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,267
what was once tree bark     

120
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:52,404
is now ready to be processed into paper.   

121
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,741
every single sheet        

122
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,677
is handcrafted on fine mesh screens.      

123
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,545
they submerge a screen in water,             

124
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,149
then drop in roughly 15 ounces of fibers.       

125
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,885
they manually stir the water to spread the fibers       

126
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,455
in a thin layer across the screen.        

127
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,225
they slowly lift the screen out of the water         

128
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,229
and press the surface by hand to smooth it out.        

129
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:21,500
the screen then stands in the sun for three to four hours,   

130
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,968
flipped a few times       

131
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,372
until the fiber's dry into a solid sheet of paper.   

132
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,640
to color the paper,       

133
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,577
they fill a basin with hot water and add a chemical dye.     

134
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,046
they test the color,       

135
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:37,115
and if it's just right, they submerge the sheet.     

136
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,117
the sheet absorbs the dye instantly            

137
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,922
in a consistent shade thanks to the uniformly white base color.             

138
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:49,094
they hang the sheet outside to dry in the sun.        

139
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:54,800
in three to four hours, the paper is ready to bloom.   

140
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,805
they cut out flower shapes with a hand-operated press    

141
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,809
that stamps a sharp metal dye through the sheet of paper.   

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,549
each shape will be a layer of petals in a flower.      

143
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:15,220
there are dyes in various shapes and sizes.   

144
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,423
however, the petals they produce are flat --           

145
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,892
not very lifelike --       

146
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:23,628
so workers place one petal at  
a time on a flower-shaped mold  

147
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,497
and stamp it with a hot press.  

148
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,899
this permanently shapes the petals            

149
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,634
to the contour of the mold    

150
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,038
almost the same way a hot iron presses clothes.   

151
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,576
then it's assembly time.     

152
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,913
to make a rose, they mount a white ball made of foam,    

153
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,181
or flower and glue,       

154
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,649
onto the end of a three-inch-long wire.    

155
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,185
they fold the inner petals over the ball          

156
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,322
and pinch them together to   
create the center of the rose.  

157
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,391
then they thread four to five petal layers of the same size  

158
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,193
on the wire,           

159
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,831
bending and pinching those, as well, to form the rose shape.             

160
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,204
once the petals are complete,  

161
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:08,707
they finish off with a green paper leaf at the base.              

162
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,616
to make a daisy, they take a flat flower     

163
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,485
and glue a brown paper dot in the middle.          

164
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,689
then they glue another flat flower beneath it      

165
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,492
and a leaf base beneath that.  

166
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,168
to make another type of rose,  

167
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,138
they gently twist the tips of the petals.     

168
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,510
even though they're made from trees,     

169
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,780
these artificial flowers are environmentally friendly.  

170
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:53,118
the saa's severed branches and stripped bark grow back quickly,            

171
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,054
providing a renewable supply of raw material         

172
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:59,391
for crafting blooming paper bouquets.     

173
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,876
narrator: weather-wise, these are turbulent times.    

174
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,212
there are more storms and heat waves,         

175
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:23,682
and that means an increased likelihood of power outages.   

176
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,419
a standby generator       
supplies emergency electricity  

177
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,554
within seconds of an outage   

178
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:33,058
so a homeowner can       
ride out the storm in comfort.  

179
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,963
in today's high-tech world,   

180
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,566
staying plugged in       
has never been more important.  

181
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,368
wired to a home's electrical system,   

182
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,371
a standby generator automatically powers up     

183
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,172
in the event of an outage.    

184
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,175
it assumes the electrical load  

185
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,511
until the public-utilities system comes back online.    

186
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,546
with your own standby generator,           

187
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,584
a power outage is never a crisis.        

188
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,719
production starts with a stator.          

189
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,622
it's the stationary core of the alternator --       

190
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,326
the part that converts energy  
from the motor to electricity.  

191
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,929
a press compacts 100 or more laminated steel disks      

192
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,066
to create the stator core.    

193
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:18,337
machinery unwinds steel banding and wraps it around the stack  

194
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,440
to hold the core layers together.            

195
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,680
machinery lifts the stator core out of the assembly device    

196
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,850
and transfers it to the next station.       

197
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,759
here, an automated system    

198
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,297
insulates the numerous slots in the core.           

199
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,967
as the core turns, a machine cuts, forms, and inserts     

200
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,772
synthetic insulating fabric into each slot.         

201
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,178
meanwhile, at another station,  

202
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,249
an automated system winds copper wire onto a mandrel.   

203
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,920
the slots in the mandrel are the same size        

204
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,590
as the insulated slots in the core.           

205
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:17,662
this configures the copper windings to fit the core slots.             

206
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,799
but first, a technician slides the copper coils     

207
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,068
onto a threading tool.      

208
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,407
this tool maintains       
the configuration of the coils  

209
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,844
to prepare them for installation in the stator core.       

210
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:38,050
they wind more bundles of copper wire.         

211
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,688
once all the windings have been correctly arranged   

212
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,023
on the threading tool,      

213
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,958
the technician is ready to transfer them    

214
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,694
to the stator core.       

215
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,766
he places the stator on top of the threading tool   

216
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,235
and activates a hydraulic device             

217
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,771
that pushes the wires up through the tool       

218
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,107
and into the slots of the stator core.       

219
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,312
the device retracts, and he removes the stator.    

220
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:11,783
the copper wires transform the stator into an electromagnet,  

221
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,519
which is critical for electrical generation.    

222
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,654
he trims the ends of the wires  

223
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,058
and sets the leftovers aside for recycling.          

224
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,797
he slides insulating sleeves onto the ends.          

225
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:32,069
then it's into the lacing machine.       

226
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,940
this machine crochets a string wrap around the bundles             

227
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,677
to hold the wires together.   

228
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,746
it also pulls in any loose strands        

229
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,948
to keep them from snagging on generator components.     

230
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,285
with the wiring precisely wound and wrapped,   

231
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,888
this important generator component       

232
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,023
is ready for the finishing touch --    

233
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,892
a clear varnish.         

234
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,229
the lid closes on the tank, and a vacuum pulls air out.   

235
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,901
the tank then fills with clear varnish to coat the stators.   

236
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:07,705
the varnish fills in any gaps in the windings.         

237
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,709
they transfer the stators to an oven and bake on the varnish.            

238
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,447
once hardened, the varnish   
insulates the entire assembly.  

239
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,720
the next technician       
connects the stator lead wires  

240
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,124
to a testing machine.      

241
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,528
the machine applies high-voltage pulses to the wire windings   

242
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,330
and monitors the output     

243
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,867
for anything that could cause generator failure.     

244
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,437
the stator passes the test.   

245
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,542
a technician now positions   
an outer casing and an end cap  

246
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,942
on top of the stator,      

247
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,312
followed by a steel pressing plate.     

248
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,151
a hydraulic arm then provides the muscle power needed     

249
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,655
to fit the casing and cap snugly to the stator.          

250
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,826
coming up next,         

251
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:03,962
the generator stator joins the rotor and engine,   

252
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,098
and the result is purely electric.       

253
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,385
narrator: the average home may contain   

254
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,322
over 100 electrical appliances and devices.           

255
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,191
when there's a power blackout, everything shuts down.      

256
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:36,862
a standby generator restores electricity in seconds             

257
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,998
to keep the refrigerator running and the heat on.         

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,369
in an extended power outage, a generator can be a life saver.             

259
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,074
to produce the alternator's rotating part, the rotor,    

260
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,144
the technician stacks laminated steel disks   

261
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,081
to the same height as the stator core.       

262
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:00,218
he lubricates the opening in the center of the disks.   

263
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,819
he inserts a shaft,       

264
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,489
and a press pushes it into the stack          

265
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,426
to complete the installation.  

266
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:13,765
powered by the generator engine,            
the shaft will spin the rotor.  

267
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,767
the technician installs steel rods       

268
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,169
to maintain the disks' alignment            

269
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,373
and then removes the rotor from the assembly device.    

270
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,243
he fits more rods to it on a slight angle.        

271
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,378
they'll act as conductors    

272
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,782
and stabilize          
the rotor's electrical output.  

273
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:35,720
he slides aluminum caps onto both ends of the rotor.   

274
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,457
then it's over to an automated welder.     

275
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,461
the machine grips the rotor at both ends           

276
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,862
and slowly turns it       

277
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:48,066
as a robot welds both caps to the rotor body.        

278
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:55,173
welded in place, the caps secure the aluminum rods.    

279
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,343
the aluminum solder used in the weld         

280
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,681
is conductive and will create an electrical connection.    

281
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,552
the technician unclamps the   
rotor from the welding machine  

282
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,755
and then tucks insulation into slots on the sides.     

283
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,825
the rotor then goes for a spin  

284
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,896
in a machine that winds bands of copper wire              

285
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,231
around the insulated sections.  

286
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,234
these wires will act as electromagnets    

287
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,303
and help produce electrical current.   

288
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,907
they tie string around the wire,              

289
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,910
add bearings and a copper collector ring,   

290
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:35,714
and bake an insulating varnish onto the entire rotor.      

291
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:39,717
they're now ready to assemble the standby generator.      

292
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:44,322
using a lift, the technician lowers the engine into position.            

293
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:48,259
he joins the rotor shaft to the engine crankshaft.    

294
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,200
to secure the assembly, he drives a very long bolt    

295
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,268
through the rotor to the crankshaft        

296
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,938
and tightens it to a specific torque.      

297
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,540
next up is the stator.      

298
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,742
it will provide a magnetic field              

299
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:09,014
to advance the flow of electrons in the rotor.          

300
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:12,717
the technician slides the stator onto the rotor.         

301
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,755
a steel end bracket is next.   

302
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,158
it aligns the rotor and the stator.         

303
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,498
he forces the bracket into place.           

304
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,104
to secure the alignment, he installs four long bolts   

305
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:37,842
from the end bracket to the engine-adapter plate.   

306
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,445
he anchors the stator and rotor to the generator base      

307
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,982
and adds special rubber mounts under the supports        

308
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,317
to buffer vibrations.      

309
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,520
he attaches a motorized carbon brush     

310
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,790
to copper rings on the rotor shaft.       

311
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,526
the brush will collect electricity from the shaft    

312
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,462
and transfer it to the generator controller.   

313
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,799
he secures it to the end bracket with screws.           

314
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,334
he connects the wiring harness  

315
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:07,138
that moves electricity from the brush to the controller.   

316
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,311
he links the other end of the harness to the engine.  

317
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,818
he plugs in a sensor to monitor oil pressure     

318
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,887
and makes all the other electrical connections.     

319
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:31,029
next up is a panel through which he runs some of the wiring.   

320
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:33,698
it acts as a separator to prevent entanglements     

321
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,468
and also supports the fuel regulator.       

322
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,175
other parts include a muffler to help dampen engine noise   

323
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:47,378
and a controller that converts generated power  

324
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,114
to the correct voltage.     

325
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,052
the assembly of this      
standby generator is complete.  

326
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,588
the technician fuels up     

327
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,191
and runs it first at partial capacity,       

328
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,128
then to the max.         

329
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,264
the test confirms there's no  
wavering in electrical output.  

330
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,467
once encased           

331
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,537
in a neutral-colored corrosion-resistant shell,    

332
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:17,208
the standby generator blends into the background,   

333
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,010
but in a power outage,      

334
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:22,347
its contribution will definitely be noticed.   

335
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,958
