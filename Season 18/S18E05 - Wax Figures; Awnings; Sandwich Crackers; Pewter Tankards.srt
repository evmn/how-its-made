1
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:53,519
            narrator:           
   we can't all rub shoulders   

2
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,588
      with political greats     
        and movie stars.        

3
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,457
 but for the price of admission 
      to a wax attraction,      

4
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,193
        anyone can mingle       
    with their wax replicas.    

5
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,796
        these look-alikes       
  aren't much for conversation, 

6
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,998
        but the likeness        
        can be startling,       

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,235
       thanks to a process      
      honed over centuries.     

8
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,874
          famous faces          
    come to life in beeswax,    

9
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,878
 so it's almost like seeing them
          in the flesh.         

10
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,279
     but how do they do it?     

11
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,748
         it often starts        
   with a face-to-face meeting  

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,416
        with the subject,       
     during which they take     

13
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,486
   more than 200 measurements   
        of the face alone       

14
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,488
   and still more of the body.  

15
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,090
  drawing on those measurements 

16
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,826
        and using photos        
    and additional research,    

17
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:37,295
  an artist sculpts a clay body 
     onto a metal skeleton.     

18
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,366
       this clay sculpture      
  will be used to make a mold.  

19
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,301
      the head, of course,      
   receives special attention.  

20
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,506
    they sculpt it in stages,   
 and this takes about six weeks.

21
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,242
      to check the symmetry     
     of the sculptured face,    

22
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:53,712
  the artist stretches a wire   
  from the temple to the chin.  

23
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:57,182
 she measures it from all angles
    and compares the numbers    

24
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,519
         to measurements        
     of the actual subject.     

25
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,954
       every single aspect      
        of the clay face        

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,591
        must mirror that        
   of the subject's precisely   

27
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:09,528
  so if it's even slightly off, 
     she makes adjustments.     

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,298
  here, she redefines the teeth 
           a bit more.          

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,769
            and then            
    she tweaks the hairline.    

30
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,875
        they're now ready       
      for the next step --      

31
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,810
  the making of the head mold.  

32
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,680
    the worker paints plaster   
       onto the sculpture       

33
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:29,148
    in 14 different sections.   

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,483
      this multi-part mold      

35
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,018
      can be easily removed     
       from the clay head       

36
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,121
     once the plaster dries.    

37
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:41,026
       after the clay head      
       has been discarded,      

38
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,297
 they give the reassembled mold 
         a quick rinse.         

39
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,434
    the wax artist turns the    
  plaster head mold upside down 

40
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,636
and slots it into the wax bench,

41
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:55,640
   so named because it secures  
the mold during the wax casting.

42
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,110
            they melt           
   blocks of japanese beeswax   

43
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,712
    and funnel the liquid wax   

44
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,180
          into the neck         
      of the plaster cast.      

45
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,050
  they let it set for an hour,  

46
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:07,052
        just long enough        
     for the wax to solidify    

47
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,322
     and form a thick crust     
 around the inside of the cast. 

48
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,724
           the artist           
    removes crust at the neck   

49
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,060
          and pours out         
      the rest of the wax,      

50
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,730
             leaving            
    a hollow wax face inside.   

51
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:21,901
  they set it aside for another 
    hour to further solidify.   

52
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,672
         the wax artist         
    removes the plaster mold    

53
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,008
     and comes face to face     
     with the wax creation.     

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,210
   she examines it thoroughly,  

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,080
           confirming           
  that the detail from the mold 

56
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,214
has been effectively transferred
           to the wax           

57
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,549
      and that the wax face     

58
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,352
        is a dead ringer        
     for the human subject.     

59
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,288
          the team then         
  casts the wax figure's hands, 

60
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,425
          and an artist         
 matches the subject's skin tone

61
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,026
        against a chart.        

62
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,896
         she mixes paint        
    and dabs the brush in it.   

63
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,365
   she then strikes her brush   
        with another one        

64
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,768
     so the paint splatters     
        across the hand.        

65
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,036
     she blots up the paint     
         to blend it in.        

66
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,639
         this technique         
  gives the wax a speckled look 

67
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,376
    that mimics human pores.    

68
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,180
 she paints on knuckles, veins, 
    and distinctive markings    

69
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,916
         to mimic those         
     on the subject's hands.    

70
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,985
 she gives the nails a manicure 

71
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:17,189
        to make the hands       
look identical to the subject's.

72
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,391
          in the hands          
      of a skilled artist,      

73
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,461
         these wax hands        
       have come to life.       

74
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,597
  as a medical glass eye spins, 

75
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,868
       the artist blots on      
     a very wide pupil first    

76
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,671
  and then paints the periphery 
   to mimic the person's iris.  

77
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,808
     iris color and pattern     
  are unique to the individual, 

78
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,477
         and the artist         
   replicates those qualities   

79
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,746
     as closely as possible.    

80
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,419
   she glues red silk threads   
   onto the whites of the eyes  

81
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,289
           to simulate          
      broken blood vessels.     

82
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,758
 it's another touch of realism. 

83
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,966
 they slot the eyes into sockets
        in the wax head.        

84
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,969
       then the wax figure      
    is ready for its hair --    

85
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,239
        actual human hair       
    matched to the subject's.   

86
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,241
       they pierce the wax      
        with a hot needle       

87
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,844
            to insert           
     each hair individually.    

88
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,914
          the wax melts         
   and closes around the hair.  

89
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,449
          this process          
      can take four weeks.      

90
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,052
        they also plug in       
        brows and lashes        

91
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,922
     and then brush on paint    
          like makeup.          

92
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:26,725
with his face on, the wax figure
     now looks true to life.    

93
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,860
         once completed,        

94
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,663
           wax figures          
    get movie-star treatment.   

95
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,365
      their hair is washed      
      and styled regularly,     

96
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,202
       and their clothing       
    is routinely dry-cleaned.   

97
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,137
  after all, even wax versions  
        of famous people        

98
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,907
  have to keep up appearances.  

99
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,955
            narrator:           
    the unfurling of awnings    

100
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,557
          usually marks         
  the roll-out of patio season. 

101
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,427
 it's a long tradition, one that
 actually dates back centuries. 

102
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,630
          early romans          
      were among the first      

103
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,900
 to seek refuge from the hot sun
      under fabric awnings.     

104
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,768
  and today, design innovations 

105
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,872
       mean there's always      
  something new under the sun.  

106
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,443
     with modern mechanisms,    

107
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,178
       unfolding an awning      
     has never been easier.     

108
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,650
   this manual crank system is  
 designed for a smooth roll-out.

109
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,585
   and for extra convenience,   

110
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:31,724
   there are motorized awnings  
   operated by remote control.  

111
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,859
        production begins       
        with the fabric,        

112
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,062
     which comes in a range     
of weather-resistant synthetics.

113
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,866
the seamstress cuts out patterns
   from thick acrylic material  

114
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,734
  and sews the pieces together. 

115
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,804
        here she works on       
   the awning's front valance.  

116
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,407
         a roller keeps         
  the fabric correctly aligned  

117
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,944
          and stops it          
  from bunching up as she sews. 

118
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:55,547
          she stitches          
 a long pocket along the border.

119
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,417
    a plastic rod will later    
    be channeled through it     

120
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,387
     to connect the valance     
    to the awning framework.    

121
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,494
   she traces a scalloped edge  
 onto the bottom of the valance 

122
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:12,631
       and then carefully       
  cuts along the penciled line. 

123
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,701
 with a steady hand, she follows
      the outline precisely     

124
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:20,072
    to give the valance those   
 distinctive curves and notches.

125
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,910
             workers            
 then position the awning panel 

126
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,511
  in front of an aluminum tube. 

127
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,980
           they thread          
 the pocketed end of the awning 

128
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,582
   into a channel in the tube   

129
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,585
  and then slide a plastic rod  
        into the pocket.        

130
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,855
      this secures the end      
   of the fabric to the tube.   

131
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,459
  it takes two people to avoid  
  any buckling of the fabric.   

132
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,465
    they insert a plastic cap   
    into one end of the tube    

133
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,935
but leave the other end open for
 the installation of the motor. 

134
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,605
 they now wind the awning panel 
        around the tube,        

135
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,073
   synchronizing their efforts  

136
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,710
   so the tension in the roll   
     is equal at both ends.     

137
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,681
       next, rollers carry      
     a squared aluminum tube    

138
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,517
       to a circular saw.       

139
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,291
        once in position,       
arms descend to steady the tube,

140
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:15,427
     and the saw slices it      
     to the correct length.     

141
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,296
          the cut tube          
    will be the carrier bar,    

142
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,366
        an important part       
    of the awning framework.    

143
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,302
            a worker            
   now builds that framework,   

144
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,304
 starting with the carrier bar. 

145
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:28,306
       he slides a bracket      
      partway down the tube     

146
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,710
           and uses it          
 to attach the retractable arms,

147
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,580
      securing the assembly     
  with a heavy-duty steel pin.  

148
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,918
           two workers          
     slide connector pieces     

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
        into the grooves        
        in the drop bar         

150
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,589
        for the valance.        

151
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,793
     then they raise the bar    
and attach the retractable arms.

152
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:54,466
   they install a side bearing  
in the end of the connector bar.

153
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,537
    it's one of two that will   
 support the awning's main tube.

154
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,574
             next up            
  is that fabric-wrapped tube.  

155
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,145
 they attach it to the framework

156
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,480
     and tuck the other end     
      of the awning fabric      

157
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,149
        into a round slot       
        in the drop bar.        

158
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,018
           they slide           
    another long plastic rod    

159
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,088
        through a pocket        
   in the fabric to secure it.  

160
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,757
they're now ready for the motor.

161
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,760
      it's a tubular model.     

162
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,162
   he attaches a metal bracket  

163
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:26,364
    for assembling the motor    
     to the main framework.     

164
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,035
he then equips the tubular motor
     with two plastic rings,    

165
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,237
        one at each end.        

166
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,706
      powered by the motor,     

167
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,710
    these rings will revolve    
  to open and close the awning. 

168
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:42,881
         a test confirms        
  that it's fully operational.  

169
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:52,057
he slides the tubular motor into
the open end of the awning tube.

170
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:58,730
   he attaches the second side  
 bearing to the metal bracket...

171
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,203
           ...and caps          
  the open end of the drop bar. 

172
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,675
    a few taps with a hammer    
    drives it down the shaft.   

173
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,076
     he now tests the awning    

174
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,380
         to confirm that        
everything unfolds as it should.

175
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,484
    he tightens some screws.    

176
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,753
            and when            
   it's perfectly operational,  

177
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,156
   he'll install the valance.   

178
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:34,032
    it takes about an hour to   
 manufacture a motorized awning,

179
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,538
      and it should supply      
    about a decade of shade.    

180
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,190
            narrator:           
        sandwich crackers       

181
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,392
           are one of           
  life's little conveniences -- 

182
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,728
crispy wafers with peanut butter
 or cheese spread between them, 

183
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,797
         all wrapped up         
       in a neat package.       

184
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,467
in north america, factories have
been mass-producing these snacks

185
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,870
      since the early part      
      of the 20th century       

186
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,373
 to satisfy the need to nibble. 

187
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:22,347
 sandwich crackers come in handy
       for a quick refuel.      

188
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,952
   just unwrap and snack while  
   continuing on your routine.  

189
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,355
   they start with the smaller  
   ingredients for the dough,   

190
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:35,026
   which include baking soda,   
   a powdered cheese additive,  

191
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,561
    and a kind of phosphate,    

192
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,365
  which, like the baking soda,  
      is a leavening agent.     

193
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,101
     next are enzyme tablets    
         and the yeast,         

194
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,438
    two ingredients that will   
later cause the dough to ferment

195
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,107
      to give the crackers      
       textural strength.       

196
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,442
         they add water         

197
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,912
 and thicken the liquefied blend
      with a little flour.      

198
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:57,449
      this makes it easier      
  to pump into the next mixer.  

199
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,919
    this one is a big trough    
         full of flour.         

200
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,520
    they add ice to chill it    

201
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,257
        and then pipe in        
   the small-ingredient blend.  

202
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,791
    cooling the mix with ice    

203
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,395
 preserves the yeast and enzymes
  to hold off on fermentation.  

204
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,331
         if fermentation        
        happens too soon,       

205
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,734
  the dough could turn to mush. 

206
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,804
    they lower a lid equipped   
   with three spiraling blades  

207
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,339
  and set the blades in motion, 

208
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:22,741
      pumping in more water     
     to augment the moisture    

209
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,277
      from the melting ice      
   and small-ingredient blend.  

210
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,082
it's now ready for fermentation,
    so it's into a warm room    

211
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,218
           to activate          
   the yeast and the enzymes.   

212
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,752
        the dough swells,       

213
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,623
  and a worker breaks the crust 
         to release gas.        

214
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,894
    an automated system tips    
the trough of dough into a chute

215
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,231
  that takes it one floor down  
     to the rolling station.    

216
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,234
      the chemical changes      
     caused by fermentation     

217
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,569
      have made this dough      
          less sticky,          

218
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,304
          so it can now         
      be rolled into sheets     

219
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,174
        without adhering        
        to the equipment.       

220
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,443
            the dough           
   now travels between rollers  

221
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,780
 that flatten it and squeeze it 
    to a specific thickness.    

222
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,651
      the sheets of dough       
      exit and accumulate.      

223
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,853
       when several layers      
         have piled up,         

224
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,322
 the dough is on the move again.

225
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,991
  several layers at a time now, 

226
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,260
        it moves between        
      a series of rollers,      

227
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,063
    which compress the dough    
    to its final thickness.     

228
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,531
    a quick dust with flour,    

229
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,535
          and the dough         
 now goes under a rolling cutter

230
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:26,271
         that scores it         
  to cracker-size proportions.  

231
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:30,274
 the cutter is also spiked with 
 pins that puncture the dough.  

232
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,811
   the holes give the crackers  
         a dimpled look,        

233
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,946
          and they have         
      a practical purpose,      

234
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,151
 allowing steam to escape during
  cooking for a crispier snack. 

235
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,686
       a sprinkle of salt,      

236
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,023
      and the cracker dough     
    now heads into the oven.    

237
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,625
            this oven           
   is more than 65 yards long,  

238
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,427
   with several heating zones.  

239
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,432
      the hottest is around     
     700 degrees fahrenheit.    

240
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,569
      a roller breaks them      
 cleanly along the score lines. 

241
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,240
a quick spray with vegetable oil
          adds flavor.          

242
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,712
   the crackers then transfer   
  from one conveyer to another  

243
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,248
    and land in neat stacks.    

244
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,450
         they head into         
     an inspection station,     

245
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,852
     where workers pick out     
      any damaged crackers      

246
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,989
    and adjust the alignment    
      of the shingled rows      

247
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,059
   so it's a smooth transition  
as the crackers move into lanes.

248
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,328
         down the line,         

249
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,064
    workers pull off samples    
         to weigh them.         

250
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,466
         then equipment         
   flips the crackers upright,  

251
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,803
        positioning them        
   to enter the filling line.   

252
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,339
    the peanut-butter filling   
     is ready and kept warm     

253
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,809
so it's smooth and creamy enough
            to pump.            

254
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,344
        the top crackers        

255
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,280
        now head downward       
   in a precise configuration,  

256
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,748
          while below,          

257
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,219
  the bottom crackers whiz by   
  the peanut-butter depositor.  

258
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,955
            it pumps            
    a dollop of peanut butter   

259
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,957
    onto each bottom cracker.   

260
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:59,431
    the peanut-butter-covered   
         bottom crackers        

261
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,300
   now move forward to meet up  
     with the top crackers.     

262
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,837
 and again, with perfect timing,

263
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,641
  the top crackers land on the  
 bottom ones in exact alignment.

264
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,845
    equipment separates them    
       into sets of three       

265
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,513
  as they head into packaging.  

266
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,916
   plastic wrap envelops them,  

267
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,420
        and a heat sealer       
  cuts and closes the packets.  

268
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,523
         suctioning arms        
       collect the packets      

269
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,593
        and transfer them       
       to cardboard boxes.      

270
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:33,064
    from mixing to packaging,   
   it has taken about 24 hours  

271
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,800
       to produce a packet      
      of sandwich crackers.     

272
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,069
         once it reaches        
        a hungry snacker,       

273
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,972
         it will be gone        
       in no time at all.       

274
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,228
narrator: a traditional drinking
vessel typically used for beer, 

275
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,163
a tankard often has a hinged lid

276
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,699
       you raise and lower      
       with a thumb lever.      

277
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,167
           dating back          
    to 15th-century england,    

278
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,771
    they were initially made    
 of wood, then silver or pewter.

279
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:18,843
 the tradition of hand-crafting 
pewter tankards continues today.

280
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,180
     this manufacturer makes    
 pewter tankards in many styles,

281
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,515
          one of which          

282
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,384
      has the legend of the     
 king's shilling engraved on it 

283
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,721
       and a reproduction       
  of a shilling coin from 1816  

284
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,656
  encased in the glass bottom.  

285
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,793
   every step is done by hand,  
beginning with a sheet of pewter

286
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,063
           that's just          
     1/14 of an inch thick.     

287
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,999
      using a punch press,      
   they cut it into the shape   

288
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,603
            required            
   to form the tankard's body.  

289
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:48,072
 next, they place the pewter on 
 a copper plate that has on it, 

290
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,743
 in raised lettering, the story 
     of the king's shilling.    

291
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,346
         they feed this         
     in between two rollers     

292
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,880
           that press           
 the lettering into the pewter. 

293
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,083
      a soft metal, pewter      
   is composed mostly of tin,   

294
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,886
  along with smaller quantities 
     of two other metals --     

295
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,023
      antimony and copper.      

296
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,892
 next, a metalsmith takes over. 

297
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,561
  he manually bends the pewter  

298
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,664
   into the cylindrical shape   
     of the tankard's body.     

299
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,201
       he brushes on flux,      

300
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,505
     a chemical which helps     
 molten metal flow more easily. 

301
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,373
  then, with a soldering tool,  

302
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,643
 he fuses the edges of the body 
      with pure tin solder.     

303
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,914
 traditionally, both the pewter 
   and solder contained lead,   

304
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,916
 but today, both are lead-free. 

305
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:35,920
   next, the metalsmith slides  
 the cylinder onto a steel form 

306
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,390
           and hammers          
      the solder seam flat,     

307
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,926
          rendering it          
      virtually invisible.      

308
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,131
   now a specialized tradesman  
    known as a pewter spinner   

309
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,532
  slips the body onto a lathe.  

310
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,868
      as the lathe rotates,     

311
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,339
    he uses a series of tools   
     to smooth the surface,     

312
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,474
           trim excess          
     off the top and bottom,    

313
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,345
   and turn the top edge over   
         to form a lip.         

314
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:04,282
   next, a buffer uses pumice   
   and a cloth buffing wheel    

315
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:08,553
   to remove imperfections and  
 make the surface silky-smooth. 

316
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,556
           meanwhile,           
   in the casting department,   

317
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,626
     they heat solid pewter     
    to 465 degrees fahrenheit   

318
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,964
   then carefully pour the now  
molten metal into a rubber mold.

319
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:23,367
   inside are several cavities  
 for shillings and large rings. 

320
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,504
     after about 30 seconds,    
     the pewter solidifies,     

321
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,440
   and the parts can come out.  

322
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,642
  to make the tankard's handle, 

323
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:34,179
 the casters pour molten pewter 
       into a steel mold,       

324
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,581
       then tilt the mold       
       in all directions        

325
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,650
            to spread           
    the rapidly setting metal   

326
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,518
            all along           
     the wall of the cavity.    

327
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,055
  this makes the handle hollow  
   and therefore lightweight.   

328
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,591
       they grind the ends      
       on an abrasive belt      

329
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:50,128
  so the handle will fit flush  
    against the tankard body.   

330
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,263
   another worker, meanwhile,   

331
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,133
            assembles           
    the tankard's glass base.   

332
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,069
          a glass disk,         
       a shilling, a ring,      

333
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,738
    then a second glass disk.   

334
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,339
   the ring acts as a spacer,   

335
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,342
    creating enough of a gap    
    between the glass disks     

336
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,411
        to allow the coin       
        to slide around.        

337
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,415
   he applies waterproof glue   
      around the perimeter      

338
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,616
 to adhere everything together. 

339
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,554
  next, he places this shilling 
    sandwich in a pewter base   

340
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:21,059
    and adheres a second ring   
        to hide the glue.       

341
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,563
   back to the metalsmith now.  

342
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:30,568
 he dabs the tankard's body onto
  a pad impregnated with flux.  

343
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,838
    he then solders together    
       the body and base.       

344
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,111
  once the parts are attached,  

345
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,014
         a final buffing        
     with a soft felt wheel.    

346
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,053
      next, the metalsmith      
  dips the handle ends in flux  

347
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,923
  and solders them to the body. 

348
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,991
            to avoid            
scorching the tankard's surface,

349
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,728
        this time he uses       
    a bismuth-and-tin solder,   

350
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,364
         which requires         
  a lower temperature to melt.  

351
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,268
           the tankard          
    is now fully constructed.   

352
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,473
 they clean it in a dishwasher, 
        then shine it up.       

353
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,674
             first,             
  the polisher does the inside, 

354
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,811
       using a rough-grid       
       abrasive compound,       

355
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,146
    producing a matte finish.   

356
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:19,150
  then he polishes the outside, 
  using a finer-grid compound.  

357
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:22,286
          this produces         
  a contrasting mirror finish.  

358
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,222
    in 18th- and 19th-century   
            england,            

359
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,293
           a volunteer          
    for army or naval service   

360
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,962
 accepted a shilling as a bonus 
        upon signing up.        

361
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,698
            however,            
volunteers were in short supply,

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,501
     so recruiters are said     
      to have visited pubs      

363
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,869
      and slipped shillings     

364
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,638
    into the pewter tankards    
       of inebriated men,       

365
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,373
    who, upon their last sip,   

366
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,043
     discovered they'd been     
       duped into serving.      

367
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,578
     it may well be a myth,     

368
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,615
 but it still makes a darn good 
   story to share over a pint.  

369
