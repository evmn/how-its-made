00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,290
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,059
        racing shells...        

5
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,533
   ...stainless-steel sinks...  

6
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,872
          ...leather...         

7
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,745
   ...and pedal steel guitars.  

8
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:57,456
 the racing shell is a high-tech
 rowboat that's built for speed.

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,194
 long and exceptionally narrow, 

10
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,729
          it's designed         
    to cut through wave drag    

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,266
    and leave the competition   
          in its wake.          

12
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,146
   racing shells are made for   
 single rowers, called scullers,

13
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,482
   for pairs, or entire crews.  

14
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:32,758
       they're custom-made      
   to precise specifications.   

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,761
   racers need to travel light  
       to maintain speed,       

16
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,964
     so these boats are made    
  from reinforced carbon fiber, 

17
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,099
     which weighs a lot less    
           than wood.           

18
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,836
     first, several of these    
       carbon-fiber sheets      

19
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,973
      are layered in a mold     
   and trimmed along the edge.  

20
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,383
 textured thermoplastic called  
 honeycomb gets a spray of glue 

21
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,753
    and is then pressed onto    
    the carbon-fiber plies.     

22
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,725
    sandwiched between layers   
        of carbon fiber,        

23
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,195
    the honeycomb will serve    
      as the shell's core,      

24
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,464
    lending some lightweight    
          reinforcement         

25
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,966
      to the delicate hull.     

26
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,546
      next, the entire boat     
  is wrapped in breather cloth  

27
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,880
        and a plastic bag       

28
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,417
 so that the air can be vacuumed
    from between the layers.    

29
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,620
       the breather cloth       
      is a permeable layer      

30
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,089
    that prevents the plastic   
    from sticking to the mold   

31
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,258
    and creating air pockets.   

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,628
      next, the shell goes      
        into a long oven,       

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,896
      which melts the glue      

34
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,832
     that's been impregnated    
     in the carbon material,    

35
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,668
   fusing the layers together.  

36
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,344
 the shell bakes at 210 degrees 
          for 8 hours.          

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,185
      then the plastic and      
 breather cloth are pulled away.

38
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:14,159
  and the boat is pried out of  
 the mold using plastic wedges. 

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,134
       the hull comes out       
       in one solid piece,      

40
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,270
   and a primer paint sprayed   
      into the mold earlier     

41
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,673
           has adhered          
     to the shell's surface.    

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,076
    workers check the weight,   

43
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,146
     which has to be exactly    
   what the customer ordered.   

44
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,349
      next, they reinforce      
       the boat's cockpit       

45
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,154
          with several          
     carbon-fiber bulkheads.    

46
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,699
 foam is glued on the inside rim
      of the racing shell,      

47
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,969
      using a piece of wood     
           as a guide.          

48
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,313
         glue is applied        
      around the bulkheads.     

49
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,649
     then the cockpit panel     
           is lowered           

50
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,385
       so that it adheres       
       to the glued areas       

51
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,120
  and rests on top of the foam  

52
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,656
      that's been installed     
        along the edges.        

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,197
    next, a computerized tool   
          drills holes          

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,333
  for the hardware and riggers  

55
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,738
    and workers trim the rim    
       from stern to bow.       

56
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,807
  they smooth the holes' finish 
      with a grinding tool.     

57
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,613
        and now it's over       
      to the paint station      

58
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,749
  for some sanding and priming. 

59
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,950
 any flaws are marked for repair

60
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,553
      because the slightest     
          imperfection          

61
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,824
 could affect the boat's ability
   to speed through the water.  

62
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,026
          once the boat         
      is perfectly smooth,      

63
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,429
      it gets a high-gloss      
        urethane coating.       

64
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,170
    next, a fin is installed    
    for a little stability.     

65
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:09,508
  a laser guide helps align it  
     into perfect position.     

66
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,581
  a rudder goes into the bottom 
          of the boat.          

67
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,117
      the system of ropes       
      that's attached next      

68
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,586
 will allow the rowers to steer.

69
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,996
  this boat comes with special  
     shoes and sliding seats    

70
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,533
that allow rowers to put a lot  
of leg power into their strokes.

71
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,305
 finally, the rigging equipment 
      for the oars goes in.     

72
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,777
   now this sleek racing shell  
   is ready to hit the water.   

73
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,952
         when we return,        

74
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,089
     turning stainless steel    
   into a sparkling new sink.   

75
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,098
            narrator:           
    the stainless-steel sink    

76
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,698
      is an invention born      
         of patriotism.         

77
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,236
 it evolved during world war ii 
   when sinks were often made   

78
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,839
   from copper-nickel material  
          called monel.         

79
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,708
  when that material was needed 
       for the war effort,      

80
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,778
   stainless steel was drafted  
   for use on the home front,   

81
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,347
 and it's still on kitchen duty 
          to this day.          

82
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,256
 stainless steel is lightweight 
         and heavy-duty,        

83
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,525
 which makes it great for sinks.

84
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,395
 the process begins with a large
    sheet of stainless steel,   

85
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,899
 uncoiled and sliced into pieces
         called blanks.         

86
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,442
      each blank goes under     
       a 1,000-ton press.       

87
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,348
     as the press descends,     
    a punch rises from below,   

88
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,717
      stretching the steel      
    into a rough sink shape.    

89
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,764
  this process also transforms  
 the steel on a molecular level,

90
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,434
          hardening it.         

91
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,113
   workers brush lubricant in   
    and around the sink bowl    

92
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,583
        to make it easier       
      to stretch it again.      

93
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,725
  the bowl goes under the same  
    punch press a second time   

94
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,461
    for more precise shaping.   

95
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,531
this second working of the steel
      hardens it even more.     

96
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,075
    now the sink goes under     
    a different punch device    

97
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,046
   that cuts out a drain hole   
   and forms a lip around it.   

98
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,350
  as coolant flushes the sink,  

99
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,820
        an abrasive belt        
       grinds the surface       

100
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,589
   to give it a brushed look.   

101
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:26,037
    next, a sink bowl slides    
    into a welding machine.     

102
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,974
 a second sink bowl is lined up 
     against the first one.     

103
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,747
   inside, an electrode welds   
     the two sinks together.    

104
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,991
      using enormous force,     

105
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,994
 a roller moves across the seam 
         to flatten it.         

106
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,398
     a grinding belt behind     
    the roller sands it down.   

107
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:03,542
  now that the seam joining the 
two sinks is level and smooth...

108
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,282
      ...it's time to give      
   the sink's rim some shape.   

109
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,358
     this die forms recesses    
   along the sink's perimeter.  

110
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,294
  these recesses give the sink  
          a sleek look          

111
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,663
    and collect water runoff.   

112
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,506
  another press trims the rim   
  and gives it a bevel finish,  

113
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,175
which softens those rough edges.

114
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,717
   now, using a punch cutter,   

115
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,320
   workers pierce the back rim  
           of the sink          

116
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,424
    to make holes for faucets   
      and a soap dispenser.     

117
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,436
    then they grind and buff    
   the sink to a fine finish.   

118
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,610
  it's a very intensive process 
  that takes about 25 minutes.  

119
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,690
    the company's trademark     
    is embossed on the sink.    

120
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,834
     then the sink's drains     
           are plugged          

121
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,304
         and a substance        
     similar to latex paint     

122
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,107
  is sprayed onto the outside.  

123
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,777
the finish will muffle the sound
      of clattering dishes      

124
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,481
     and protect the outside    
 of the sink from condensation. 

125
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,122
 it takes about 2 1/2 hours to  
 make a stainless-steel sink -- 

126
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,492
    a functional and stylish    
    addition to any kitchen.    

127
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,596
           coming up,           
     turning hairy cowhides     

128
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,265
  into buttery-smooth leather.  

129
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,076
  narrator: leather production  
  dates back to primitive times 

130
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,213
  when humans rubbed fats into  
 animal skins to preserve them. 

131
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,283
      times have changed,       
      but leather endures.      

132
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,218
   from footwear to furniture,  

133
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,289
   this tough material remains  
 an integral part of our lives. 

134
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,566
   this leather comes from the  
 hides of cows killed for meat. 

135
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,037
 without tanning, these cowhides
       would go to waste.       

136
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,140
   converting them to leather   
     is a kind of recycling.    

137
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,912
         the first step         
  is to cut each hide in half.  

138
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,917
      the hides are draped      
        over a sawhorse,        

139
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,388
          stamped with          
    an identification code...   

140
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,723
   and sliced down the center.  

141
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,594
   two smaller pieces will be   
  easier to handle and process  

142
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,196
      than one large hide.      

143
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,871
  hundreds of these hide halves 

144
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,540
           are loaded           
  into a modified cement mixer  

145
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,375
 for some serious hair removal. 

146
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,619
 as the mixer fills with water, 

147
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:38,756
 a worker dumps in a combination
 of sodium sulfydrate and lime. 

148
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,193
       a chemical reaction      
 strips the hair from the hides.

149
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,701
       the hairless hides       
      now get an acid bath      

150
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,337
         to prepare them        
    for the tanning process.    

151
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,980
   the tanning itself happens   
     inside big wooden drums    

152
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,651
  with prongs to keep the skins 
      from getting tangled.     

153
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,921
   chrome salts turn the hides  
       a robin's-egg blue       

154
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,258
       as they bind to the      
  collagen fibers of the skins. 

155
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,227
     the hides have now been    
     preserved into leather.    

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,935
        next, the pieces        
      are fed grain-side up     

157
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:28,206
 into a machine that slices the 
 leather to an even thickness.  

158
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,284
  the cutoffs won't be wasted.  

159
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,287
 they'll be recycled into suede.

160
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,491
    workers check each piece    
    of leather with a gauge     

161
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,961
  to confirm that the thickness 
           is uniform.          

162
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,102
  now it's back into the wooden 
   drums for a second tanning,  

163
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,038
   this time using a solution   
      of vegetable extract,     

164
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,641
      tree bark, and water.     

165
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,776
          dye is added          
      along with a chemical     

166
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,312
   that will make the leather   
        water-resistant.        

167
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,581
          the solution          
      binds to the leather,     

168
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,250
   giving it a brownish tone.   

169
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,186
     it's a gentler process     
     than the first tanning,    

170
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,289
   and it softens the leather.  

171
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,995
          now a mixture         
       of starch and water      

172
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,464
           is brushed           
     onto the tanned hides.     

173
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,467
    this paste-like solution    
        allows the hides        

174
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,202
          to be pressed         
     onto big glass frames,     

175
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,641
 which also have been moistened 
 with the same starchy mixture. 

176
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,352
 this process allows the leather
         to dry flat...         

177
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,060
...prevents it from shrinking...

178
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,865
     ...and stops the edges     
        from curling up.        

179
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:16,981
  after four hours in a dryer,  
it's time to remove the leather.

180
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,984
      it easily peels away      
         from the glass.        

181
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,892
  a revolving paint-gun system  
        dyes the leather.       

182
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,402
        and now it's time       
   for the finishing touches.   

183
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:41,672
  a glazing jack pulls a glass  
   cylinder over the leather,   

184
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,475
     and the abrasive action    
          polishes it.          

185
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,410
   this glass is very strong,   

186
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:51,349
 so it can do this vigorous work
       without shattering.      

187
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,287
  finally, huge heated rollers  
    smooth out any wrinkles.    

188
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,556
          it's the end          
     of the production line     

189
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,358
  for this big pile of leather  

190
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
     but just the beginning     
   for so many other products.  

191
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,898
   fashionable and tough, it's  
 no wonder this ancient material

192
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,969
       continues to be one      
 of our favorite products today.

193
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,038
     up next, an instrument     

194
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,041
that's almost as tricky to build
        as it is to play.       

195
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,918
            narrator:           
 playing the pedal steel guitar 
   takes quite a lot of skill.  

196
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,854
      you slide a steel bar     
     up and down the strings    

197
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,322
       as you pluck them,       

198
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,992
all the while operating a system
of pedals and knee levers below.

199
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,529
  this means using both hands,  
   both feet, and both knees.   

200
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,065
   but a pedal steel guitar's   
          unique sound          

201
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,135
      and impressive range      
    are worth all the effort.   

202
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,070
  [ pedal steel guitar plays ]  

203
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,888
   to make one, a guitar maker  

204
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,358
      first carves the neck     
of the instrument from hardwood.

205
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,898
          he beads glue         
  around the edges of the neck  

206
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,901
       and applies strips       
   of intricate wooden inlay.   

207
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,176
    once the fretboard design   
 is silk-screened onto the top, 

208
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,778
  the guitar neck is complete.  

209
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,448
        the guitar maker        
     then outlines a design     

210
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,317
  onto aircraft-grade aluminum  
         and cuts it out        

211
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,720
      to make an end plate      
      for the guitar frame.     

212
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,522
      he pops the end plate     
   out of the holding device.   

213
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,059
        then he welds it        
  to the rest of the framework  

214
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,661
     and polishes everything    
       to a mirror finish.      

215
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,872
  next, the part of the guitar  
  called the steps is machined. 

216
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,616
   the holes in the steps will  
 be used to attach tuning pegs. 

217
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,685
  there's one for every string. 

218
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:12,957
 the steps are attached to the  
 neck just above the fretboard. 

219
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,625
    this is the pickup plate.   

220
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:18,162
  it will hold the device that  
transfers sound to the amplifier

221
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,598
       as well as a series      
        of metal fingers.       

222
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:28,172
      the fingers are made      
  from several aluminum pieces  

223
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:32,176
        that are machined       
     and assembled together.    

224
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,813
 the fingers pivot to raise and 
 lower the pitch of the strings.

225
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,651
  all of the fingers are fitted 
      into the pickup plate     

226
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,454
    and secured with screws.    

227
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,591
 the guitar maker double-checks 
     the fingers' movement,     

228
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,393
     then he hooks springs      
     to the end of each one     

229
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,195
 to maintain the proper tension.

230
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,271
  a little grease ensures that  
 this next step goes smoothly --

231
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,008
         the production         
  of the guitar's cross-shafts. 

232
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,946
          then it's on          
  to the guitar's undercarriage 

233
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,815
  and the system of foot pedals 
         and knee levers        

234
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,219
   that will move the fingers.  

235
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,022
        the guitar maker        
  screws several cross-shafts,  

236
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,725
       one for each pedal,      
     into the undercarriage.    

237
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,864
     he attaches bell cranks    
     to the cross-shafts...     

238
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,101
...then connects thin steel rods

239
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,971
        from the fingers        
       to the bell cranks.      

240
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,578
           this system          
    will allow the performer    

241
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,181
   to tighten or relax strings  
         while playing,         

242
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,417
   which gives the instrument   
   its characteristic sound.    

243
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,069
        the guitar maker        
      tests the knee lever.     

244
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,345
       here he's winding        
       copper-coated wire       

245
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,014
       around a cartridge       
       thousands of times       

246
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,749
  to make the guitar's pickup,  

247
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,953
   which transfers sound from   
  the guitar to the amplifier.  

248
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,762
          he takes two          
  of the wire-bound cartridges  

249
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,099
and places a magnet between them
     to complete the pickup.    

250
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,502
 then he fits it into the other 
    slot in the pickup plate    

251
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,705
     just above the fingers.    

252
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:44,775
 now, using a gauge and a level,
     he adjusts the pickup.     

253
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,645
    it has to sit low enough    
           in the slot          

254
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,447
     that it won't interfere    
        with the strings.       

255
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,516
 there's no room for error here.

256
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:56,520
  the positioning must be exact 
or the guitar won't sound right.

257
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,461
  10 to 12 strings are attached 
       to the guitar neck.      

258
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,463
 some instruments have two necks

259
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,166
   to add even more dimension   
          to the sound.         

260
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,947
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,        

261
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,617
   or if you'd like to suggest  
    topics for future shows,
