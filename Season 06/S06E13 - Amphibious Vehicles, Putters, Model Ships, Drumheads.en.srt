00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,492
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,227
amphibious vehicles...     

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,899
...putters...         

4
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,838
...model ships...       

5
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,511
...and drumheads.       

6
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,920
a vehicle is amphibious    

7
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,855
when it travels on land and water.           

8
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,391
this one's used mainly by hunters and fishermen,   

9
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,861
but also by utility companies and the military.       

10
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,465
wide, rugged tires easily trek through mud, snow, and bushes. 

11
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,534
when the vehicle's in the water,

12
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:11,503
the tires' deep treads also function as paddles.   

13
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,408
this eight-wheel model     

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,812
can carry six people on land and four in the water.     

15
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:23,014
buoyancy requires a lighter load.        

16
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,618
they begin production by welding
8 steel sections together   

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,420
to make the driver's seat,   

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,756
then 12 other parts for the vehicle's main frame. 

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,227
this frame will later house the seat, a gas tank,     

20
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,363
the battery, and a storage box.

21
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,900
next, a worker assembles what's called the axle hub.  

22
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,769
a robotic press punches five bolts       

23
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,305
through the components to fuse them.         

24
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,908
this design keeps the hub lightweight   

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,678
and strengthens the axle for driving on rough terrain. 

26
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,249
next, a worker inserts what's called the axle shaft  

27
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,451
through the hub.        

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,785
a robotic welding machine   

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,223
then fuses the shaft to one side of the hub.    

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,929
after he flips it,       

31
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,332
the machine welds the shaft to the hub's other side.    

32
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,135
this company uses a robot for this important step    

33
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,406
because it's faster and more precise.       

34
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,476
here, a worker reveals some of the vehicle's secrets 

35
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,344
to functioning in water.    

36
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,014
each axle's bearing has rubber and steel collars    

37
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,149
called flanges.        

38
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,218
they form a waterproof seal over the axle.         

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,355
the worker greases these flanges
to lubricate them       

40
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,625
and to keep dust and water from infiltrating.       

41
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:43,695
he inserts one of 16 gaskets between the flanges.      

42
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,896
they're made of cork      

43
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,233
to keep moisture out and grease from escaping.   

44
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,636
after adding another flange and a gasket,         

45
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:55,106
he applies a liquid compound to rustproof the steel shaft. 

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,642
here, a computer-guided cutting tool          

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,444
carves teeth on a steel ring  

48
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,648
to create one of the vehicle's 17 gears.           

49
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,250
lubricant cools the heat this generates         

50
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,986
so that the machine doesn't overheat and break down.    

51
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,456
when the cutting's complete, robotic arms remove the gear  

52
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,458
and replace it with a new, unshaped ring.   

53
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,195
the gears range from about the size of a coin    

54
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,063
to the size of a dinner plate. 

55
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,069
here's how the shift lever changes the gears       

56
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,138
from neutral to low to high and into reverse.       

57
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,540
and here's how the clutch will transfer power,      

58
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,543
via a component called the input shaft,        

59
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,213
into the transmission.     

60
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,283
a worker hooks up the transmission to the engine,

61
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,219
then he slides two clutches onto the input shaft.     

62
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,022
he attaches each one with a bolt and two washers,  

63
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,491
then connects the engine to the transmission      

64
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,227
with a rubber drive belt, encircling the clutches.    

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,696
two brake calipers connect the brake system        

66
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,164
to the transmission.      

67
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,101
now he tests the drive belt, clutch system,         

68
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,570
engine rotations, brakes, and steering.         

69
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,839
the wheels don't turn.     

70
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,375
the driver steers the vehicle 

71
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,576
by slowing or braking either set of wheels      

72
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,246
and skidding to one side.   

73
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,048
to make the vehicle's lower body,          

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,184
they take a sheet of polyethylene,        

75
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,453
a heavy-duty plastic, and heat it in an oven.    

76
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,857
after 4 1/2 minutes at 450 degrees fahrenheit,   

77
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,460
the sheet emerges, softened by the heat.     

78
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,328
an aluminum mold drops down,  

79
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,132
and a vacuum-forming machine  
stretches the plastic around it,

80
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,668
sucking out the air from between the two.     

81
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,472
after the plastic cools for 4 1/2 minutes,       

82
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,273
the machine lifts the mold,  

83
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,443
leaving a cavity about the size
of a large bathtub.      

84
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:47,819
two workers then move the lower
body to an assembly line.   

85
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:52,557
they insert the vehicle's main frame, now painted black. 

86
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,094
then, on the outside, they mount four extensions   

87
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,897
that will carry the vehicle's two front and two rear axles. 

88
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,568
these will enable the axles  
to withstand greater punishment.

89
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,704
they install eight drive chains

90
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,973
onto sprockets on the axle shafts,      

91
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,375
then two more linking the transmission    

92
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,977
to the components that propel the vehicle --   

93
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,713
what's called the drive system.

94
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,583
a worker then attached an end plate to complete the link.  

95
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,387
workers lower the 26-horsepower
engine into the carriage    

96
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,455
and attach it with three bolts.

97
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,126
next, the polyethylene upper body, and then the wheels.   

98
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,328
they test the drive chains for tension          

99
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,597
and sprockets for vibrations. 

100
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,066
the wheels are twice as wide as most car wheels       

101
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,736
but 10 times softer, to cushion the ride.      

102
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,738
on land, this $16,000 vehicle 

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,208
travels up to 21 miles per hour.

104
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,811
top speed in the water is only 3 miles an hour.    

105
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,847
but, hey, it's easier than swimming.   

106
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,825
narrator: golf players in 17th-century scotland    

107
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,761
were the first to hone their game       

108
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,630
by using differently shaped clubs for specific tasks.   

109
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,766
today, you use what's called a putter     

110
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,834
to gently roll the ball into the hole         

111
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,303
using the fewest number of strokes.          

112
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,238
the club's high-tech, streamlined design       

113
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,743
is crucial to any golfer's putting strategy.       

114
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,981
this company uses a robotic tester        

115
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,650
to spot-check its putters for quality.          

116
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,985
the club passes if the balls roll along a straight line   

117
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,788
into the hole.         

118
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,924
that means the putter's striking
with just the right impact.  

119
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,193
production begins with bars of aluminum,     

120
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,929
a metal that's lightweight and easy to sculpt.      

121
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,799
a band saw slices them into 4 1/2-inch-long pieces.  

122
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,134
each piece will become a putter head,         

123
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,604
the part of the club that hits the ball.       

124
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,409
a computer-guided cutting tool sculpts the heads       

125
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,278
by shaving away up to a third of the aluminum. 

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,881
the machine first mills one side
of the head into tiny steps.  

127
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,549
another cutting tool      

128
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,887
then shapes this area into a smooth curve.      

129
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,122
the process takes 10 minutes. 

130
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,160
then the four-sided platform revolves,       

131
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,464
and the cutter begins working on the next putter head.    

132
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,703
another milling machine carves blocks of copper-nickel alloy  

133
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,571
into what's called the insert. 

134
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,508
this part will fit into a cavity
in the putter head,      

135
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,644
making the area that strikes the ball firm yet resonant.   

136
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,846
it's why the golfer feels the impact           

137
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,916
reverberate through the putter --         

138
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,284
what's known as feedback.   

139
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,590
this device performs random quality checks     

140
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,326
of the insert cavities in the putter heads.      

141
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,727
a vise holds the head     

142
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,430
as the probe gauges the cavity's
width and depth.        

143
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,268
next, these chunks of copper go into a chemical bath    

144
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,870
with putter-head models made of different metals.   

145
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,206
the material from which a putter head's made      

146
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,276
determines the weight and feel of the club.     

147
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,879
this 10-minute bath removes any contaminants        

148
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,681
from the surface of the metals 

149
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,616
and coats the heads in copper. 

150
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,886
this ensures that the plating 
they're going to get will stick.

151
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,223
after that, the heads are plated
in a different metal.     

152
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,559
this determines how the club looks.      

153
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,161
for this, chunks of mat-finished nickel 

154
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,030
go into a second chemical bath.

155
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,167
they'll provide one of this company's four finishes,    

156
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,902
ranging from mat to shiny.   

157
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,639
during this 15-minute step,  

158
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,242
a mechanical arm occasionally shifts the rack  

159
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,412
to disperse the chemicals and thoroughly plate the heads.

160
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,323
to fit the insert,       

161
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,060
a worker first positions the head in a vise.      

162
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,463
he applies four drops of epoxy glue         

163
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,865
inside the rim of the insert cavity.     

164
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,934
this provides additional bonding       

165
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,403
once they force the inset all the way in.        

166
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,679
after placing the insert in the cavity by hand,     

167
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,149
a worker uses a press to force it inside.      

168
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,353
they cover the press with paper
so it won't scratch the insert,

169
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,390
which must be flush with the surface of the head. 

170
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,699
any air under the insert escapes
through a hole underneath,   

171
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,668
where they'll insert the club shaft.        

172
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,105
a worker first applies glue inside the hole,        

173
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,573
then he inserts the shaft   

174
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,175
and secures it to a template with rubber bands.       

175
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,378
the shaft is made of stainless steel.      

176
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,381
they usually come in standard lengths      

177
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,384
of 33, 34, and 35 inches.   

178
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,988
they're set at the angle most players prefer -- 18 degrees. 

179
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,323
the next step is to mount a handgrip      

180
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,791
at the top of the shaft.    

181
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,728
first, a worker wraps the top in double-sided tape.     

182
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,896
then he pours water over the tape         

183
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,066
to dilute the glue on its surface.        

184
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,002
this will enable the grip to slide on more easily.    

185
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,538
he pours water inside the grip, as well.   

186
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,073
the grip is a rubber sleeve  

187
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,542
that's just under 10 inches long.        

188
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,478
once lubricated, it shimmies over the shaft   

189
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,147
for a snug fit that lasts up to three years.       

190
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,551
he lines up the flat part   
of the grip at a 90-degree angle

191
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,953
with the flat part of the putter head.      

192
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,689
this helps the player strike the ball properly.   

193
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,761
next, a worker colors the club's engraved logo.   

194
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,965
using a tiny nozzle, she applies
minute amounts of epoxy paint 

195
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,233
inside the groves of the design.

196
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,770
she controls the amount of paint
with a foot pedal       

197
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,239
that released pressurized air into the nozzle.        

198
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,241
this company makes putter heads

199
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,645
in some fairly luxurious materials,           

200
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,446
including beryllium copper.  

201
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,849
that's one for players wanting a club with a softer feel   

202
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,754
and who don't mind paying up to $500 to get it.     

203
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,464
narrator: model ships are made for naval gazing.       

204
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,265
they're representations of real ships.         

205
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,868
some are built meticulously to scale     

206
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,670
with extreme attention to detail           

207
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,539
and are truly museum pieces.  

208
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,942
you can buy model ships preassembled or in kits.    

209
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,144
but be careful.        

210
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,946
these are truly delicate works of art.         

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,955
the<i> portland</i> steamer sank in the atlantic in 1898, 

212
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,624
all lives lost.        

213
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,960
but its image survives in models.           

214
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,029
to make a model like the<i> portland,</i>       

215
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,232
the worker selects some wooden pieces from a stock room.   

216
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,035
model ships are actually made of thousands of parts,     

217
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,503
big and small.         

218
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:50,108
these are just a few, and some are to be cut down.  

219
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,942
a computer guides a laser beam 

220
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,580
as it carves the larger, flat pieces of wood into many parts.

221
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,516
they'll be components for the ship's deckhouse.   

222
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,389
next, a worker shapes a hull, or main body,         

223
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,326
using a machine called a duplicating carver.      

224
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,462
holding the machine's stylus on the left,          

225
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,132
he traces around a master shape.

226
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,867
this motion guides two routers on the right          

227
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,936
as they chisel into basswood, 

228
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,439
making exact copies of the master hull.      

229
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,546
to make resin parts,      

230
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,349
they mix polyurethane with some plasticizer     

231
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,351
and pour it into a mold.    

232
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,887
a chemical reaction causes it to harden.      

233
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,555
this take up to a half-hour,  

234
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:41,126
and then they pull a newly   
shaped lifeboat out of the mold.

235
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,499
next, a worker cleans up another mold.         

236
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,836
it's to be used to shape cast-metal anchors.      

237
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,507
he places the mold in a centrifuge        

238
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,578
and pours a melted mix of tin, antimony, and copper into it.  

239
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,781
the centrifuge spins, and this causes the metal   

240
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,851
to fill the cavities in the mold
and solidify.         

241
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,854
he opens the mold and finds the anchors     

242
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,890
formed like spokes around the hub.        

243
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,630
it's anchors away as he snips them free.     

244
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,434
now a worker sands smooth the bottom of the hull.    

245
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,807
then he positions the first of the ship's five decks.   

246
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,877
he glues wooden spacers between the decks.       

247
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,084
a special glue that dries in about 10 seconds      

248
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,121
allows him to work quickly as he builds the tiers.    

249
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,694
next, he submerges a deckhouse sidepiece in water       

250
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,362
to soften the wood.      

251
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,564
he cuts the little tabs    

252
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,368
to free other deckhouse parts from a matrix.         

253
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,639
after that, he carves out   
the center of two of the pieces.

254
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,775
then he glues a block between them          

255
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,044
and applies more glue to the edges.         

256
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,779
he bends the deckhouse side,  

257
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,981
which is now wet and supple, around the structure.     

258
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,118
the moisture causes a chemical reaction in the glue

259
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
which strengthens it.     

260
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:20,258
after he positions the deckhouse starboard side, 

261
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,326
he sticks a strip of clear acetate        

262
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,528
to the back of a band of windows.     

263
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,998
the acetate simulates glass.  

264
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,137
he paints the front of the windowed wall white   

265
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,806
and then turns it around    

266
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:38,409
to paint red curtains on the acetate.        

267
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:42,680
other detailing has been laser-etched into the wood.  

268
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,150
he glues the wall of windows between deck tiers,      

269
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:50,220
and the look is authentic.   

270
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,757
he positions paddle wheels on each side.         

271
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,026
these have 57 wood paddles   

272
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,228
held in place by brass radials.

273
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,701
remember the anchors cast in the centrifuge mold earlier?

274
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,038
he now positions some on the ship deck.       

275
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,307
then he prepares the lifeboats.

276
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,110
the larger plastic one goes on the upper deck.    

277
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,148
this golden eagle is the finishing touch.    

278
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:24,388
here, another worker rigs up a four-masted schooner.    

279
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,324
using surgical clamps,     

280
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,594
he pins the ropes down so they don't get in the way. 

281
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,996
then he measures a piece of decking       

282
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,332
to make the top of the deckhouse.       

283
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,468
he glues it to a base...    

284
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,138
and then positions it on the ship.          

285
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,077
next, a jeweler's lathe spins a piece of brass     

286
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,080
as a worker manipulates a cutter,     

287
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,215
milling parts for the ship's bell.      

288
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,818
once it's mounted,       

289
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,156
this ship model is ready for everyone to admire.     

290
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,336
narrator: a drum's playing surface is called the drumhead.

291
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,373
it's the part of the instrument
that vibrates, creating sound. 

292
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,841
some drumheads are still made 

293
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,976
the traditional way, from animal skin.       

294
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,045
but a natural skin is very susceptible        

295
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,980
to temperature and humidity changes,     

296
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,783
so most drummers today prefer heads          

297
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,152
made of modern, synthetic materials.      

298
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,796
the drumhead surface is often called the skin     

299
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,465
because, traditionally, it was made of calfskin.    

300
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,802
this synthetic skin is a flexible plastic film    

301
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,005
called polyethylene terephthalate,         

302
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,006
the same polyester-based plastic

303
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,342
they use to make soft-drink bottles.      

304
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,479
workers load several sheets of it into a press       

305
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:58,483
that applies 75 tons of force onto sharp, circle-shaped dies,

306
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,619
pushing them upward through the film sheets.    

307
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,455
the die-cut film circles become the skins.       

308
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,695
a skin could be made up of just one film circle    

309
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,630
or several taped together.   

310
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,166
workers assemble the layers using a vacuum turntable.   

311
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,068
the suction keeps the bottom film steady     

312
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,705
while they apply tape to its outside edge      

313
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,107
and then adhere another film on top.      

314
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,643
each layer is called a ply.  

315
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,178
the more plies a skin has,   

316
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,780
the more bass frequencies it'll produce.         

317
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,584
now the skins go onto a computer-guided drill press. 

318
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,854
the machine drills tiny holes all along their perimeter,   

319
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,656
about 1/8 of an inch in.    

320
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,804
the holes are roughly the size of a nailhead.    

321
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,607
they're spaced about 1/4 inch apart.     

322
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,079
the next machine heats the edge
of each film to soften it,   

323
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,549
then applies pressure to mold it to shape.      

324
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,151
the skin comes out with a fluted edge,      

325
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,153
like what you see on a paper cup.        

326
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,956
this shape keeps the tension even        

327
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,725
when the musician tightens the skin to tune the drum.   

328
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,696
meanwhile, this roll-forming machine   

329
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,631
uses a series of pressure rollers      

330
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,368
to gradually shape an aluminum strip into a hoop. 

331
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,304
the hoop will hold the skin tightly over the drum's body, 

332
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,106
called the drum shell,     

333
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,042
creating the tension you need to produce sound.       

334
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,046
this machine also imprints tiny dimples   

335
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,914
onto one side of the strip.  

336
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,317
when the factory later glues together the skin and hoop,   

337
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,587
this rough texture will improve the bond.     

338
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,591
now the machine folds the edges
of the strip inward      

339
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,060
to create a channel on the inside of the hoop.   

340
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,062
that's where the glue will go. 

341
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,401
once the machine finishes forming the hoop,       

342
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,538
a small, built-in circular saw cuts the end.         

343
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:07,678
a worker then loads each hoop onto a rotation soldering jig, 

344
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,014
positioning the ends together. 

345
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,217
the rest is all automated.   

346
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:17,755
a glob of silver solder on the joint...        

347
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,893
then natural-gas torches fuse the hoop closed.     

348
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,507
after water cools off the hot metal...        

349
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,744
the jig ejects the finished hoop.       

350
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,650
drumhead hoops can be as small as 6 inches      

351
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,520
or as large as 40 inches in diameter.          

352
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,523
finally, it's time to fit the skin into the hoop.    

353
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,458
this is the tricky part,    

354
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,195
because the film must be perfectly level and centered. 

355
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,731
otherwise, when you tighten the skin to tune the drum,   

356
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,933
the short side would tighten before the rest,        

357
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,537
and that uneven tension would throw the tuning off.  

358
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,540
so they do this critical assembly step     

359
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,074
on a specially designed table, 

360
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,210
placing the skins on circular vacuum fixtures  

361
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,347
that are perfectly level.   

362
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,282
as suction holds each one steady,        

363
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,885
a robotic arm runs glue in the hoop's channel     

364
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,153
all the way around.      

365
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,622
the glue drains downward    

366
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,424
through the tiny holes along the skin's perimeter,  

367
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,628
then dries, anchoring the skin securely in the hoop.     

368
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,565
some drumheads go on to get a textured coating.   

369
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,966
by adding weight,       

370
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,769
the coating muffles the higher sound frequencies, 

371
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,570
enhancing the lower ones.   

372
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,307
this produces a warmer, deeper tone.     

373
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,176
it also produces that swooshing sound      

374
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,247
when jazz drummers play softly with brushes.   

375
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,715
once the coating dries,    

376
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,852
a pad-printing machine stamps on the company name.  

377
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:58,455
only about 30% of drumheads on the market are coated.   

378
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,192
the rest are what's known as clear heads.        

379
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,061
and that's how drumheads are made.
