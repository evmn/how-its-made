00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,224
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,160
motorcycles...         

3
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,033
...clay pipes...        

4
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,538
...drumsticks...        

5
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,244
...and whistles.        

6
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,588
the invention of the motorcycle
late in the 19th century    

7
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,922
was speed driven.       

8
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,991
people wanted to go places faster      

9
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,860
than they could on a bicycle. 

10
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,130
so they strapped an engine on a bike -- a simple concept. 

11
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,666
today's motorbike is much more complex,     

12
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,803
and it leaves the earlier versions in the dust.     

13
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,477
these motorbikes are an engineering feat.    

14
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:24,349
they start by welding the frame
out of lightweight aluminum,  

15
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,186
an advantage for speed and fuel efficiency.      

16
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,892
the frames are cleaned, powder-painted,        

17
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,495
then baked to cure the paint. 

18
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,538
they fit a crankshaft and pistons          

19
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,474
into the engine's left block. 

20
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,779
they tighten the bearings and caps,           

21
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,915
then slide in a u-shaped tool called a fork         

22
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,751
that orients the pistons in an upright position.     

23
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,724
next, they compress the piston rings with another tool 

24
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,460
so that the pistons easily slide into place    

25
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,430
as they install the other half of the engine block.      

26
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,673
they place a gasket on the top of the block...   

27
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,809
and then install the cylinder head.       

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,280
using torque-controlled electric
tools, they tighten the bolts 

29
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,283
to attach the cylinder head to the block assembly.     

30
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,486
they install the camshaft in the cylinder head unit.   

31
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,488
the camshaft will drive the valves     

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,158
that bring in air and fuel and let out the exhaust.    

33
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,535
they rotate the crankshaft to fine-tune its action.    

34
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,441
now it's time to give this engine a little test run. 

35
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,844
they fill the engine with coolant and fuel,     

36
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,912
then run through the gears.  

37
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,048
they check for leaks and overall function.     

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,518
when it passes inspection,   

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,887
they purge the coolant from the engine.        

40
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,593
a motorbike engine isn't only about function.   

41
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,194
it also has to look good,   

42
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,064
because it won't be totally hidden under a hood.  

43
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,072
now they lower the 225-pound engine onto a cradle 

44
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,675
that sits on a conveyor.    

45
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,078
they mount the frame onto it. 

46
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,623
they attach the rear wheel assembly...   

47
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,825
and then the front wheel.   

48
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:58,837
they attach the handlebar using torque-controlled tools. 

49
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,577
and they tighten the brake assemblies.     

50
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,481
next, they fill the radiator with antifreeze.        

51
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,722
meanwhile, over in the paint department, 

52
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,891
robots are hard at work.    

53
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,065
they attach the painted pieces to the bike --         

54
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,867
first the saddlebag body, then the lid,         

55
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,803
and finally, the trunk body.  

56
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,205
then they assemble the instrumentation.      

57
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,007
the speedometer, fuel gauges, 

58
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,144
and many other things all go onto one unit.     

59
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,213
this part is called the front cowl,        

60
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,182
and it goes right in front of the instrumentation.    

61
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:53,058
they lower the front cowl with a meter panel onto the bike.  

62
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,367
and then they bolt everything to the frame.         

63
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,471
finally, they install a cover for the exhaust pipe.     

64
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,646
they check everything to make sure it's solidly put together.

65
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,786
and then they pull up to a dynamometer,       

66
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,188
a machine that measures mechanical power.       

67
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,930
they check the bike's speed, brakes, horn,         

68
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,766
navigation system, and the cruise control.    

69
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,208
every motorbike undergoes this scrutiny,    

70
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,845
and if it passes,       
it's ready for life on the road.

71
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,426
narrator: clay pipes are part of a major underground network,

72
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,829
one that's dedicated to proper drainage.       

73
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,397
we flush without thinking,   

74
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,365
but it may surprise you to learn            

75
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,901
that clay pipes have been serving us well   

76
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,169
for thousands of years,    

77
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,905
ever since the days of ancient babylonia.     

78
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,109
they're the sanitary sewer system's oldest secret.    

79
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,114
these pipes can take a lot of stress.   

80
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,316
they bear the weight of soil and structures overhead,    

81
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,685
and they won't corrode.    

82
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,790
they start with scrap clay from manufacturing,      

83
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,260
raw clay, and shale.      

84
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:38,196
after these materials have been roughly processed,  

85
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,532
a loader scoops the mix onto a conveyor        

86
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,268
that takes it to a mill for a finer grinding.     

87
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,579
at this point, the mix has about 10% natural moisture,  

88
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,682
but it's not enough for it to stick together,   

89
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,119
so they add more water as it falls into a mixer.   

90
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,492
the mixer evenly distributes the water in the mix,     

91
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,961
then moves it towards an extruder      

92
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,597
that pushes the clay through a pipe-shaped eye.   

93
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,239
the clay pipe that emerges is 7.8 inches in diameter,   

94
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,709
the size that typically serves a residential side street.   

95
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,511
it has a bell-shaped opening. 

96
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,446
it's the female part of a joint

97
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,715
that will fit to the male end of another pipe.        

98
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,928
a rotating blade trims away the ragged edges.  

99
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,397
then an automated system loads several pipes at a time 

100
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,834
onto a rack to await the next step.    

101
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,076
over on another production line,

102
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,979
they're making flue liners for chimneys.         

103
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,088
the clay is fairly soft at this point,         

104
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,491
so lettering wheels easily engrave information,  

105
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:16,361
and they can cut it to size using only a thin wire.    

106
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,902
an upender lift stacks it on a pallet     

107
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,471
to await further processing.  

108
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:33,311
elsewhere in the plant,    
a main trunk sewer pipe is born.

109
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,714
with a diameter of over 15 inches, it's big  

110
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,352
and needs a substantial trim job
to get rid of the rough edges. 

111
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,923
it weighs well over 660 pounds,

112
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,393
nearly five times that of the residential pipe.    

113
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,131
once they're fabricated,    

114
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,202
every clay pipe goes into a big
dryer for at least 24 hours.  

115
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,608
a trip through a kiln will toughen them up even more.

116
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,210
they'll spend about 50 hours in here,            

117
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,613
exposed to very high temperatures.    

118
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,882
this step is called vitrification.    

119
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,451
it fuses the mineral particles together.           

120
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:21,893
they tap each pipe with a hammer
to test it if it's solid...  

121
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,764
and perform a thorough visual inspection.       

122
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,906
to join lengths of pipe together,           

123
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,109
they pour polyester resin into the female joint molds  

124
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,912
that have been placed in the bell-shape pipes.    

125
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,381
the resin hardens, forming an o-ring,       

126
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,650
and the primer brushed on earlier       

127
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,720
helps the new resin joint adhere to the clay pipe.    

128
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,926
next, they make a male joint  

129
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,396
by pouring resin around its spigot end.     

130
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,533
this will make for a joint with a tight seal.       

131
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,183
they test the joints by pumping water into the pipe.

132
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,155
then they raise it as they place a load on the joint.   

133
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,792
how much pressure will     
this joint take without failing?

134
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:36,901
over a ton, which more than meets industry requirements.  

135
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,173
now they do another type of test
on a basic clay pipe.     

136
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,376
a hydraulic jack applies pressure on the pipe. 

137
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,645
the number on the gauge far exceeds the burden     

138
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,681
of being buried underground.  

139
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,119
and so these pipes are now ready
for civic duty         

140
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,155
down in the sewers.      

141
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,396
narrator: drumsticks are designed    

142
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,797
for a life of hard knocks.   

143
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,532
they're usually made of hickory,

144
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,202
which is heavier and sturdier than other woods.       

145
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,471
hickory can also absorb a lot of shock,        

146
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,606
which means a drumstick made from it          

147
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,675
is easier on the hands and wrists,          

148
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,378
so the drummer doesn't have to suffer for his music.     

149
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,092
hickory drumsticks also have good balance and feel,  

150
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,762
so it's easier to hit the right note.     

151
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,499
to make them, automated arms serve up hickory dowels    

152
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,436
to a three-bladed cutting device
that moves on a rail.     

153
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:50,174
as the blades shape the spinning
dowels, they form a round tip, 

154
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:55,346
a narrow shoulder, and a shaft that gradually widens.     

155
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,520
they spray each stick with a protective coating.   

156
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,665
these round blades lob off the stubs,       

157
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,801
the ends where the sticks were held           

158
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,570
during their initial machining.

159
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,475
it's just a rough trim, and the ends need more work.  

160
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,278
so they feed them to spinning chucks with blades.

161
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,148
the chucks are inside a protective metal housing   

162
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,319
because they spin very fast and
the blades are extremely sharp.

163
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,761
for a demonstration,      

164
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,965
the housing on one of the chucks
has been removed,       

165
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,499
and they turn it by hand.   

166
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,236
the chuck usually rotates at 10,000 rpm,         

167
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,703
but at this slow speed,    

168
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,541
you can see just how it shaves an end into the desired shape. 

169
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,649
the stick comes out of the chuck
with a nicely rounded tip.   

170
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,989
now they test the sticks.   

171
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,257
each one rolls down steel rails

172
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,994
that have been specially aligned.       

173
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,734
if it rolls straight, it means the stick is straight.

174
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,469
but if it wobbles, it isn't  

175
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,937
and would be impossible to play with.         

176
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,140
they reject those sticks.   

177
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,378
next, a printer embosses the brand name and model number

178
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,181
onto each of the drumsticks.  

179
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,895
now they sort each drumstick by weight.           

180
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,830
even if two sticks have been made         

181
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,498
exactly the same shape and size,

182
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,635
their weight can vary because wood has different densities, 

183
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,837
and that's something      

184
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,172
that affects the stick's feel and tone.           

185
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,477
for example, this drumstick weighs 53 grams.

186
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,116
but the next one comes in at 55.

187
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,254
over at another work station, 

188
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,258
they're making a different kind
of drumstick --        

189
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,294
a felt-tip mount that will have a softer sound. 

190
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,999
they press a wooden shaft   

191
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,801
into the glue-filled hole of the felt ball.       

192
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,137
the hole is a bit smaller than the shaft,        

193
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,539
resulting in a tight bond   

194
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,308
between the stick and felt head.         

195
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,620
they do a sound check on the other sticks.      

196
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,961
even though they've been sorted
by weight,           

197
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,697
there are still subtle differences in tone.  

198
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,668
a computer analyzes their sound
and matches pairs.       

199
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,509
it's a bit like a dating game. 

200
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,312
the unmated sticks go back into the mix,     

201
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,781
and they try to match them up again.    

202
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,989
this matching process is critical.          

203
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,991
if one stick has a different pitch,     

204
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,460
the sound will be off-balance. 

205
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:33,965
they assign a numerical value to each pair of drumsticks.  

206
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,277
a cardboard sleeve holds each matched pair together.  

207
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,418
from a rough wooden dowel to a sleek drumstick,     

208
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,322
a process that's designed for impact.          

209
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,901
narrator: when you blow into a whistle, 

210
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,905
part of the air stream exits the slot in a swirling motion, 

211
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,172
generating sound.       

212
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,573
the rest of the air stream   

213
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,509
travels through the whistle chamber,      

214
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,844
then exits the slot, reinforcing the sound.     

215
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,313
the little ball rolling inside 

216
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,382
puts the trill in the whistle blast.     

217
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,651
quality whistles are made of solid brass    

218
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,619
because nothing beats its resonance.         

219
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,991
[ whistle blows ]       

220
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,330
production begins with a narrow brass sheet   

221
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,133
not quite 4/100 of an inch thick.             

222
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,535
a punch press slices through the sheet,   

223
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,071
cutting a square connected to two circles.   

224
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,708
the factory calls these pieces the mickey mouse ears.     

225
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,680
one by one they go into a second press  

226
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,281
that folds the circles inward 

227
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,550
to form the sides of the whistle's barrel    

228
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,019
and bends the edges of the square inward      

229
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,622
to form the top and sides of the mouthpiece.       

230
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:08,159
at the same time, it strikes the mouthpiece against a die  

231
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,095
that embosses the company logo into the metal.        

232
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,972
another brass sheet feeds a third press.      

233
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,042
this machine punches out and partially shapes the part 

234
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,177
that forms the rest of the whistle.        

235
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,513
it notches the tapered end,  

236
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,982
which will be the underside of the mouthpiece,       

237
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:32,884
giving your teeth something to grip.       

238
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,189
now a fourth press finishes shaping these pieces. 

239
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,359
it bends the other end into a circle to form the barrel.  

240
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,466
the two main parts of the whistle are now ready. 

241
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,868
a worker snaps them together with pliers.          

242
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,139
note that on the bottom piece the barrel stops short     

243
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,408
of meeting the top of the mouthpiece.       

244
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,710
this creates the whistle's air slot.    

245
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,766
this press cuts and folds a brass sheet    

246
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,169
into the third and final part of the whistle, called the tip.

247
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,770
it's a piece on the back    

248
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,040
that holds a ring for hanging the whistle.    

249
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,713
the tips go into a bowl feeder.

250
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,582
the vibration orients them in the same direction     

251
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,918
so that a robotic arm can pick them up        

252
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,321
and put them in a holder.   

253
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,993
tin and silver solder is applied to each tip.    

254
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:51,462
this will bond it to the whistle.        

255
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,347
to fuse all the parts together,

256
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,784
solder is applied in six different spots.    

257
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,028
the solder liquifies      

258
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,032
as a gas flame heats it to about
1,100 degrees fahrenheit.   

259
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,967
it flows around all the seams, 

260
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,636
filling them in a matter of seconds.    

261
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,173
a blast of cold air solidifies the solder.     

262
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,842
even then, it's still steaming 

263
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,344
as the whistle comes off the machine.     

264
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,518
the ball that goes inside the barrel        

265
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,386
is about a half inch in diameter

266
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,856
and made of synthetic cork, which doesn't absorb moisture, 

267
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,125
so the ball never gets soggy and stuck.           

268
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,462
a worker holds each whistle, now plated with nickel,    

269
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,331
against the insertion machine. 

270
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,466
the device works like these pliers,       

271
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,336
squeezing a ball through the whistle's air slot.     

272
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,674
with one side of the barrel cut away,           

273
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,343
you can see how the ball regains its shape       

274
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,078
as soon as it clears the slot. 

275
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,217
the last step is to hook a steel ring onto each tip.  

276
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,159
the factory packages its whistles          

277
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,428
with a nylon cord called a lanyard.       

278
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,998
a hook on one end attaches to the whistle's ring.     

279
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,708
another accessory in the package

280
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,044
is a rubber cover for the mouthpiece.      

281
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,780
it makes holding the whistle in your mouth for a long time 

282
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,082
more comfortable.       

283
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,722
this factory also makes customized whistles.      

284
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,124
you can order them with your own logo.      

285
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,160
or to really blow someone away,
you can present them      

286
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,330
with a 24-karat gold-plated award whistle.
