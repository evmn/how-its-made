00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,718
narrator: paper umbrellas originated in china       

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,253
and eventually spread throughout asia.         

5
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,190
initially, their purpose was solely practical --     

6
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,725
to protect against rain     

7
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,461
and to provide shade from the scorching sun.     

8
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,932
but before long, they took on symbolic significance      

9
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,635
and were incorporated into many ceremonies and rituals.   

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,407
they're called oil paper umbrellas       

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,910
because the paper is coated with oil        

12
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,145
or, like these, with oil paint,             

13
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,749
making the umbrella waterproof.           

14
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,352
at this workshop in northern thailand,      

15
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,088
they cut a bamboo log to the length          

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,556
of the umbrella's radius,    

17
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,491
then shave off the bark.     

18
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:37,696
they split the log into strips of equal thickness,       

19
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,298
then group these ribs, as they're called,        

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,299
into bundles of 28.       

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:45,303
each bundle will become the frame of one umbrella.    

22
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,974
next, they thin out the bottom half of each rib   

23
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,976
and cut a slit in the top half.              

24
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,511
then, using a traditional drill,             

25
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:57,983
they bore            
tiny holes at specific points.  

26
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,118
taking one bundle at a time,   

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,588
they string the ribs together through the uppermost hole    

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,259
and insert them into slots of a hand-carved wooden hub.   

29
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,995
then they tighten and tie off the string            

30
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,265
to retain the ribs in position and provide a pivot       

31
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,233
on which the ribs can move up and down.           

32
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,204
next, they attach the scaffold,            

33
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,874
a smaller hub with shorter ribs strung on it.               

34
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:26,345
they insert a scaffold rib into the slit of each frame rib,              

35
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,147
then attach them by threading a string             

36
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,549
through the aligned holes.    

37
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,751
the result?           

38
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,552
raising and lowering the scaffold           

39
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,555
moves its ribs along the slit --               

40
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,891
pushing the frame ribs up to open the umbrella,      

41
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,294
or pulling them down to close it.           

42
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,630
with the umbrella open now,   

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,034
they thread more string through holes in the frame ribs              

44
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,637
and loop it into a spider-web-type pattern.    

45
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,839
this produces a sturdy base   

46
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,642
to support the umbrella's paper skin.    

47
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,844
after mounting the frame     

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,846
on a wood and bamboo umbrella handle,         

49
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:05,050
they wrap two lines of string along the frame perimeter.    

50
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,120
this will support the paper skin at the edge of the umbrella.   

51
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,524
they make the paper from the bark of the native saa tree.              

52
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,193
the first step is to soften the bark      

53
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,862
by soaking it in water for about 12 hours,       

54
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,365
then boiling it for another three or four.    

55
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,804
next, they mash it with wooden mallets       

56
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,073
for about an hour, turning it into pulp.      

57
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,546
they bleach the pulp and wash it again to remove the bleach.   

58
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:37,216
only then is the pulp ready to become paper.         

59
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,489
they dump the pulp in a large basin of water    

60
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,825
and stir so that it floats in suspension           

61
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,961
while they move a plastic screen through the water,        

62
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,830
catching enough floating pulp  

63
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,065
to coat the screen in a thin layer.         

64
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,903
they lay the screen out in the sun          

65
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,437
for three to four hours     

66
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,839
until the layer of pulp     

67
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,242
dries into a thin, fragile sheet of paper.            

68
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,045
they cut the sheets to the shapes required,     

69
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,649
then saturate each piece with glue made from cassava,   

70
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,451
a tropical root vegetable.    

71
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:15,654
after applying a circular piece around the hub,         

72
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:19,058
they glue pie-shaped pieces onto the rest of the frame.   

73
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,463
once they cover the entire frame,        

74
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,134
they repeat the process to add a second layer.      

75
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,136
they fold all the pie-shaped pieces    

76
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,538
over the end to thicken     

77
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,808
and, thereby, reinforce the edge of the umbrella.    

78
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,212
after about four hours out in the sun, the glue dries,             

79
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,881
bonding the now stiff and strengthened paper      

80
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,683
securely to the frame.      

81
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,220
they apply three coats of oil paint,    

82
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,891
allowing four hours of drying time between coats.  

83
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,359
this is a key step        

84
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:56,428
because aside from providing the background color,      

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,231
the oil paint waterproofs the paper.            

86
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,234
next, they varnish the handle  
to make it moisture-resistant.  

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,039
and now for the grand finale --               

88
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:13,511
an artist paints a design in vibrant waterproof oils.   

89
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,047
the themes are traditional --  

90
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:21,854
flowers, animals, landscapes, people.       

91
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:25,790
no stencils to trace or patterns to follow --     

92
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,127
the artist works entirely freehand,        

93
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,529
the result being that no two umbrellas      

94
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,499
are ever exactly alike.     

95
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,872
each oil paper umbrella is a portable work of art.    

96
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:44,777
pretty yet practical, rain or shine.          

97
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,695
narrator: the most-used fuel   

98
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,965
for producing electricity in the world today is coal.   

99
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,633
power plants burn it in their furnaces        

100
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,235
to heat water into steam     

101
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,639
that spins giant turbines which generate electricity.   

102
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,374
at least 40% of the world's electricity    

103
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,911
is produced by coal-fired power plants.   

104
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:23,916
coal developed from prehistoric vegetation   

105
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,786
that wound up buried underground due to geological changes.    

106
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,521
over millions of years,     

107
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:33,525
these decayed plants transformed into combustible rock.      

108
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,195
this is why we refer to coal as a fossil fuel.        

109
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,466
coal runs in seams through other rock layers.    

110
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,534
miners drill holes through the seam         

111
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,402
at several locations,      

112
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,473
then mix together ammonium nitrate and diesel   

113
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:50,542
and pour a precise quantity of this liquid explosive     

114
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,078
into each bored hole.      

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,216
the plug the holes with dirt to contain the upcoming explosion.           

116
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,952
this directs the force of the blast sideways      

117
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,820
so that it'll fracture rock   

118
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,356
as much horizontally as vertically.          

119
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:08,027
they place a blasting cap in each plugged hole,      

120
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,894
then connect all the blasting cap wires    

121
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,629
to detonation lines       

122
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,300
through which they'll send an electrical charge       

123
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,768
to ignite the explosives.    

124
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,635
they install detonation delays  

125
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,972
to time the blast one after another        

126
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:23,108
because successive explosions have greater impact       

127
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,777
than simultaneous ones.     

128
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,316
the blast dislodge and break up the layers of rock              

129
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,519
between the surface and the coal seam deep below.  

130
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,189
workers clear away the rocks and dirt        

131
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,925
with a mammoth machine called a dragline.        

132
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,071
removing the blasted rock and dirt exposes the coal,    

133
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,840
which is still a solid, hard seam.       

134
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,344
the side of the mine pit     

135
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,948
shows how much rock is on top of this particular coal seam.  

136
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,818
once miners blast and clear away that rock,    

137
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,688
they drill and load the holes to set off more explosives    

138
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,024
to fracture the coal seam itself.      

139
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,160
then front-end loaders load the coal             

140
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,431
into specialized trucks called coal haulers.       

141
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:24,436
in one trip, a coal hauler can transport about 220 tons of coal              

142
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,406
out of the pit to the coal stockpile.      

143
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,113
from there,           

144
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,116
railcars transport the coal to the nearby power plant.    

145
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,922
when this company prepares to mine an area,         

146
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:47,126
it removes the topsoil on which vegetation grows.    

147
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,727
as part             
of a land reclamation program,  

148
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,197
the company stockpiles the topsoil           

149
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,532
until it finishes mining out the coal.       

150
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,401
then it refills the pit     

151
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,004
with rock and dirt it blasted away,         

152
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:02,441
returns the topsoil, and plants native vegetation.  

153
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,546
the power plant is situated by a man-made lake,       

154
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,149
the water source for the steam  

155
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:13,652
with which it generates electricity.           

156
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,821
when the coal arrives,      

157
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,757
crushers grind it up into baseball-sized pieces.   

158
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,961
after a strategic blending of different grades of coal,   

159
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,430
to optimize heat output,     

160
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:27,766
the coal travels by a conveyor belt to indoor silos.             

161
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:34,506
each silo feeds crushers, which pulverize the coal into powder.             

162
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,843
now the coal is ready to fuel the furnace.       

163
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:43,115
meanwhile, huge intake pumps draw lake water.         

164
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,652
the furnace heats        
the water to 1,000 fahrenheit,  

165
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,653
well beyond the boiling point,  

166
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,657
transforming it into high-pressure steam.       

167
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,460
the steam then enters and rotates turbines,      

168
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,929
generating electricity.     

169
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,365
by the time the steam exits the turbines,  

170
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:05,203
it's thermally depleted down to just 120 fahrenheit   

171
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,807
and depressurized to a vacuum state.        

172
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,009
it then passes through a condenser           

173
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,744
containing cold lake water.   

174
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,013
the water absorbs the remaining heat,       

175
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,482
converting the steam back to water,          

176
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,686
which is then recycled into new steam.         

177
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,959
the combustion process itself creates sulfur dioxide.     

178
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,094
the plant runs this gas waste  

179
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:32,297
through vessels containing a lime solution         

180
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,099
to neutralize the sulfur.    

181
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,836
this chemical reaction creates water vapor,           

182
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,572
which exits the plant's stack.  

183
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,908
wires coming off the turbine generators      

184
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,777
carry the electricity to outdoor transformers.     

185
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,780
the outdoor transformers convert it to higher voltage       

186
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,916
in order to have less energy loss,        

187
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,319
as the power from coal travels through transmission lines    

188
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,123
to some 350,000 households.   

189
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,471
narrator: when you're traveling by air,  

190
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,941
you want to be sitting in a comfortable seat.      

191
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,477
private aircraft take comfort to a level            

192
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,612
far above that of commercial airlines      

193
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,148
with seats           
that are as cozy and luxurious  

194
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,883
as fine furniture.        

195
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:30,088
they must also be lightweight and fire-resistant.       

196
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,025
on private and corporate aircraft,     

197
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,360
it's all about luxury seating.  

198
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,230
armchairs often swivel and, at the push of a button,  

199
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,566
recline with an extending footrest.   

200
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,370
the cushions are constructed from layers of fireproof foam  

201
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,972
containing carbon fiber     

202
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,641
for optimum support and durability.         

203
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:52,710
workers cut the cushion pieces using a band saw         

204
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,180
with a round blade that slices through foam     

205
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,048
without tearing or shredding it.               

206
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,718
they spray adjoining surfaces with water-based contact cement             

207
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
and assemble them.        

208
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,590
the assembly combines different thicknesses      

209
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,125
and three different densities  

210
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,861
to make the cushion soft in certain areas         

211
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,262
and rigid in others.       

212
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,598
the densities are color-coded.  

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,669
after letting the glue dry for 12 hours,    

214
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,738
workers begin the final shaping.            

215
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,207
this is the seat-cushion assembly.    

216
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,943
they first saw through it laterally            

217
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,478
to make the right thickness.   

218
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,081
then they temporarily adhere a plastic template        

219
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,750
of the final cushion shape,   

220
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,686
trace it, then saw along the trace line.      

221
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,756
next, using the technical drawing as a guide,       

222
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,094
they mark, then grind      
the cushion's rounded profile.  

223
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,896
holding the next layer of foam over the edge,          

224
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,833
they verify the shape with another template.      

225
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,967
then with yet another template,            

226
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,104
they mark lines for the cushion's creases    

227
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,973
and, with a foam saw, cut them two inches deep,    

228
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,710
just enough to insert velcro strips,          

229
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,646
the backsides of which they glue to the foam           

230
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,949
with water-based contact cement.             

231
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,320
workers construct the backrest cushion       

232
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:09,454
just like the seat cushion --  

233
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,389
assembling foam pieces      

234
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,991
of different thicknesses and densities,          

235
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,062
shaping the perimeter, grinding the edge profile,    

236
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,164
cutting and velcroing creases.  

237
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:26,437
then they apply a final layer of soft foam, 1/2 inch thick,  

238
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,941
folding the edges onto     
the velcro inside the creases.  

239
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,345
they do the same with the seat cushion, armrests, and footrest.            

240
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,415
all the foam cushions      

241
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,951
are now ready to be covered in genuine leather.       

242
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,621
in accordance with safety regulations,     

243
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,956
the supplier rendered the leather fireproof      

244
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,592
by treating it         
with a calcium-based solution.  

245
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,097
seamstresses trace patterns for the cover pieces,      

246
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,800
then cut them out.        

247
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,304
they line the perimeter of each piece          

248
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,739
with double-faced tape...    

249
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,079
...fold over the edges to create a neat hem...     

250
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,583
...and trim the corners flat.  

251
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:16,455
then they sew on velcro strips where required.         

252
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,394
finally, they assemble the pieces into covers,     

253
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,430
sewing an identification label on each one.           

254
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:34,406
they hammer every seam flat to prevent bulges.        

255
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:37,742
then they sew          
what's called a french stitch,  

256
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,880
a line of straight stitches on either side of each seam.   

257
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:46,418
meanwhile, workers glue fireproof polyester batting   

258
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,686
to the foam.           

259
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:50,021
this layer between foam and leather     

260
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,224
will even out the surface.    

261
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:59,964
they tear the perimeter     
of the batting to thin it out.  

262
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:04,035
finally, it's time to dress the cushions in their covers.  

263
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,370
workers use a metal rod     

264
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,972
to help push the leather deep into the creases      

265
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,308
without bunching up.       

266
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,110
velcro strips on the cover    

267
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,046
adhere to the velcro strips inside the creases.       

268
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:18,183
the covers also have velcro closures,         

269
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:21,786
and certain cushions have velcro strips on the bottom   

270
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,790
which attach to the seat structure.      

271
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,792
once all the covers are on,   

272
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:29,394
workers can complete the seat assembly.        

273
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:34,098
they attach the armrest to the structure with screws,  

274
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,136
then install the footrest, which attaches with velcro.   

275
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,339
it contains a cavity for storing the life vest.    

276
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,345
the seat cushion also attaches with velcro.           

277
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,017
the passenger seats and pilot seat          

278
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,153
are constructed the same way,  

279
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:59,090
except for the pilot seat often has a sheepskin insert   

280
00:15:59,092 --> 00:15:59,891
on the sitting surface      

281
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,693
to absorb sweat         

282
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,429
and keep the pilot cool and comfortable.      

283
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,647
narrator: it was the ancient romans    

284
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,416
who first began using cremation urns.      

285
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,452
today the custom continues.   

286
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,455
the remains are stored in urns permanently           

287
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,391
or sometimes temporarily before burial.          

288
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,992
and with cremation,       

289
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,728
one's final resting place    

290
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,498
doesn't have to be six feet under.        

291
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,737
the cremation urn has an important place        

292
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,004
in some households.       

293
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,275
it's a constant reminder of the dearly departed,     

294
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,878
helping to keep the memories alive.       

295
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,548
the urn starts with a concept.  

296
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,151
the potter draws a large-scale design,      

297
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,153
which he'll use as a reference  

298
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:06,390
as he shapes a prototype urn from clay.            

299
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,294
he slaps a lump of clay onto the potter's wheel.     

300
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,095
the wheel spins,         

301
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,832
and the potter begins to transform the shapeless lump              

302
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,667
into the desired form.      

303
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:24,242
the process is called throwing, a potter's term for shaping.   

304
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,111
he leaves the bottom open    

305
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:30,781
so the walls can be more easily             
formed into the desired shape.  

306
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,852
he'll add a base to the urn later.     

307
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:36,921
as he pulls up the clay to produce the walls,      

308
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,325
he works it to a uniformed thickness.    

309
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,060
he gathers top to narrow the opening,      

310
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,829
a technique known as collaring.           

311
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,468
then with the potter's wheel at a stop,            

312
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,005
he takes the shape from round to rectangular          

313
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,208
and tapers it at the neck.    

314
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,144
then it's into a casting box,  

315
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:02,480
which exposes only half of the urn prototype.           

316
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,616
he brushes a release agent onto that half.              

317
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,220
using a mixer, he whips up a mix of plaster and water.   

318
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,023
he blends it until it thickens  

319
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,359
to the consistency of pancake batter.        

320
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,495
the liquefied plaster will harden in minutes,     

321
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,697
so he quickly pours it into the box           

322
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,299
with the urn prototype      

323
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,434
and fills it right to the top.  

324
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,771
as the plaster hardens,     

325
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:31,042
the exposed urn prototype makes             
an impression of half the urn.  

326
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,778
he'll make another one exactly like it   

327
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
for the other half of the urn.  

328
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,253
he'll attach them with a key system.        

329
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,724
for this, he drills notches in one mold half.        

330
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,863
the notches match up with raised areas        

331
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,765
on the other mold half to align them.          

332
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,271
he ties the molds together with suspender-like straps,   

333
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,741
cinching them tightly together.            

334
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,012
he adds a base to the urn    

335
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:08,879
and straps it to the other two pieces.     

336
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,616
he sets the assembled mold upright,   

337
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,221
exposing the opening of the urn.              

338
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:19,557
he's now ready to make a copy of the original urn.       

339
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,759
in fact, he'll make 20 at once  

340
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,696
using 20 identical plaster molds.          

341
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:28,967
he pumps liquid clay into each one, filling it to the brim.   

342
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,234
over three to four hours,    

343
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,170
the plaster absorbs water    

344
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,772
in the clay it comes into contact with,   

345
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,507
causing it to solidify.     

346
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,710
the clay in the center remains liquid.         

347
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:42,213
he pours that into a barrel to be strained and reused.    

348
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,719
and now the big reveal --    

349
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:51,723
he opens the mold and removes the urn.       

350
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:57,461
it's exactly like the prototype sculpted by the potter.     

351
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,799
he lifts a lid from another plaster mold    

352
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,567
and checks the fit to the urn.  

353
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,007
after drying and an initial firing      

354
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,407
to harden the clay,       

355
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,477
a worker coats the urn and lid with a glaze,      

356
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,749
working from the inside out.   

357
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,752
the glaze is a mixture of finely milled minerals and water.    

358
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:24,088
it adds color and        
a glass-like nonporous surface  

359
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,891
when fired a second time.    

360
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,561
cremation urns come in a range of styles and colors.             

361
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,963
customers often make a selection            

362
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:37,168
that reflects the taste of the deceased.    

363
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,172
another worker now brushes a mixture of wax and alumina   

364
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,541
onto the neck of the urn and lid.             

365
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,309
this will keep them from fusing together       

366
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,411
during the final firing.     

367
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,048
they fire the cremation urns   

368
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,118
at a very intense 2,200 fahrenheit         

369
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,387
for about 15 hours.       

370
00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:01,926
this transforms the clay into a durable ceramic.     

371
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:06,463
they cool the urns slowly for 13 hours to prevent cracking.  

372
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,667
four days in the making,     

373
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,938
these urns are now ready to contain a loved one's remains             

374
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,174
and, in so doing, honor a life.
