narrator: bit by bit,     

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,454
the screwdriver makes the life of a handyman     

5
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,788
a whole lot easier.      

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,657
the screwdriver first showed up

7
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,126
in the early part of the 19th century.      

8
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,464
it evolved from a flat-bladed 
bit used in a carpenter's brace,

9
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,667
and its invention was a definite turning point. 

10
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,944
these trusty tools come with different bits    

11
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,880
to fit a variety of screwheads,

12
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,683
so all you have to do is apply the right torque,   

13
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,518
and it's mission accomplished. 

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,490
the job of making screwdrivers 

15
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,826
starts with coils of specially formulated steel. 

16
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,828
wheels straighten a thick wire,

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,365
and then it travels through an aperture.      

18
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,835
on the other side, a machine rocks back and forth 

19
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:48,073
as it cuts the wire to length 
and forces it through four dies.

20
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:55,113
the first die narrows the steel
to the required diameter.   

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,316
the others form a hexagonal bolster partway down.     

22
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,454
this bolster will allow a wrench
to be applied to the screwdriver

23
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,257
to increase its turning power. 

24
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,127
a quick shower washes away the lubricant,   

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,331
and these screwdriver shafts are ready for inspection.   

26
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,736
the technician examines them for defects          

27
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,338
and measures the length and the dimensions       

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,840
of the hexagonal bolster.   

29
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,945
once he confirms that everything
is to specification,      

30
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,948
the screwdriver shafts head into a machine      

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,218
that will transform the tips into a slotted shape.     

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,556
at the first two stations, the press flattens the tip.  

33
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,294
the third one trims it and stamps the part number onto it.

34
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,769
the flat blade is probably   
the most common of screwdrivers.

35
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,173
its chiseled tip turns a standard slotted screw.

36
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,110
after the screwdrivers are heat-treated        

37
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,978
to increase their hardness,  

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,715
they sand the tips to shave off
.1 of a millimeter.      

39
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,452
they confirm that with this slotted guide.    

40
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,454
then they insert the screwdrivers        

41
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,189
into a different slotted device.

42
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,326
this one shuttles them over to a grinding wheel.   

43
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,198
this wheel trims them to their final dimensions.   

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,400
visually, the change is subtle,

45
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,870
but this fine-tuning will make a big difference   

46
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,540
in the screwdrivers' performance.          

47
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,074
now they twirl in a machine  

48
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,544
that blasts the tips with mild abrasive.       

49
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,080
this texturizes the surface  

50
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:41,353
to allow this screwdriver to really grip a screwhead.  

51
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,823
the texturized tip is the one on the right.    

52
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,491
over at another station,    

53
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,628
a different kind of screwdriver
is taking shape.        

54
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,896
this is a phillips.      

55
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,165
its tip has a beveled cross point     

56
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:58,036
to correspond with a phillips screw.     

57
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,439
this machine carves ridges into
the bevels of the cross point 

58
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,243
to give it extra gripping power.

59
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:09,381
a press then slams into    
the other end of the screwdriver

60
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,316
to create flanged grooves.   

61
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,451
these grooves will allow them 

62
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,988
to lock the screwdriver shaft into its handle.        

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,190
it's time for some positive vibrations.      

64
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,525
this vibrating feeder     

65
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,728
causes the screwdrivers to chafe against each other,  

66
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,332
and the action removes any waste material.      

67
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,002
after they texturize the cross-point tip,      

68
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,472
it's over to a laser machine. 

69
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:38,410
it etches the part numbers onto
these polyurethane handles.  

70
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,612
and now for the gripping part. 

71
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,149
the assembler attaches the   
handle to the screwdriver blade.

72
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,085
he then places the screwdriver in a machine          

73
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,020
that applies mechanical force 

74
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,957
to solidly entrench the shaft in the handle.    

75
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,960
with the screwdrivers now on a tray,         

76
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,896
they move through a curtain of plastic.     

77
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,866
a machine heat-seals the plastic
around the edges.       

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,438
the loosely wrapped tray then enters a special furnace, 

79
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,441
and the heat shrinks the plastic around the tray  

80
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,443
to neatly wrap up this job.  

81
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:15,247
it has taken several days to make these screwdrivers,  

82
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:19,518
and now they're ready for   
the twists and turns of any job.

83
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,054
tools like these screwdrivers 

84
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,990
are really an extension of the human hand.       

85
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,860
a quality tool will enable you to work with more precision,  

86
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,194
but, of course,        

87
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,731
you have to grasp the fundamentals of your project. 

88
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,133
and depending on what kind of handyman you are,      

89
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,836
that could be a whole other story.      

90
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,883
narrator: compact track loaders
move materials like dirt,   

91
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,284
gravel, and even snow     

92
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,354
into a dump truck or any other type of machinery.

93
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,957
the rubber tracks give them the traction to work hard   

94
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,162
while treading lightly over soft
ground conditions like grass. 

95
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,199
compact track loaders can be used year round.    

96
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:14,906
compact track loaders give a smooth and stable ride 

97
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,708
over all sorts of terrain.   

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,110
their rubber tracks and suspension         

99
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,845
allow them to turn on a dime  

100
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,882
and work in places where other machines can't.  

101
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,522
to start, technicians attach four sets of mid wheels    

102
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:31,723
to a frame rail.        

103
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,459
the wheels are made of plastic and rubber.     

104
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,862
then they assemble the axle suspension      

105
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,998
using rubber cords so the wheels
can flex up and down.     

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,934
they tighten the bolts and mark them as done.     

107
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,943
after they attach two more sets
of mid wheels,         

108
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,080
what's called the frame-rail assembly is complete.     

109
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,889
technicians then attach a turnbuckle to the frame rail. 

110
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,557
the turnbuckle will be used  

111
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,759
to tighten or loosen the rubber track.       

112
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,567
next, they put together the drive sprocket assembly -- 

113
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,569
the part that drives the track.

114
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,840
they put a drive motor into a housing,        

115
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:26,778
add the sprocket assembly, then
put on a heavy-duty bearing.  

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,714
finally, they install a support plate  

117
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,784
which completes the drive-motor assembly.   

118
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,787
a technician then mounts the drive-motor assembly    

119
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,589
onto the frame-rail assembly. 

120
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,794
technicians install the rubber track        

121
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,596
onto the frame-rail assembly. 

122
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:48,667
a little lubrication makes the track go on easier  

123
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,268
until its molded lugs interlock

124
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,070
with the drive-sprocket assembly.           

125
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,075
next comes a larger idler wheel,

126
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,145
which they install at the end of the track,    

127
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,814
securing it on the axle.    

128
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,619
he tightens the turnbuckle   

129
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,821
to give the rubber track the correct tension,      

130
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,623
completing the undercarriage assembly.  

131
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,461
the track loader will ride on two of these undercarriages.

132
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,502
a technician installs the machine's main suspension 

133
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,572
onto the chassis, then connects
the hydraulic-valve assembly. 

134
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,641
it's the hub to which they connect all the hydraulic lines

135
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,378
and hoses used to control the machine.  

136
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,919
using a crane,         

137
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,856
the technician mounts the engine
to the chassis.        

138
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,858
once the engine is secure,   

139
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,596
he puts on the integrated fuel tank.   

140
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,199
he installs a hydraulic cylinder

141
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,068
and connects its two fluid lines.      

142
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,870
one cylinder goes on each side of the machine.        

143
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,008
they are used to move the loader bucket up and down. 

144
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,215
he then connects the undercarriage assembly   

145
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,351
to the chassis using an undercarriage pin   

146
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,821
and pneumatic wrench to secure it in place.     

147
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,697
a technician now installs the loader assembly --     

148
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,235
the part that holds the bucket or other attachment.      

149
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,438
once installed, this machine can lift more than 3 tons.   

150
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,746
he secures the assembly in place
using heavy-duty pins.     

151
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,318
then technicians install the operator's station     

152
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,988
that helps protect the driver from the elements       

153
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,057
and from debris.        

154
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,532
a technician makes sure the loader arm works properly, 

155
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,735
then drives the track loader on a treadmill         

156
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,570
to test all the systems.    

157
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,342
he runs the engine at full speed

158
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,944
until it reaches the appropriate
operating temperature.     

159
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,248
this shows that everything is working as it should.    

160
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,757
finally, he affixes the company logo.       

161
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,762
compact track loaders are strong and agile machines. 

162
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,565
they work just as well on dry surfaces        

163
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,401
as they do in wet and muddy conditions.  

164
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,848
narrator: stepping onto    
the scale at the doctor's office

165
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,450
is a moment of truth not everyone enjoys.      

166
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,787
little has changed in the simple design of these scales 

167
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,121
since the early 1900s.     

168
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,924
cast iron has given way to steel and aluminum.     

169
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,327
that means they've actually gotten lighter over the years, 

170
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,430
unlike some of us.       

171
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,871
this scale compares the weight placed on the platform     

172
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,339
with a standard weight known as a poise        

173
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,810
that slides along an off-center
waybeam until it balances.   

174
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,150
a punch press forms sheet steel
into the head,         

175
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,187
or top of the scale's column. 

176
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,027
workers form the column from another piece of steel  

177
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,696
using this press brake.    

178
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,968
then they spot-weld the head and column together.      

179
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,311
another machine stamps out lengths of steel        

180
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,981
that will form the frame for the scale's base.     

181
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,857
workers use the press brake again     

182
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,726
to bend both sides of the steel lengths.     

183
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,863
then they fold it by hand to form the frame.       

184
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,004
they clamp the frame onto a base,          

185
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,274
and this robot welds them together.      

186
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:27,812
the robot moves on to weld other components to the scale, 

187
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,882
such as the lever mechanism and the baseplate.       

188
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,957
now workers place steel bearings
at each corner of the base,  

189
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,026
where the lever mechanism will rest           

190
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,996
then add the base frame.    

191
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,968
next, they install the long lever...        

192
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,570
then the short lever.     

193
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,842
a c-clip joins them together. 

194
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,110
once it's right-side up,    

195
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,114
the lever mechanism hangs off the platform.    

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,585
the columns receive a coat of electrostatically charged paint

197
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,923
that evenly coats the metal for a flawless finish.     

198
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,257
once it's dry,         

199
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,729
a machine silk-screens the brand name onto the column.

200
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,997
now for the final assembly.  

201
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,934
a worker inserts a 4-foot steel rod       

202
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,403
that will tie the waybeam to the levers.         

203
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,407
he works the rod up through the column,     

204
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,342
then, at the column's head,  

205
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,078
he screws it to the waybeam's shelf.    

206
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,352
another worker hammers the large poise    

207
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:45,089
into position on the waybeam, then the smaller poise.    

208
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,694
they screw on to the beam in two
parts so they can glide freely. 

209
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,562
she applies a gauge onto the beam         

210
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,932
that indicates the weight measured in pounds       

211
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,834
from 0 to 350.         

212
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,704
now she takes a zero-adjustment screw    

213
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,440
and spring-loads it onto the beam.         

214
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:06,845
this allows the beam to balance
when the poises are set at zero

215
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,913
and the scale is unweighted.  

216
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,085
a retaining ring holds the screw in place.   

217
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,991
at the assembly line,     

218
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,127
workers fasten the scale's column to its base.      

219
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,539
they cover the pivot to protect it from wear    

220
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:39,344
and set down the waybeam that balances on it.      

221
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,346
then they connect it to the steel rod        

222
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,715
that comes up through the column
from the base.         

223
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,220
once the waybeam connects to  
the lever mechanism at the base,

224
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,821
the scale is functional.    

225
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,625
now it's time to make sure it's accurate.         

226
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,562
each scale goes to a weigh station    

227
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,300
where workers check the readings
in 44-pound increments.    

228
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,834
if the readings are off,    

229
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,638
workers go back and remove some 
lead from inside the large poise

230
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,042
so the scale calibrates perfectly.     

231
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,310
just a few grams of lead    

232
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,178
can make all the difference in accuracy.          

233
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,325
finally, they place a plastic cover over the working parts, 

234
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,361
and the scale is complete.   

235
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,244
narrator: when the competition is stiff, 

236
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,747
sometimes it helps to be a little flexible,       

237
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:54,151
and that's the idea behind the carbon-fiber softball bat. 

238
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,288
manufacturers can tweak the stiffness of carbon fiber 

239
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,557
to produce a bat with some elasticity.     

240
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,726
it's a striking innovation.  

241
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,566
carbon bats are a high-tech way to improve your game.   

242
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,239
incredibly, these hard-hitting bats    

243
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,975
start with pliable sheets of carbon-fiber        

244
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,378
infused with a special resin. 

245
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,114
they crisscross the sheets   

246
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:26,117
and then iron the side with a paper liner       

247
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,419
to melt the layers at the seams.

248
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,993
a hot steel roller then applies
some serious pressure     

249
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,464
to fuse the carbon-fiber layers together.        

250
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,367
they slice it to size.     

251
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,405
now they peel away that paper liner        

252
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,809
and spiral the carbon fiber around a steel bat form.    

253
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,344
by changing the angle of the weave,         

254
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,081
they can fine-tune the bat's elasticity      

255
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,616
to a league's specifications  

256
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,452
or to an individual player's performance level.       

257
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:07,091
they wind polypropylene tape around the carbon layers    

258
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,527
to squeeze out the air between them.         

259
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,035
they bake the carbon in an oven
for two hours.         

260
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,171
this cures the resin impregnated in the carbon   

261
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,507
so the many layers become one. 

262
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,981
after they slice away the tape,

263
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,918
they slide braided weaves of carbon and fiberglass    

264
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,987
over the fused carbon form.  

265
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,259
they secure the braided tubing with tape.           

266
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,861
they pull a layer of thick carbon over that,   

267
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:49,400
followed by a superstrong synthetic weave called aramid. 

268
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,934
one last taping,        

269
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,805
and this softball bat is ready to take shape.    

270
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,443
they place the carbon-wrapped forms in a mold.        

271
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:05,616
as the mold closes around them,
they prepare an epoxy resin.  

272
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,824
they then inject the resin into the mold.         

273
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:18,029
it permeates the many layers wrapped around the steel form. 

274
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,298
the mold applies hot pressure to bake the layers together  

275
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,601
and define the contours of these bats.         

276
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,572
it takes just a few minutes in the mold          

277
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,976
to transform the many layers into a solid bat.       

278
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:36,113
this 5-ton puller now extracts the steel form  

279
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,317
on which the carbon bat was built.           

280
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,656
they use this pneumatic equipment      

281
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,091
to test its flexibility.    

282
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,597
a lathe now spins the bat as a cutter moves in      

283
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,801
and carves the hardened resin base into a knob.    

284
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:03,608
the knob on the right     
now meets league specifications.

285
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,277
now this carbon bat goes for another spin     

286
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,614
so they can sand it from every angle.       

287
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,350
they dip the bats two at a time in black primer 

288
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,718
and hang them to dry.     

289
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,691
the bat then takes on a more colorful appearance   

290
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,461
with a variety of spray paints.

291
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,300
they transfer decals with production information  

292
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,102
onto the barrel of the bat,  

293
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,305
and a laser burns the company logo and serial number     

294
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,775
into the painted carbon.    

295
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,976
they cap the bat        

296
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:42,512
by press-fitting a polycarbonate
plug to the barrel.      

297
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,650
resin completes the seal, and they add extra       

298
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,186
to adjust the bat's weight to league specifications.    

299
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,590
they pump the resin in through a hole in the knob,  

300
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,726
and it flows up to the barrel plug.     

301
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,665
then they weigh each bat    

302
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,501
to verify that it's within an acceptable range.      

303
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
using a hydraulic ram,     

304
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,143
they drive a steel pin into the
hole on the bottom of the knob 

305
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:17,348
to achieve the correct balance point.         

306
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,750
and it's time to wrap this carbon bat        

307
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,687
with synthetic leather, making it easier to grip.   

308
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,426
these high-tech bats are now ready         

309
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,295
to team up with raw talent, and they could         

310
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,098
blow the competition out of the ball park.     

311
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,378
if you have any comments about the show
