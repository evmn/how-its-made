1
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,522
            narrator:           
   the origin of facial tissue  
        may be japanese.        

2
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,725
   a 17th-century historical    
   account describes japanese   

3
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,461
       blowing their noses      
     in small, soft papers,     

4
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,663
       then throwing them       
         on the ground.         

5
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:08,200
  modern-day tissues were first 
   marketed in the early 1920s  

6
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,871
      as a disposable cloth     
   for wiping off cold cream.   

7
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,210
while some sneezers still prefer
traditional cloth handkerchiefs,

8
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,080
   the disposable paper tissue  
   is the implement of choice   

9
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,350
       with the sniffling       
    and lens-cleaning masses.   

10
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:27,486
       this brand is made       
  entirely of recycled paper -- 

11
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,189
          specifically,         
   used computer-printer paper  

12
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:34,960
   because its short, flexible  
   fibers produce soft tissue.  

13
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,697
 the ½-ton bales go into a giant
   machine called the pulper.   

14
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,033
          it breaks up          
      the paper into fibers     

15
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,835
   and mixes them with water.   

16
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,570
   the result is called pulp.   

17
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,972
    next, it injects the pulp   
            with air.           

18
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,842
       this causes the ink      
    to detach from the fibers   

19
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,777
  and cling to the air bubbles, 

20
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,113
      which rise to the top     
         and drain off.         

21
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,782
     the machine then feeds     
     the now-ink-free pulp      

22
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,317
    through several rollers.    

23
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,519
      like an old-fashioned     
     ringer washing machine,    

24
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,656
     the rollers squeeze out    
        the dirty water.        

25
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,924
        a screw conveyor        
     then breaks up the pulp    

26
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,860
          and moves it          
      to the next station,      

27
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,329
         which rinses it        
        with clean water.       

28
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,065
      now the pulp is ready     
        to become tissue.       

29
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,468
   that transformation begins   
      in the paper machine.     

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,205
   it injects the pulp evenly   
across the screen conveyor belt.

31
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,541
      then the pulp passes      
         through rollers        

32
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,276
    that press out the water.   

33
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,279
   the extracted water drains   
    down through the screen.    

34
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,949
      the pulp then passes      
     through a hot-air dryer    

35
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:34,553
and exits the machine as a thin,
  10-foot-wide sheet of paper.  

36
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,822
         each jumbo roll        
     coming off the machine     

37
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,292
            contains            
    about 37 miles of paper.    

38
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,032
     the converting machine     
    is the giant contraption    

39
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:49,635
       that now transforms      
    this paper into tissues.    

40
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,638
    the first station unwinds   
       two rolls of paper,      

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,108
     applying modest tension    
  to remove waves and wrinkles. 

42
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,644
     the next station mates     
         the two papers,        

43
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,847
   producing a two-ply sheet.   

44
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,052
   the following station holds  
 the sheets steady with suction 

45
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,988
   as a knife slices across it  
        every 8½ inches.        

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,526
      you can see the cuts      
         in slow motion.        

47
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,395
      at the next station,      
  these two-ply sheets meet up  

48
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,465
   with two-ply sheets coming   
  from the opposite direction.  

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,136
   here's what that looks like  
       in slow motion....       

50
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,340
       and at full speed.       

51
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,610
  the sheets enter a mechanism  
     that folds them in half    

52
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,411
   in an interlocking fashion.  

53
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,482
   in slow motion, you can see  
      how they interlock --     

54
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:39,018
   each sheet folded in half,   

55
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,755
        one side inserted       
into the fold of the next sheet.

56
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:51,630
     this happens at a speed    
     of 16 folds per second.    

57
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:56,802
   this produces a huge stack   
  of folded tissue 5 feet wide. 

58
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,110
   the next station separates   
  the big stack into small ones 

59
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,780
         in preparation         
     for the final cutting.     

60
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,515
   each smaller stack contains  

61
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:12,985
  the precise number of tissues 
  the tissue box will contain,  

62
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:18,691
from 80 to 250 sheets, depending
on the format they're packaging.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,401
  the smaller stacks now travel 
      to the next station,      

64
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,537
 where an automated circular saw
      cuts every 8 inches,      

65
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,707
producing the final tissue size.

66
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,216
  the interlocking folds ensure 

67
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,352
     that when you pull out     
           one tissue,          

68
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:50,021
        it draws the next       
  out of the box, ready to use. 

69
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,957
  to produce three-ply tissues, 

70
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,359
     the converting machine     
       processes six rolls      

71
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,495
         into two sheets        
      of three plies each,      

72
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,265
   then folds them in the same  
      interlocking fashion.     

73
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,106
   the finished tissues travel  
        by conveyor belt        

74
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,842
to the automated packaging line.

75
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,251
      a robot with multiple     
       suction-cupped arms      

76
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:23,322
      grabs flattened boxes     
   one at a time, opens them,   

77
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,257
        and lines them up       
    on another conveyor belt    

78
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,393
        running alongside       
        the tissue belt.        

79
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,730
        an automated arm        
     compresses the tissues     

80
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,867
  and slides them into the box. 

81
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,870
     the next station glues     
        the flaps closed.       

82
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,806
       the top of the box       
       has a removable tab      

83
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,476
     with clear plastic film    
           underneath.          

84
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,011
    a tight slot in the film    

85
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:50,216
 makes grabbing a single tissue 
           a nonissue.          

86
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,232
            narrator:           
    hitching a travel trailer   
         to your vehicle        

87
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,435
      is the ideal solution     
  if you yearn to travel freely 

88
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,303
            with all            
    the conveniences of home    

89
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,571
         or love camping        

90
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,307
    but want far more comfort   
    than a tent has to offer.   

91
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,975
 today's trailers come equipped 

92
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:22,548
    with beds, mini kitchen,    
  dinette, toilet, and shower.  

93
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,185
this 16-foot-long travel trailer

94
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,922
       is made of aluminum      
    and composite materials.    

95
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,324
       unlike traditional       
      fiberglass trailers,      

96
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,926
    there's no steel or wood    
        in the structure,       

97
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,997
        so it's resistant       
   to both rock and corrosion.  

98
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,935
 it's ultra lightweight and has 
   a pop-up roof with windows.  

99
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:46,938
 the trailer's a-shaped chassis 
 is made entirely of aluminum.  

100
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,141
    the only steel components   
         are the tongue         

101
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,609
    that attaches the trailer   
     to the vehicle's hitch     

102
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,078
          and the axle.         

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,548
      workers insulate both     
         with duct tape.        

104
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,286
 they bolt the axle, with brakes
   installed, to the chassis,   

105
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,555
      then line the chassis     
   with styrofoam insulation.   

106
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:07,025
this prevents the copper propane
line from touching the aluminum.

107
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,228
 contact between the two metals 
     can trigger corrosion.     

108
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,497
        next, they mount        

109
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,700
the trailer's plastic freshwater
     and waste-water tanks,     

110
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,569
  then glue the aluminum floor  
         to the chassis.        

111
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,238
     other workers construct    
  the trailer's two side walls  

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,773
       as a single piece.       

113
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,375
    on a large vacuum press,    

114
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,045
        they spread glue        
     onto an aluminum sheet.    

115
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,580
       then they lay down       
        the wall's core,        

116
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,117
    a honeycomb-shaped sheet    
        of polypropylene.       

117
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,392
     they coat it with glue,    

118
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,127
           then top it          
 with another sheet of aluminum.

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,867
    the honeycomb core makes    
         the wall rigid         

120
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,736
  while adding minimal weight.  

121
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,540
    they cover this sandwich    
 with a protective fabric sheet,

122
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,275
  then with an airtight cover.  

123
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,011
  after sealing the perimeter,  

124
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:02,747
     they vacuum out the air    
      for about four hours.     

125
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,884
  this pulls everything tight,  
  compressing the glued layers  

126
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,954
    so that they fully adhere   
         to each other.         

127
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,294
       when the wall comes      
        out of the press,       

128
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,895
     they lay down templates    

129
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:21,233
       and, with a router,      
   cut it into two side walls.  

130
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,669
     they also make openings    
         for windows...         

131
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,978
...and holes for trailer lights.

132
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,986
  after inserting a rubber seal 
          in each hole,         

133
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,122
    they install the lights.    

134
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,060
     next, a porthole-style     
      tinted upper window.      

135
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,595
          they glue it          
     into the round opening     

136
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,398
   just like a car windshield.  

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,467
  the side walls are now ready. 

138
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,669
 workers affix them to the floor

139
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,039
        with an l-shaped        
        aluminum bracket.       

140
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,151
     once the walls are up,     
 workers saw out a door opening,

141
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:16,088
     then install the door,     
sliding windows, toilet cabinet,

142
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,424
  king-size bed, dining table,  
        and kitchen unit,       

143
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:24,295
            which has           
    a sink and propane stove.   

144
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,298
          they install          
    a rubber-sealed trapdoor    

145
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,166
  into an opening in one wall.  

146
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,036
    this gives outside access   
        to a storage area       

147
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,706
         about the size         
      of a large suitcase.      

148
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,040
    upholstered cushions hide   

149
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,909
         under-the-seat         
      storage compartments      

150
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,312
       in the dining area.      

151
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,381
     they construct the roof    
   the same way as the walls,   

152
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,851
    only in a teardrop-shaped   
          vacuum press.         

153
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:50,122
 this aerodynamic shape creates 
          75% less drag         

154
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,991
  than a traditional box-shaped 
          trailer roof.         

155
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,793
   when the trailer is parked,  

156
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:58,597
you can raise the roof to reveal
  fixed windows on both sides.  

157
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,732
          workers glue          
   this tinted, tempered glass  

158
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:04,669
 to each aluminum window frame, 
  glue the frames to the roof,  

159
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,607
    then install taillights,    
  roof vents, and solar panels  

160
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,608
to recharge the battery powering

161
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,877
           the lights,          
      vent, and water pump.     

162
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,683
     they install the roof,     
 then mount a hinged back wall. 

163
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,419
 with assembly finally complete,

164
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:25,023
  workers apply decals and test 
   all appliances and systems.  

165
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:31,163
     cables connect the roof    
        to the back wall,       

166
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,497
     so when the roof lifts,    

167
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,700
           it pulls up          
  the otherwise-collapsed wall. 

168
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,908
  the trailer's interior layout 
          is versatile.         

169
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,577
   the king-size bed converts   
       into two twin beds,      

170
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,579
      and the dining table      
          can be moved          

171
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,248
            to create           
   two distinct dining areas,   

172
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,719
           a two-seat           
   and a five-seat dinette --   

173
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:58,223
 all the comforts and amenities 
       of home on wheels.       

174
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,075
    narrator: there's nothing   
     like a pair of slippers    

175
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:21,012
  to soothe your tired tootsies 
    or warm your frigid feet.   

176
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,281
        designed strictly       
         for indoor use,        

177
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,484
     slippers typically have    
   a soft sole and looser fit   

178
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,354
     and are made of supple,    
      often cushy materials     

179
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,390
        so that feet feel       
      comfortable and cozy.     

180
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,697
      this style of slipper     
    is known as charentaise,    

181
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,100
    named after the region of   
 charente in southwestern france

182
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,770
      where they originated     
      in the 17th century.      

183
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,039
      the slippers are made     
       primarily of felt,       

184
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,977
   which is made from layers    
   of compressed wool fibers.   

185
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,645
this french slipper factory uses

186
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,248
a particularly thick and durable
          type of felt          

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,052
            composed            
   of five wool-fiber layers.   

188
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,653
        to cut the soles,       

189
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,122
        workers position        
    a cookie-cutter-type die    

190
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,591
   for the specific shoe size   
         in production.         

191
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:11,596
  then a 5-ton press forces it  
     through the thick felt.    

192
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,732
          after cutting         
      one sole of the pair,     

193
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,200
        they turn the die       
    in the opposite direction   

194
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,502
     to cut the second sole.    

195
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,941
 once the batch of soles is cut,

196
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,212
    they mark the size in ink   
      with a rubber stamp.      

197
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,421
  for the rest of the slipper,  
        called the upper,       

198
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,690
         they use fabric        
   that's felt on the outside,  

199
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,292
      velvet on the inside.     

200
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,696
       the cutting process      
  is the same as for the sole,  

201
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,400
   with the die corresponding   
   to the size in production.   

202
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,510
    once the uppers are cut,    

203
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,314
  workers lay a stencil of the  
 embroidery pattern on each one 

204
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,816
        and lightly mark        
      the design in pencil.     

205
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,392
     seamstresses embroider     
    each slipper individually   

206
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,394
          by a machine.         

207
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:18,463
    the yarn is made of hemp.   

208
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:23,735
   for this model, the design   
  is applied in a chain stitch. 

209
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:36,982
  felt flowers give the design  
  three-dimensional features.   

210
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,221
    with the design complete,   

211
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,391
       it's time to stitch      
  the back of the upper closed. 

212
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,764
 next, they cushion the opening 
 at the top with velvet binding,

213
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,967
 bending the wide velvet ribbon 
    over the edge of the felt   

214
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,836
 so that the binding runs along 

215
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,173
   both the inside and outside  
         of the slipper.        

216
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,055
    they cover the back seam    
        with a backstrap,       

217
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,924
          a felt strip          
     with a loop at the top     

218
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,793
      through which you can     
         put your finger        

219
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:25,097
   to easily pull the slipper   
         onto your foot.        

220
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,135
         next, they turn        
the back of the upper inside out

221
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,671
  in order to attach the sole.  

222
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,342
   they position the sole 3/10  
of an inch from the bottom edge,

223
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,676
     then, with hemp thread,    

224
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,947
straight-stitch along the entire
     perimeter of the upper.    

225
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,493
  they cut the slipper's insole 
          from a fabric         

226
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:58,896
    that's felt on one side     
    and velvet on the other.    

227
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,500
   they position the felt side  
     against the felt sole,     

228
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,701
     then sew them together     
       along the perimeter      

229
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,770
        with a particular       
       cross-shaped stitch      

230
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:09,241
       traditionally used       
      for the charentaise.      

231
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,842
   the inside felt's underside  

232
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,111
        gives the slipper       
      additional rigidity,      

233
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,446
  while the soft velvet surface 

234
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,215
            cushions            
    the bottom of your foot.    

235
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,322
           the slipper          
    is now fully constructed.   

236
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,257
    however, it's inside out.   

237
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,261
     so the next step is to     
 turn the slipper right side out

238
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,596
  using this piece of equipment 
         called a goat,         

239
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:37,268
    perhaps because its shape   
      resembles goat horns.     

240
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,338
      all that manipulation     
       can slightly deform      

241
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,873
      and crease the upper,     

242
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
     so they put the slipper    
         in a steam box         

243
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,811
        for three minutes       
      to soften the fibers,     

244
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,280
      then on a foot-shaped     
         aluminum press         

245
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,950
             heated             
   to 158 degrees fahrenheit.   

246
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,086
       the press irons out      
     any remaining wrinkles     

247
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,622
      and resets the shape.     

248
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,225
         this factory's         
   charentaise-style slippers   

249
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,360
     range from conservative    
            to funky.           

250
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,896
        all are designed        
    to be comfortable, cozy,    

251
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:10,001
   and as the term "slippers"   
implies, easy to slip on or off.

252
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,586
    narrator: the development   
    of the motorcycle helmet    

253
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,986
      happened by accident.     

254
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,591
  in 1935, the british war hero 
   known as lawrence of arabia  

255
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,528
     died from a head injury    
     in a motorcycle crash.     

256
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,063
   he wasn't wearing a helmet.  

257
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,331
       that tragedy moved       
       one of his doctors       

258
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,336
to research the safety potential
     of motorcycle helmets.     

259
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,275
      the motorcycle helmet     
   is the most important part   

260
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,210
      of the motorcyclist's     
          safety gear.          

261
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,279
       today, wearing one       
      is a rule of the road     

262
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,749
in many places around the world.

263
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,217
         modern helmets         
     are entirely synthetic.    

264
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,756
 they design them on a computer.

265
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,958
       the software guides      
          milling tools         

266
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,627
     to produce a prototype     
     from polyurethane foam.    

267
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,896
    the prototype gives them    
           a good look          

268
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,632
at the helmet's shape and style.

269
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,101
 once they're satisfied with it,

270
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,672
     they build a metal mold    
      for mass production.      

271
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:27,245
     the molding material is    
a pile of polycarbonate pellets.

272
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:31,583
it's the same thing used to make
    astronaut bubble helmets.   

273
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,452
  an injection molding machine  
        melts the pellets       

274
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:39,724
        and injects them        
 into the two-part helmet mold. 

275
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,192
     the polycarbonate cools    

276
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,928
         and solidifies         
   into the shape of the mold.  

277
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,264
          the result is         
 the outer shell of the helmet, 

278
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:50,402
       complete with holes      
   for vents and other parts.   

279
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,940
       next, a robot grips      
       the helmet's shell       

280
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,942
          and moves it          
     against a sanding belt     

281
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,145
       to smooth the seam       
       left by the mold.        

282
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,549
 the robot also gives the shell 
       an overall polish.       

283
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,351
     it then goes for a spin    

284
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,119
       as sprayers coat it      
        with black paint.       

285
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,761
    a factory employee pulls    
 a sheet of decals through water

286
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:21,633
 to lift them from the backing. 

287
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:26,237
     she applies the decals     
  to a white, unpainted helmet. 

288
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:30,775
      it's a flashier look      
        than basic black.       

289
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,845
  it takes practice to be able  
  to apply the decals correctly 

290
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:38,716
   because the helmet surface   
      is complex and curvy.     

291
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,118
  she smoothes out air bubbles  
         in preparation         

292
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,389
       for the application      
   of a protective clear coat.  

293
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,592
   the next assembler installs  
        a pivot mechanism       

294
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,662
   on each side of the helmet.  

295
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,865
         they'll enable         
    the face shield and visor   

296
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,535
    to be raised and lowered.   

297
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,738
   the hardware fits perfectly  
     into the molded niches.    

298
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,273
    there's just enough room    

299
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,310
        for the mechanism       
      to operate smoothly.      

300
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,917
          she attaches          
   the velour-lined chin strap  

301
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,655
with its quick-release mechanism
       to the outer shell.      

302
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,230
   then these foam polystyrene  
     pellets are transformed    

303
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,700
        into the helmet's       
     cushioning inner shell.    

304
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:34,572
  the pellets flow into another 
    injection molding system.   

305
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,176
   a nozzle injects the melted  
   polystyrene into the mold,   

306
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:44,516
    and it takes the shape of   
 shock-absorbing helmet liners. 

307
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,917
      the foam solidifies,      

308
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,788
     and the machine ejects     
     the completed liners.      

309
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,256
           the density          
 of the polystyrene foam varies 

310
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,259
      throughout the helmet     
 for strategic shock resistance,

311
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,394
       enabling it to meet      

312
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,931
          international         
      safety requirements.      

313
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,134
      padding in the crown      
    and around the chin area    

314
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,303
            makes it            
    more comfortable to wear.   

315
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,742
   they now join the helmet's   
  inner shell to the outer one. 

316
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:14,679
   after a liberal application  
            of glue,            

317
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,614
      she pushes the liner      
         into the shell.        

318
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,882
        it's a snug fit,        

319
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,352
      and it takes a bit of     
 maneuvering to get it in there.

320
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,958
she attaches a robust chin guard
         to the helmet.         

321
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,027
 this molded polycarbonate part 
           is designed          

322
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:34,965
    to protect the lower half   
      of the rider's face.      

323
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,235
     the assembler screws it    
  to the helmet on both sides.  

324
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,510
    with this part in place,    

325
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:50,615
the rider should be able to take
  it on the chin if necessary.  

326
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,853
          a transparent         
    polycarbonate face shield   

327
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,690
            completes           
     this motorcycle helmet.    

328
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,327
         and now a test.        

329
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,728
       they drop a helmet       
    from a height of 10 feet    

330
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,398
  to confirm it can take a fall 
     without falling apart.     

331
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,539
   it survives, and the entire  
  production batch is approved. 

332
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,609
       designed for impact      
   and made to specification,   

333
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:21,446
        this helmet could       
      just save your skull.
