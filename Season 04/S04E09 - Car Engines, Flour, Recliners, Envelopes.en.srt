00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,157
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,028
...car engines...       

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,465
...flour...

00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,471
...recliners...        

7
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,044
...and envelopes.       

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,454
car engines work by internal combustion,    

9
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,857
a process that happens in each of the engine's cylinders.   

10
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,794
air and a drop of gasoline enter the cylinder.      

11
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,930
the piston moves upward, compressing the mixture.    

12
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,998
the spark plug ignites the gasoline      

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,402
causing an explosion      
that drives the piston downward,

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,337
powering the engine.      

15
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,210
engine components are housed in
what's called the engine block.

16
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,412
it arrives at this plant partially made.        

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,016
here, they finish it off by machining the cylinder bores, 

18
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,353
the holes in which the pistons move up and down. 

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,756
the tool carves a crisscross pattern  

20
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,557
on the cylinder bore walls.  

21
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,627
lubricating oil will cling to the grooves in this pattern 

22
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,830
enabling the pistons to move smoothly.       

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,767
after machining,        

24
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,835
the engine block travels upside down      

25
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,105
to the engine assembly line.  

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,773
when it arrives there,     

27
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,843
a scanner records the block's traceability code, 

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,846
a barcode that enables the factory    

29
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:58,650
to track the block through every stage of production.   

30
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,520
as the engine block travels down the line,     

31
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,054
error-proofing devices     

32
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,158
ensure that each component is installed properly.     

33
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,196
elsewhere in the factory,   

34
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,265
the crankshaft is slowly taking shape.    

35
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,668
the crankshaft is a bar that's rotated         

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,204
by the up-and-down motion of the pistons.        

37
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:24,008
as it turns, it transfers power
to the transmission.      

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,946
the crankshaft starts out as a roughly shaped steel forging.

39
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,548
robotic arms pass it down the line     

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,419
from station to station until, 20 tooling machines later,   

41
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,155
it's fully formed.       

42
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,311
now they install a steel disc with teeth    

43
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,246
called the reluctor ring.   

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,650
they heat it and press it onto the crankshaft.      

45
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,919
as it cools, it shrinks to a tight fit.   

46
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,589
this ring helps time the combustion cycle.     

47
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,990
as it spins,          

48
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,526
its teeth pass in front of a sensor,   

49
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,528
which reads the crankshaft's position   

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,397
and tells the engine to fire the spark plugs    

51
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,200
at precisely the right moment. 

52
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,738
now they balance the crankshaft.         

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,875
if it's off-kilter, the engine will vibrate.    

54
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,010
a computer analyzes the spin  

55
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,479
and determines whether they need to drill out metal  

56
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,749
at certain points to achieve equilibrium.    

57
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,951
back on the engine assembly line,         

58
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,355
the engine blocks are still upside down.     

59
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,690
a robot lubricates the four bearings        

60
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,159
on which the crankshaft will turn,           

61
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,930
then it drops the crankshaft into position.         

62
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,238
the pistons come next --    

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,576
six per engine because these are six-cylinder engines.   

64
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,715
the pistons are made of aluminum.          

65
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,452
robots install them into the cylinder bores    

66
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,053
of the engine block.      

67
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:19,024
a steel connecting rod attaches
each piston to the crankshaft. 

68
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,262
now workers can close up the back of the engine block. 

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,999
a robot applies sealant to the rear cover.       

70
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,002
they bolt it on manually    

71
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,772
with a tool called a multi-spindle torque gun.  

72
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,142
on another line,        

73
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,877
they assemble the two heads  

74
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,546
that'll cover the top of the engine block.      

75
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,549
this robot is applying sealant to spark plug tubes      

76
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,885
before inserting them into the heads.        

77
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,163
the heads cap off the cylinder bores.      

78
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,100
they provide each cylinder with
a spark plug and four valves --

79
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,369
two for allowing the fuel mixture in      

80
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,439
and two for releasing the exhaust.          

81
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,910
the black tubes running front to back are the cam shafts,  

82
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,046
the components that open and close those valves.     

83
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,182
there are four per engine.   

84
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,583
a robot applies sealant    

85
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,386
and then bolts a cover onto the front of the engine block, 

86
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,856
the head, and a component called the timing chain.    

87
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,926
this chain connects the crankshaft to the cam shafts  

88
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,328
so that they rotate in unison. 

89
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,996
this ensures the valves open  

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,266
when the pistons are in the right position.   

91
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,202
finally, they spin the engine mechanically          

92
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,340
to make sure the components function properly.       

93
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,551
narrator: the grain most commonly ground into flour is wheat.  

94
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:56,220
flour mills use high-protein or hard-wheat species     

95
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,289
to make bread flour      

96
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,692
and lower-protein or soft-wheat species     

97
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,628
to produce cake and pastry flour.       

98
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,599
all-purpose flour is a compromise with medium protein.

99
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,372
as soon as the wheat shipment arrives,            

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,210
a grain probe vacuums up samples
from throughout the load.   

101
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,716
if the samples pass quality inspection,    

102
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,784
the mill gives the truck the go-ahead          

103
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,122
to dump the wheat onto an underground conveyor. 

104
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,924
from there, the grain goes into a cleaning machine, 

105
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,993
where a system of sieves removes impurities       

106
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,730
such as straw, sticks, and grain dust.    

107
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,802
the wheat then goes into storage
silos until milling time.   

108
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,005
the protein content of wheat varies by species,       

109
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,539
so the first step       

110
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,875
is to blend together the right varieties of wheat  

111
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,011
for the type of flour they'll be making.       

112
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,348
from the blender,       

113
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,785
the wheat goes through a second,
more intensive cleaning system 

114
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,888
that removes the tiniest of impurities,         

115
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,491
such as weed seeds and dust.  

116
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,359
on the way to the milling machines,    

117
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,095
a scale tracks production quantities. 

118
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,833
this mill's vertical-production
line is five stories high.   

119
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,369
gravity carries the wheat downward   

120
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,639
through a succession of milling machines.      

121
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,642
each one grinds the grain between steel rollers     

122
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,176
and then sifts it.       

123
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,979
particles too large to pass through a sieve    

124
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,716
continue downward into the next
milling machine and so on.   

125
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,185
by the time the wheat hits the last machine,     

126
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,121
anything that's not fully processed   

127
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:40,192
gets vacuumed up to the top to begin the cycle again.   

128
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,793
mills make white flour     

129
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,529
by grinding only the wheat kernel's soft inner part,

130
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,398
called the endosperm.     

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,868
this requires removing the bran,
the kernel's hard skin,    

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,204
and the germ, its seed.    

133
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,475
that separation begins as soon as the wheat kernels  

134
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,344
enter the very first milling machine.        

135
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,147
rollers break off the germ and bran       

136
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,083
and crush the endosperm into pieces called semolina.  

137
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,021
sifting removes the germ and loose bran pieces,     

138
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,024
but much of the semolina remains
covered in bran particles.   

139
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,828
so between each milling station
is a purifier,         

140
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,230
a machine that uses controlled air currents    

141
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,367
to float the lighter bran above the heavier semolina,  

142
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,637
enabling sieves to separate the two components.      

143
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,242
the semolina goes through repeated grind, sift,     

144
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:34,379
and purify cycles until it's completely clean.  

145
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:38,916
only then can it be finely ground into flour.   

146
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,453
the ground semolina passes through a series of sieves.  

147
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,323
this ensures it doesn't leave the final milling machine   

148
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,226
until it's been ground to the right powdery texture. 

149
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,333
there are three main types of white-wheat flour.     

150
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,535
bread flour has high protein, 

151
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,740
enabling dough to rise well and bake to a firm texture.  

152
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,408
cake flour has low protein,  

153
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,543
which produces a crumbly texture.       

154
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,613
all-purpose flour is the compromise --      

155
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,415
its medium-protein content   

156
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,685
makes it suitable for baking both bread and cakes.     

157
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,287
by the end of production,   

158
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,624
the flour mill has produced three distinct products --   

159
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,861
bran, used for animal feed and baking...         

160
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,932
...white-wheat flour...    

161
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,236
and wheat germ for the health-food market.  

162
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,840
leftover by-products go into livestock feed.    

163
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,510
in the mill's quality-control lab,      

164
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,245
they bake the product for which the flour is designed

165
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,649
and then examine its appearance,
texture, and taste.      

166
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,789
they use specialized equipment to calculate the volume,    

167
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,625
the density, protein, and moisture contents.     

168
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:00,665
with baked goods destined for 
retail sale, like these cookies,

169
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,601
it's especially important to measure the dimensions.   

170
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,336
if dough overexpands,     

171
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,739
the cookies won't fit in their package.  

172
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,207
just prior to packaging,    

173
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,077
the mill enriches its white flour        

174
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,145
with vitamins and minerals.  

175
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,748
this replaces the vitamins and minerals lost       

176
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,219
when the milling process removed the bran and germ.   

177
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,955
they shake the bags to settle the flour.      

178
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:28,360
bagged flour in various sizes goes out to supermarkets,   

179
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,695
restaurants, and commercial bakeries,    

180
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,697
while tanker trunks ship bulk flour        

181
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,100
to large industrial bakeries. 

182
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,110
narrator: the first reclining armchair  

183
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:49,247
was introduced by the la-z-boy company in 1928. 

184
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,316
today, many companies make motion furniture,     

185
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,052
as the industry calls it,   

186
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,789
and the term "recliner" no   
longer refers to just armchairs.

187
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:02,727
you can buy reclining couches and even reclining sectionals. 

188
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,068
this factory makes reclining chairs and couches  

189
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,869
in both fabric and leather.  

190
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,205
the furniture construction is the same,          

191
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,874
regardless of the material,  

192
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:20,277
but leather upholstery requires a few extra steps.  

193
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,414
they begin by inspecting the hide,    

194
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,617
marking serious defects with one color of tape     

195
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,953
and minor imperfections with another.         

196
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,088
a computer-programmed cutting machine        

197
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,624
scans and registers the tape markings,       

198
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,428
then automatically cuts and discards the defective parts. 

199
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,964
it cuts upholstery pieces for hidden areas,       

200
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,367
such as the undersides of seat cushions,       

201
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,701
from the imperfect leather   

202
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,404
and visible parts from flawless leather.     

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,042
once all the pieces are cut,  

204
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,512
they sew together the back, seat, and arms.        

205
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,049
then, they stuff the arms and back.       

206
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,185
they position the open end against a blowing machine    

207
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,354
that fills it with polyester fiber.     

208
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,060
workers weigh each part before and after filling.   

209
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,529
this ensures they've blown in the right amount of fiber   

210
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,465
and that both arms have equal filling.      

211
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,477
next, they'll fill the seat with foam.           

212
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,880
a compression machine squeezes it,          

213
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,550
then a worker sprays on silicone lubricant.      

214
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,620
this enables the seat cover to slide on easily.      

215
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,757
foam is made of a chemical mixture,     

216
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,426
the formulation of which determines the density --   

217
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,429
the higher the density, the higher the quality.    

218
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,230
elsewhere in the factory,   

219
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,500
they cut the frame components from plywood          

220
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,169
using a computer-guided band saw.           

221
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,777
these long pieces will form the seat frame.   

222
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,113
a 3-seater couch has 3 separate frames,     

223
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,850
enabling each seat to recline individually.    

224
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:10,321
a machine lines one side of each
piece with steel spring clips. 

225
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,060
a worker then dabs the ends in glue and assembles the pieces, 

226
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:19,664
reinforcing them with long, glue-coated staples.

227
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,465
as the staples enter the wood, 

228
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,001
friction-generated heat melts the glue.        

229
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,405
the glue then dries, securing the staples.     

230
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,008
now comes the step known as "springing the seat." 

231
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,612
they hook five thick, steel springs into the spring clips, 

232
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:38,148
then hammer the clips closed to lock the springs in place. 

233
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,419
they connect the springs with a plastic-covered wire so that,

234
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,756
when you sit on the seat,   
all the springs react in unison.

235
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,162
they assemble the frame pieces for the arm,          

236
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,998
using glue and glue-coated staples,    

237
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,901
plus a few screws at strategic points.      

238
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:01,372
they screw the arm to the seat and begin upholstering.    

239
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:05,509
first, a layer of felt to cushion the springs, then wood,

240
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,847
cardboard, and foam to form the
rounded shape of the armrest. 

241
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,383
after lubricating with silicone spray,      

242
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:15,386
they slip on the leather and staple it in place.     

243
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:19,590
they upholster the backrest and sides in the same manner. 

244
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,192
the reclining mechanism    

245
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,128
arrives at the factory with the sides preassembled.  

246
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,664
workers install the connecting pieces,     

247
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,401
then a bushing that reduces the noise the mechanism makes. 

248
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:34,072
finally, they install a spring to control the recline speed.  

249
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,708
they screw the mechanism to the seat frame...      

250
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,679
...then hook up the operating handle and test it out.    

251
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,018
to cover the back of the furniture,       

252
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,288
they attach metal tacking strips
to the leather...       

253
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,494
...then turn the edge under and 
hammer the tacks into the frame,

254
00:14:56,496 --> 00:15:00,865
using a pneumatic hammer.   

255
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,567
the last step is to attach the back to the seat.     

256
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,504
there's the detachable flap at the bottom,         

257
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,173
providing access to a locking spring inside.  

258
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,310
the locking spring lets you remove the back    

259
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,780
if you have trouble getting  
the furniture through a doorway.

260
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,381
at this factory,        

261
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,318
workers are encouraged to lie down on the job,    

262
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,920
but only to inspect the furniture.         

263
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,390
after examining the fabric and sewing,     

264
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,659
they assess the comfort and test the reclining motion. 

265
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,362
talk about a cushy job.    

266
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,272
narrator: we rip it open with barely a thought,     

267
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,141
more anxious to read its contents      

268
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,409
than to take a moment     

269
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,412
to truly appreciate its form and function,     

270
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,547
and then we ruthlessly discard it.   

271
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,684
the humble envelope just doesn't get much respect 

272
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,956
despite its distinguished 4,000-year history.      

273
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,031
as early as 2,000 b.c.,    

274
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,767
the babylonians baked special clay wrappers  

275
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,368
to transport documents.    

276
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,570
eventually,          

277
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,972
people made envelopes from lighter materials,    

278
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,708
such as animal skins and leaves.

279
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,844
by about 1,000 a.d.,      

280
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,179
it became the custom to simply fold a letter    

281
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,448
and seal it with a drop of wax.

282
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,118
but everything changed in 1837 

283
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,920
with england's new penny-postage system.     

284
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,322
to mail a letter,       

285
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,792
the sender now had to buy a postage-paid paper wrapper  

286
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,563
that folded into an envelope. 

287
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,406
one of the many envelope styles
this factory makes       

288
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:55,279
is a 12-by-18-inch envelope made
of natural-colored kraft paper. 

289
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,681
a machine, appropriately called
the sheeter,          

290
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:02,220
cuts the roll into 21-by-25-inch sheets.   

291
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,623
a worker selects the cutting die
for this style         

292
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,358
and installs it on an automated press.     

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,496
as each stack of sheets passes underneath,       

294
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,965
the press applies 11 tons of pressure,      

295
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:19,804
forcing the die right through like a giant cookie cutter.  

296
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,542
the shaped sheets are called "envelope blanks." 

297
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,249
workers now load the blanks  

298
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,718
into the feeder of an automated
piece of equipment       

299
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,256
called a blank-sheet envelope-folding machine.   

300
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,324
as we see here in slow motion, 

301
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:44,829
revolving steel blades first make scorelines, four in all --

302
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:49,166
one down each side, creating the envelope's side flaps,   

303
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,336
one across the top, creating the seal flap,    

304
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:56,274
and one across the lower end, creating the bottom flap.   

305
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,683
folding blades hold the paper down along the scorelines,   

306
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,285
while arms push up from underneath,        

307
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,622
folding the side flaps toward the center.       

308
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,424
just before the flaps meet,  

309
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,961
the machine runs a line of glue
down their edge.        

310
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,830
the flaps adhere to each other,
forming the center seam    

311
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,866
that runs down the back of the envelope.        

312
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,906
the machine then glues the   
bottom flap and folds it closed.

313
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,241
you can see in slow motion   

314
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,910
how it also applies glue to the seal flap at the top,  

315
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:37,248
keeping that flap open so that the glue will dry.   

316
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,685
the sender has to just remoisten
the glue to seal the envelope. 

317
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,522
the finished envelope exits the folding machine   

318
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,059
and enters another machine that counts them        

319
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,961
and stacks them upright.    

320
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,473
this more sophisticated piece of equipment       

321
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,477
is called a web-roll envelope-folding machine.   

322
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,680
they feed the roll of paper directly into the machine   

323
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,682
and, as we see here in slow motion,        

324
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,550
it does everything       

325
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,755
from cutting, scoring, folding,
and gluing the blanks     

326
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,823
to counting the finished envelopes.    

327
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,425
for this style,        

328
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,561
a die even punches out an address window       

329
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,396
in the front of the envelope. 

330
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,168
this all-in-one machine    

331
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,971
goes through all the steps at lightning speed --     

332
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,973
20 envelopes per second.    

333
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,518
the thin, transparent film that covers the address window 

334
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,187
is usually made of polypropylene.       

335
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,858
the machine cuts it to size and glues it to the envelope. 

336
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,861
this machine doesn't have folding blades  

337
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,865
to hold the paper down along the scorelines.      

338
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,001
instead, the blanks roll through
a series of rotating cylinders 

339
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,469
with air holes.        

340
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,473
a suction system vacuums the blank to the cylinder   

341
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,875
while the operation is being performed,      

342
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,277
then releases the vacuum    

343
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,879
to transfer the paper to the next cylinder,     

344
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,617
where it's vacuumed on for the duration of the next operation.

345
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,958
internal-mail envelopes are opened and closed repeatedly, 

346
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,895
so they don't have a lick-and-stick seal flap    

347
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,863
like regular envelopes do.   

348
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:35,633
as we see here in slow motion, 

349
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,369
an automated machine rivets a cardboard button   

350
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,971
to the back of the envelope.  

351
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,839
at the same time,       

352
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,177
it rivets another button, with a piece of string, to the flap.

353
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,588
envelope factories use many different types of paper, 

354
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,726
from top-quality vellum to kraft paper.        

355
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,461
with printing equipment    

356
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,796
incorporated          
right into the folding machines,

357
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:10,067
they can print return addresses,
even elaborate custom designs.
