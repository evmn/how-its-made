00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:25,290
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,960
engine blocks...        

5
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,099
...jawbreakers...       

6
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,772
...drum shells...       

7
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,144
...and drums.         

8
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:56,187
the engine block is the largest
single piece of metal in a car 

9
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,722
and also one of the most intricate.           

10
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,191
it houses and links all the engine components,   

11
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,127
such as the cylinders and pistons,          

12
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,729
and it contains passages for circulating coolant.    

13
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,032
the engine block is where combustion converts  

14
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,734
into mechanical energy that drives the transmission, 

15
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,470
propelling the car.      

16
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,877
engine blocks used to be made of iron.            

17
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,546
today, most are made of lightweight aluminum alloy 

18
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,215
for fuel efficiency.      

19
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,217
an engine block is a one-piece component    

20
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,886
cast from a sand mold.     

21
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:32,624
to make the mold, the factory mixes glue...   

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,027
and a hardener...       

23
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,229
with zircon sand.       

24
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,630
this combination of materials 

25
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,099
can withstand the intense heat of molten metal,        

26
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,168
but only for one casting.   

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,707
each mold is made up of sections called cores    

28
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,976
that fit together.       

29
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,043
to make each core,       

30
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,512
a machine blows the sand-and-glue mixture   

31
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:57,115
into a master mold made of iron.

32
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,718
it injects a gas that activates the hardener,  

33
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,254
which solidifies the mixture. 

34
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,627
this is the base core to which other cores will attach.    

35
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,604
the base core travels down an assembly line        

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,740
to receive the other cores.  

37
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,416
the next core molds      
the engine-block cylinder bores,

38
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,052
which will house the motor's pistons.      

39
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,490
a robot inserts iron liners into six holes in the core.  

40
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,693
they prevent the aluminum walls
of the bores          

41
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,829
from wearing out from abrasion.

42
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,900
the base core receives 17 other cores.        

43
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,070
the ones for engine-block areas
through which oil will flow  

44
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,705
are coated with talcum powder. 

45
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,641
this keeps sand particles from sticking to the aluminum 

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,410
and getting into the oil.   

47
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,783
the machines glue certain cores

48
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,121
so they'll stay intact when  
the robots flip them upside down

49
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,156
and attach them to the rest.  

50
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,795
these are the last two cores. 

51
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,899
the mold is now fully assembled
and ready for casting.     

52
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,044
workers load aluminum ingots  

53
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,480
into a device called an elevator bucket.      

54
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,416
it positions them above the jet melter --       

55
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,418
a gas-fired furnace.      

56
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,628
the bucket drops the ingots  

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,230
into the fire         
that's 1,500 degrees fahrenheit,

58
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,166
liquefying the aluminum.    

59
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,043
just before casting,      

60
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,778
they heat the cylinder-bore liners    

61
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,714
using high-frequency electric current.       

62
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,783
aluminum will bond better to hot metal.         

63
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,454
they fill the molds from the bottom        

64
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,992
to avoid contaminating the metal
with aluminum oxide.      

65
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,995
oxide forms when molten aluminum
comes into contact with the air.

66
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,596
pouring into the top of the mold

67
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,399
would expose the metal to oxygen,           

68
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,403
and the pouring action itself would mix in the oxide.    

69
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,078
after the casting,       

70
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,146
the mold spends six hours in what's called        

71
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,015
a thermal sand reclaim oven.  

72
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,486
that breaks down the glue so the sand falls away.    

73
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,821
the heat also strengthens the metal.           

74
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,091
the cast aluminum engine blocks emerge,     

75
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,093
needing just some minor finishing.     

76
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,831
robots turn them upside down to spill out loose sand.    

77
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,276
machines saw off the risers -- 

78
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,245
extra metal that fed the mold cavity        

79
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,780
to compensate for the 7% shrinkage that occurs    

80
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,783
when liquid aluminum solidifies.

81
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,121
finally, computer-guided tooling equipment       

82
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,657
performs a rough machining of the metal.         

83
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,327
this brings the engine blocks to a near-finished state.   

84
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,929
the engine plant that buys them

85
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:35,200
does the final machining before
installing the engine parts.  

86
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,402
every engine block this factory produces     

87
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,604
passes through an automated vision system   

88
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,473
that inspects the engine block 

89
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,443
to ensure they have no defects whatsoever.     

90
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,893
narrator: jawbreakers, also known as gobstoppers,   

91
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,963
have preoccupied candy lovers for decades.          

92
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,364
you pop one in         

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,033
and slowly suck or chew through up to 10 layers

94
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,102
of colors and flavors.     

95
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,305
sometimes there's bubble gum in the middle         

96
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,941
for an even longer-lasting finish.            

97
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,649
the larger ones are just for show.       

98
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,587
most jawbreakers are about the size of a golf ball.    

99
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,122
to make their bubble gum centers,   

100
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,991
a worker blends synthetic rubber
with powdered resin,      

101
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,893
which will dissolve the rubber.

102
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,000
he adds a thickener, a preservative,        

103
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,603
and an oil called soya palm stearin       

104
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,805
so the candy won't stick to your teeth.   

105
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,877
after mixing and steaming at 300 degrees fahrenheit   

106
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,146
for four hours,        

107
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,215
the batter pours into trays to cool.            

108
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,752
sugar, coloring, and flavoring would deteriorate in the heat, 

109
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,154
so workers add those later.  

110
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,690
there's enough of this base to make gum centers      

111
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,227
for 450,000 small jawbreakers. 

112
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:14,632
after 24 hours, the batter is hard.      

113
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,236
workers chop it up and blend it with corn syrup  

114
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,872
to make it softer and sweeter. 

115
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,251
they add just under 100 pounds of finished gum        

116
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,587
that didn't make it into jawbreakers before    

117
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,422
because it wasn't the right shape.        

118
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,195
now they add natural and artificial flavors,    

119
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,599
which can include lemon, orange,
strawberry, grape,       

120
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,367
even tutti-frutti.       

121
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,473
then they add icing sugar.   

122
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,076
it makes the gum smoother to chew than regular sugar would. 

123
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,278
workers dump the batch into an extruder        

124
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:04,015
that shapes two continuous streams of batter, called rope.

125
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,954
another extruder divides    
each rope into six hollow tubes.

126
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,390
the cavity inside will become pockets of air   

127
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,092
inside the gum centers.    

128
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,428
the next machine slices the tubes           

129
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,798
into segments that are three feet, three inches long. 

130
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,375
a mechanical arm pushes the segments          

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,510
into the channel of a forming machine.     

132
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,846
steel rolls then slice through the tubes  

133
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,048
and shape them into balls.   

134
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,583
the balls range in diameter,  

135
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,887
depending on the size of the jawbreakers being produced.

136
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,532
air blows through perforations in a cooling tunnel      

137
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,269
to cool and firm the centers. 

138
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,472
then they fall into another forming machine, 

139
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,875
which restores their round shape.       

140
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,014
other jawbreakers have hard candy in the center. 

141
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,282
the machine that makes them works like           

142
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,018
the presses drug companies use to make pills.         

143
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,687
it feeds candy powder into dies,

144
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,623
then applies up to five tons of force    

145
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,059
to compress the powder into a solid candy.      

146
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,835
now for the rest of the jawbreaker.       

147
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,571
first, they dump the candy centers  

148
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,372
into what's called a coating pan.         

149
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,577
they add a hot mixture of water,
corn syrup, and food coloring...

150
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,849
...then dextrose, a type of powdered sugar.   

151
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,918
the pan rotates for 20 minutes 

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,654
as warm air dries the ingredients over the centers. 

153
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,191
the factory repeats this step 10 times for each layer.    

154
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,260
talk about a sweet ordeal --  

155
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,331
making a jawbreaker takes four days.           

156
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,935
workers give this batch special treatment.       

157
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,938
they speckle these jawbreakers with different colors,     

158
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,375
giving them what this company calls the psychedelic look.  

159
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,551
after letting the candies dry for 24 hours,         

160
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,621
a worker adds pinches of powdered carnauba wax.   

161
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,958
this gives the jawbreakers a shiny finish.        

162
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,432
sliced open,          

163
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,701
you can see these jawbreakers have 10 layers         

164
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,170
of flavors and sugar surrounding either hard candy 

165
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,840
or bubble gum cores.      

166
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,575
they measure 2 1/4 inches in diameter --         

167
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,044
as big as a billiard ball.   

168
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,447
and if you're counting calories,
forget it.           

169
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,251
a jawbreaker is 90% sugar.   

170
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:07,332
narrator: almost every culture has used drums in some way.  

171
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,801
drums have been a part of different civilizations   

172
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,469
for thousands of years.    

173
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,673
the earliest drum shells were hollowed-out logs or gourds.  

174
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,475
different sizes created different sounds.   

175
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:22,080
today, drum shells are more sophisticated and consistent. 

176
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,421
to make drum shells,      

177
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,557
they slice an enormous rock maple log         

178
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,226
into several boards.      

179
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,962
maple is ideal for making drum shells     

180
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,099
because its hardness allows sound to resonate fully.    

181
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:43,968
each of these maple boards   

182
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,771
will be transformed into one drum shell.      

183
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,515
workers feed the boards to a ripsaw,          

184
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,584
which cuts them to the correct width.     

185
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,188
this varies depending on    
the size of the drum being made.

186
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,325
then each board goes into a planer,      

187
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,927
which shaves it thinner.    

188
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,634
a worker aligns the board with markings on a saw table. 

189
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,937
this positions the board    
to be cut to the correct length.

190
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,974
a radial arm saw does the job neatly.      

191
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:30,448
now he sizes up each board in preparation for tapering.  

192
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,954
he places a board on an angle in a jig            

193
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,492
and then moves the end against a router cutter to taper it.  

194
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,361
it takes a few passes to get it
just right.          

195
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,965
the taper needs to be about six inches long.     

196
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,504
he thins the other end of   
the board to the same dimension.

197
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,239
these tapered ends will make it
easier to bend the wood    

198
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,174
into a drum shape later.    

199
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,177
they'll also act as scarf joints        

200
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,446
which will fasten the ends of the board together     

201
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,414
when it's bent round.     

202
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,336
but first this board needs some softening up.       

203
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:29,007
an hour in the steam box does the trick.        

204
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:39,283
it's pliable enough to wind around a hot cylindrical form. 

205
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,153
steel banding secures the board
to the bending form,      

206
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,856
where it will spend 10 to 15 minutes.       

207
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,239
a worker pries apart the ends...

208
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,242
...and applies a generous amount
of glue            

209
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,212
between the tapered tips.   

210
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,387
then he removes the shim that was holding the ends apart,  

211
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,389
so that they stick together.  

212
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,459
he places a wooden guard over the glued joint.     

213
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,663
this nylon mesh band is a clamp.

214
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,198
he wraps it around the drum shell     

215
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,268
and turns a screw to pull the band tightly around the wood  

216
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,738
until it reaches 14 inches in diameter.     

217
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,446
then he fastens over a dozen steel clamps onto the joint.  

218
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,219
all these clamps will prevent any gaps            

219
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,890
from occurring in the joint as the glue sets overnight.  

220
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,429
with the joint sealed,     

221
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,766
the drum shell now spins while a cutter shaves down the edges 

222
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,335
to make it a true round shell. 

223
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,909
then they bring in another cutter.        

224
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,444
it bores into the shell,    

225
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,848
making a smooth edge and rounding the inside.    

226
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,626
he turns the drum shell around to cut it from another angle. 

227
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,469
as the shell spins,      

228
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,139
a high-speed cutter shaves the outside from top to bottom.

229
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,943
this makes the surface very smooth.          

230
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,484
it takes about a week to make a drum shell from solid wood, 

231
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,422
and it will be able to stand up
to some loud playing.     

232
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,569
narrator: there's more than one way to beat a drum,    

233
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,437
and there's more than one way to make one.          

234
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,773
earlier, we showed you how they create a drum shell  

235
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,042
from a maple plank.      

236
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,846
but a newer technique involves 
layering multiple plies of wood.

237
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,048
this process is called laminating,     

238
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,751
and you can hear the difference.

239
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,467
the laminated drum is an instrument of change.  

240
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,802
its sound is crisper      

241
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,672
than a drum crafted from a single piece of wood.  

242
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,675
to make one, they layer 11 sheets of maple. 

243
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,010
here, a worker glues on the final ply         

244
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,880
using a special adhesive.   

245
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,951
this outer layer is a luxurious bird's-eye maple. 

246
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,420
rollers press all the layers together    

247
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,023
to ensure they stick without any gaps.       

248
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,159
then they cut through the overlap          

249
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,129
to create a perfect seam.   

250
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,039
a robotic drill now takes over.

251
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,375
it drills holes of various diameters.     

252
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,844
the small ones will hold hardware.      

253
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,814
this larger one is an air vent.

254
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,121
a computerized router then cuts
the bearing edges       

255
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,190
to a 45-degree angle,     

256
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,826
and a worker sands it smooth. 

257
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,131
he uses a level surface    

258
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,534
to ensure that all the edges are perfect.          

259
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,670
if they're not, the drumheads won't fit properly.      

260
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,208
he applies an adhesive to the air hole        

261
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,078
and inserts a plastic vent.  

262
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,817
next, he inserts brackets, called lugs,          

263
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,954
into the other holes and screws them in.      

264
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,824
there are 10 lugs, spaced 36 degrees apart.    

265
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,026
they'll hold the rods     

266
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,228
that will attach the heads to the drum shell       

267
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,629
and also enable the drummer  

268
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,965
to adjust the tension on the heads.         

269
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,438
here he attaches a lever to control wires, called snares, 

270
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,040
that are to be strung across the bottom head.    

271
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,110
it's called a snare strainer. 

272
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:39,383
then he fits a plastic drumhead
over the bottom of the shell. 

273
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,585
the counter hoop goes on next. 

274
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:46,390
it has little tabs which he aligns with each lug. 

275
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,794
he slides tension rods into the holes in the tabs.  

276
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,730
using a drum key,       

277
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,466
he tightens the head to an even tension across the shell. 

278
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,941
now he blasts it with a heat gun

279
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,311
to shrink the plastic and remove any wrinkles.    

280
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,956
now he places another plastic head on the top bearing edge. 

281
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,092
since this head is the one that gets played,       

282
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,761
it's twice as thick as the bottom one.       

283
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,133
he places the chrome rim on it and tightens the tension rods. 

284
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,906
these brass brackets will hold the snare wires.        

285
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,641
he slides them under the snares

286
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,777
that are stretched tightly across a jig,         

287
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,913
putting one at each end.    

288
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,251
he measures the length,    

289
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,688
then solders the snare wires to the brackets.        

290
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,426
he snips the wires on both ends...        

291
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,097
...and unlocks each wire from the holding device.    

292
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,267
when he removes the snares,  

293
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,770
they're held together by the brackets.        

294
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,944
he slides a nylon strap into one of the brackets,   

295
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,146
then attaches the strap to a fixture          

296
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,415
just above the bottom head.  

297
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,359
the other end of the snare is attached to the strainer -- 

298
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,762
the lever that will apply tension and release it,    

299
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,198
controlling its distinctive buzz.       

300
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,039
for a bigger sound, there's the bass drum.     

301
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,041
it's made with wooden hoops.  

302
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,044
they attach the hoops to the drum shell with steel claws.  

303
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,385
as they screw the claws to the hoop,          

304
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,454
the drumhead is pulled just tightly enough      

305
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,324
to produce that low-pitched bass drum sound.        

306
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,227
now it's off to be played.   

307
