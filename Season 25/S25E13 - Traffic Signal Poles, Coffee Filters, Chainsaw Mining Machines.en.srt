00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,255
narrator: traffic-signal poles must be strong enough      

4
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,191
to bear the weight of road signs, street lights,  

5
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,660
and, of course, traffic signals.            

6
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,196
the poles are also built     

7
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,732
to withstand extreme weather conditions,   

8
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:12,604
such as high winds and heavy snow accumulation.   

9
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,341
traffic signal poles are made of high-strength steel.             

10
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,678
years of weather exposure can cause corrosion,       

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,682
so the poles are galvanized on both sides for protection.  

12
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,817
each pole has a welded plate        

13
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,888
to connect it to a perpendicular pole.     

14
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,692
the poles are made out of these steel sheets.      

15
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:35,895
the steel arrives at the factory in one large roll.        

16
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,966
they use a decoiler to unwind the sheet and flatten it out.  

17
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:43,336
then a shear cuts it to the correct length.      

18
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,574
a computer-guided plasma cutter             

19
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,910
marks short lines on both ends of the sheet.    

20
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,781
these lines indicate where to bend the flat sheet   

21
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,350
to form a round pole.      

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,055
the machine cuts the sheet into a rectangular shape,    

23
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,726
or a trapezoid shape if the pole will taper at the top.      

24
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,264
workers number the machine lines with chalk,           

25
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:16,602
giving lines directly opposite 
of each other the same number.  

26
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,203
then they transfer the sheet   

27
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,574
to a bending machine called a press brake.      

28
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,616
the press brake bends the sheet along the marked line      

29
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,152
to a preprogrammed angle.    

30
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,092
workers use a digital measuring device    

31
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,628
to make sure the first bend is accurate.           

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,164
if it is, they continue bending             

33
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,300
along the remainder of the lines,          

34
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,371
transforming the flat sheet into a multisided round pole.  

35
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,043
now the pole moves to a welding station,      

36
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,714
where hydraulic rollers apply pressure from both sides.             

37
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,850
this forces the edges of the sheet together            

38
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,854
so that a welding head can fuse the seam with molten steel.   

39
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,322
at the same time,        

40
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,858
the head deposits        
a granular powder called flux,  

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,261
which prevents air from penetrating the weld    

42
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:19,131
and weakening it.        

43
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,867
workers place the pole in a hydraulic press       

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,038
so it doesn't warp as the seam weld cools and shrinks.            

45
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,210
next, a computer-guided plasma machine             

46
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,347
cuts a connection plate out of thick steel.       

47
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,485
the machine also drills holes for the high-strength bolts   

48
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:42,822
needed to attach the plate to the traffic-signal pole.   

49
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,094
workers center the connection plate   

50
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,665
on support plates they've already welded to the pole.   

51
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:57,069
then they weld everything in place.       

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,178
next, workers weld a baseplate to the bottom of the pole.    

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,980
it has holes for the anchor bolts,      

54
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:11,817
which are used for securing the traffic signal to the street.  

55
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,989
workers inspect the welds with a testing device.      

56
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,726
it uses an electric current to magnetically draw       

57
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,062
colored powder into any defective area.     

58
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:28,868
the factory ships the finished poles to a galvanizing plant,  

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,938
where they're dipped in a series of wash tanks.    

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,075
the plant's tanks are deep enough         

61
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:39,878
to fully submerge the poles so they can treat both the inner              

62
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,015
and outer surface at the same time.        

63
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,752
now the poles go into a vat of sulfuric acid.        

64
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,822
this bath dissolves       
the more stubborn contaminants  

65
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,891
that washing can't remove.    

66
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,628
the next tank contains a chemical       

67
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,097
that weakens the surface of the poles.    

68
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,367
this allows the galvanizing metal to penetrate the steel,  

69
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,268
rather than sit on the surface.            

70
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,040
the final tank contains molten zinc.      

71
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,515
as the poles bathe in the 842-degree zinc,     

72
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,785
workers in fire-protection suits skim the surface         

73
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:25,724
to remove iron oxide and ash that floats to the top.              

74
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,994
this keeps the freshly galvanized surface clean     

75
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,832
as the poles are hoisted out of the tank and set aside to cool.              

76
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,137
because they're galvanized rather than painted,       

77
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,541
these poles are able to support traffic lights, signs,      

78
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:48,414
and street lamps for 40 years or more.      

79
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,628
narrator: in 1908, a german housewife   

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,165
came up with a solution to get 
rid of bitter-tasting sediment  

81
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,166
in her coffee.          

82
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,634
she punched nail holes in a pot               

83
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,969
and covered them with blotting paper.       

84
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,572
then she placed ground coffee on the paper           

85
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,974
and filled the pot with hot water.         

86
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,375
it worked so well        

87
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:20,579
that she started selling her coffee filters worldwide.  

88
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:25,117
these coffee filters are made of 100% cellulose fiber              

89
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,321
harvested from slow-growing pine and spruce trees         

90
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,858
in the forests of southern scandinavia.     

91
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,659
the raw material produces paper              

92
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,595
that lets about 3 ounces of water pass through it     

93
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,864
in approximately 40 seconds.   

94
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:44,402
that's the optimal saturation rate for producing good coffee.             

95
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,406
30% of the paper's cellulose content             

96
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,209
is left over from earlier production.     

97
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,412
the other 70% is raw cellulose fiber.     

98
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:57,215
the materials go into a machine called a pulper,         

99
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,286
which works like a giant food processor.   

100
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,288
it blends the raw materials with hot water,         

101
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,426
making a fiber soup called pulp.              

102
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:16,034
a paper-making machine spreads a one-inch layer of pulp              

103
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,438
across a wire-mesh belt.     

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,908
water jets cut a straight edge on both sides.          

105
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,978
as moisture drains down through the belt,        

106
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,647
the pulp forms a soggy sheet of paper.     

107
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,517
it has a water content of 80%.  

108
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,986
all this happens at an astounding pace.      

109
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,723
the machine lays down 1,300 feet of pulp a minute.   

110
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,327
at the next station, heavy compression rollers    

111
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,230
squeeze almost half the water out of the paper.        

112
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:53,271
a tool applies a crepe texture.            

113
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,874
this increases the surface area of the paper  

114
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,343
and improves filtration speed.  

115
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,284
next, they use 38 steam-heated rollers             

116
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,152
to dry the paper completely.   

117
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,755
the rollers' surface temperatures       

118
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,023
are around 250 degrees.     

119
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,426
as the finished paper exits the machine,        

120
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,696
a camera registers the location of holes,             

121
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,233
dirt, or other defects that have to be cut out.     

122
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,837
it takes the machine 45 minutes             

123
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,574
to produce an 11-mile-long sheet of coffee-filter paper.     

124
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:31,977
the roll is transferred to a cutting machine.      

125
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,113
the paper is sliced into two-foot rolls       

126
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,450
so it can fit in the filter-making machine.  

127
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,590
sensors in the filter-making machine   

128
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,760
make sure the paper is aligned correctly.      

129
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,930
at the machine's first station,            

130
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,600
tiny needles pierce holes in the paper    

131
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,736
to enhance the quality of filtration.          

132
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,239
at the next station,       

133
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:05,010
a stamp imprints        
the company logo in the paper.  

134
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,480
a knife slices the paper in half,    

135
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,882
creating two side-by-side production lines  

136
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,152
from this point forward.     

137
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:16,421
each line enters a folding station,    

138
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:21,293
where guides fold the flat sheet in half.             

139
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,295
a roller embosses a seam     

140
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,366
connecting the two layers of paper along the bottom and side.              

141
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:31,370
then a second roller cuts the conical shape of the filter.             

142
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:36,641
the machine produces 4,000 filters per minute.    

143
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:41,046
the next station cuts the filters apart      

144
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,315
and collects the leftover paper,             

145
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,884
which will be recycled into pulp.            

146
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,857
the filters are sent to an automatic counting machine             

147
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:56,995
that divides them into stacks of 80.        

148
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:01,900
the machine feeds the stacks to the packaging line.      

149
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,208
an automated packaging machine  

150
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,777
aligns each stack with a flattened box.      

151
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,749
then it opens the box with a vacuum and inserts the filters.            

152
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,355
if the machine's sensor detects a problem,        

153
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,825
like filters in the wrong position or missing filters,   

154
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:31,029
it ejects that box from the line.          

155
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:35,434
this factory produces a few different types of filters.   

156
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:38,636
how the cellulose is processed in the pulper    

157
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,640
determines how the filter will perform.          

158
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,443
for example, the factory processes cellulose finely    

159
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,447
to make filters designed to brew strong coffee.      

160
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,917
fine cellulose produces paper that drains slowly,       

161
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,820
keeping the water and coffee beans together longer,  

162
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,291
resulting in a stronger flavor.             

163
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,605
narrator: chainsaw mining machines     

164
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,939
are among the largest      

165
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,342
and heaviest chainsaws in the world.          

166
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,345
they're used in rock quarries to cut and extract        

167
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,814
some of the toughest materials on earth.            

168
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,415
the machine's massive blade   

169
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,619
can make both vertical and horizontal cuts,       

170
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,922
slicing through hard stone as if it were butter.      

171
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:36,828
hundreds of feet underground, this monster chainsaw      

172
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,899
is carving through       
geological deposits of marble.  

173
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:45,036
the chainsaw arm can rotate to make both horizontal     

174
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,639
and vertical cuts as needed.   

175
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,046
it cuts uniform blocks of marble.            

176
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:59,584
then a loader extracts     
the blocks from the rock face.  

177
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,788
they're the exact size the customer requested,     

178
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,724
thanks to the precision and power            

179
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,060
of the chainsaw mining machine.            

180
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,665
it takes several steel tubes of various dimensions      

181
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,803
to make a chainsaw mining machine.    

182
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:24,609
they use an automated saw to cut the tubes to the correct length.             

183
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,512
this one will be used for the chassis.         

184
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,754
they assemble the tubes in the correct configuration.  

185
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,225
then a worker joins them with welds.           

186
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,094
they lower the completed chassis             

187
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,597
onto the chainsaw machine tracks.   

188
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:52,104
the chassis is bolted to the fifth-wheel coupling.   

189
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:56,308
this allows the machine to rotate 360 degrees.      

190
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,248
they bring in the framework that will house the motors,   

191
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,885
oil tank, and electrical components.    

192
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,858
they bolt the framework to the chassis.         

193
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,062
the next part is a rail system  

194
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:20,198
for raising and lowering the chainsaw blade.       

195
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,271
a worker attaches the rail system     

196
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,141
to the chassis using a thick pin.        

197
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,808
this pin acts as a hinge,    

198
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,249
allowing the vertical structure           
to be folded down when needed.  

199
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:42,286
after verifying that the machine's basic framework  

200
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:46,023
fits together well, they take it apart for painting.            

201
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,493
they also paint the gear motors.             

202
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,829
this one will power the carriage            

203
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,432
that moves the blade back and forth.            

204
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,569
once all the parts have been painted,        

205
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:01,639
they reassemble the framework.  

206
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,976
next, they mount the carriage to the front of the machine.   

207
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,245
it rotates within the vertical rail     

208
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,414
to position the blade for cutting.           

209
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,985
workers then install the gear motor          

210
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:18,490
that powers the horizontal movement of the chainsaw blade.             

211
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,730
they secure it with several bolts.       

212
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:34,005
two more gear motors will drive the cutting chain   

213
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:37,042
and rotate the blade.      

214
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,950
the team mounts them to the front of the carriage,  

215
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,085
to the right of the other gear motor.     

216
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,958
at the back of the carriage,   

217
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,561
a worker assembles a gear known as a pinion.        

218
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:02,868
the pinion engages with a track called the rack.  

219
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,038
this rack-and-pinion system   

220
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,308
allows the carriage to slide back and forth.     

221
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,714
a worker folds hydraulic hoses in a long metal cage       

222
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:20,218
and bolts the cage to the front of the machine.   

223
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,599
then he connects the cutting-chain hoses     

224
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,067
to the motor,          

225
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,237
protecting the connections with metal half-flanges.     

226
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,914
they make all the electrical connections...  

227
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,753
...then screw fireproof and waterproof covers      

228
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,889
onto the electronics boxes.   

229
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,830
they program the chainsaw machine's operator screen.    

230
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,835
stay tuned, because the big chainsaw blade is next.     

231
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,516
narrator: few things are as fierce     

232
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:27,919
as the blade of a stonecutting chainsaw machine.        

233
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,456
it's 10 feet long, weighs over 1,300 pounds,    

234
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,058
and has big teeth        

235
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,995
that make cutting through solid rock look easy.      

236
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,330
it's no surprise that making one of these giant blades             

237
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,167
is a huge job.          

238
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,474
a computer-driven plasma flame cuts a large blade        

239
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,478
from a sheet of high-carbon steel.      

240
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,624
using a crane with a powerful magnet,     

241
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,060
they transfer the chainsaw blade to a milling station.      

242
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,100
here, computerized tools smooth out the steel.      

243
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,506
they also bring the blade to the correct width       

244
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,109
and carve channels for lubrication tubes.      

245
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,313
they drill holes for metal plates         

246
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,182
that will align the cutting chain.        

247
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,926
the team paints the saw and adds an attachment bar,   

248
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,863
then mounts it to the front of the chainsaw machine.     

249
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:50,268
they slide the bar into the blade support on the front.             

250
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,271
it's a critical connection because it bears the weight   

251
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,707
of the heavy blade as it saws through stone.    

252
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,345
they secure it to the blade support       

253
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,348
with a thick pin and a nut.   

254
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,357
next, they make the cutting-chain sprocket.   

255
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,960
a computer-guided tool carves toothlike projections   

256
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,230
around the rim of a steel disk.              

257
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:27,038
these teeth are designed to grab the links of the cutting chain.             

258
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,241
the sprocket is ready to be mounted      

259
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,510
to the chainsaw machine.     

260
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:38,116
an employee slides the sprocket onto a shaft           

261
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,319
protruding from the cutting-chain gear motor.  

262
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,956
he bolts the disk to the surrounding hub.     

263
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,329
next, they assemble the cutting chain.             

264
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:58,335
a two-part fastener system holds the links together.    

265
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,206
it starts with this hollow pin.              

266
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:05,142
a worker drives the hollow pin into a hole in the links     

267
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,413
using a hydraulic press.     

268
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,683
he inserts an l-shaped pin into the hollow pin.       

269
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,486
the tongue of the l-shaped pin fits into a groove        

270
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:18,223
adjacent to the hollow pin.   

271
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:24,095
the press forces the l-shaped pin into the groove.  

272
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,864
he alternates outer links and inner ones          

273
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,568
to build a 30-foot chain    
that will fit to the saw body.  

274
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,971
then another worker loops it around the saw blade  

275
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,708
and sprocket.          

276
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,248
the chain fits perfectly to the saw.           

277
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:50,387
he joins the ends of the chain with a hollow pin        

278
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:55,860
and an l-shaped pin to complete the loop.      

279
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,264
he flattens them with a hammer instead of a press              

280
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,734
because it's easier       
to use a hammer at this angle.  

281
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,669
the chain is in place,      

282
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,473
but it doesn't have the teeth it needs to cut stone yet.    

283
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:12,610
these parts, a carrier and a tungsten carbide cutting bit,              

284
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,948
give the blade its cutting edge.              

285
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,120
he places a set on each of the chain's outer links...  

286
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,691
...then screws them in.     

287
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,766
studded with tough, sharp teeth,             

288
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:38,770
this mega chainsaw is now ready for rock-cutting action.     

289
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:43,174
it cuts through stone cleanly and efficiently.         

290
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,977
its size and power        

291
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:51,015
make it a force to be reckoned with underground.          

292
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,720
despite its bulky frame,     

293
00:20:55,722 --> 00:21:00,592
this chainsaw mining machine has a wide range of motion.   

294
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,529
here, the front carriage rotates the blade        

295
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:09,367
to demonstrate how it can be repositioned between cuts.    

296
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:20,478
no matter how you slice it... that's pretty impressive.    

297
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,688
if you have any comments about the show,
