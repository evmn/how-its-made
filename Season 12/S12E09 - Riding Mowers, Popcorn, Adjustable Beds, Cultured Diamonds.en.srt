narrator: when it comes to sitting down on the job,          

4
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,422
the riding mower is just the vehicle.      

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,193
animals powered the first ones in england in the 19th century.

6
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,530
when motorized mowers came along
in the 20th century,      

7
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,198
they improved on the concept, 

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,135
and we were on our way to greener pastures.      

9
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,410
step behind the controls of a riding mower,       

10
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,346
and you can tame that unruly lawn        

11
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,348
without even breaking a sweat. 

12
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,085
the job can be done speedily  

13
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,488
because a riding mower moves at quite a clip.     

14
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,030
to make one, a robot delivers a sheet of steel to a die.   

15
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,766
the die closes with 1,000 tons of force    

16
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,634
to make a big impression.   

17
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:46,572
it shapes it into the part that holds the mowing blades --

18
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,342
what's called the mower deck. 

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,916
they transfer the mower decks to a series of presses.    

20
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:02,355
they punch holes for the blade attachments and trim the edges.

21
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,227
workers stack the decks for washing.          

22
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,666
after a treatment with a chemical rust inhibitor,

23
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,403
it's time to plunge them into a primer solution.     

24
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,207
the overhead rack delivers a negative charge to the decks,

25
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,476
while the primer has a positive charge,     

26
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:26,078
which draws it onto the decks in an even coat.        

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,347
this is called electrostatic painting.           

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,550
they assemble three spindles to mowing blades        

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,020
and hoist the mower deck over the blade assemblies.   

30
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:39,625
they bolt the head of each blade
subassembly to the mower deck. 

31
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,829
then they thread rubber belts around pulleys         

32
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,897
to drive the blades.      

33
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,301
assembly continues with gauge wheels,       

34
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,437
a protective belt casing,   

35
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,408
and a chute for the cut grass. 

36
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,345
next, they clamp a set of steel rails      

37
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,582
along with some attachments to a welding table.      

38
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:08,387
the welding table swings around
to an awaiting crew of robots. 

39
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,925
the robots move in and weld the attachments to the rails. 

40
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,127
these rails will serve as the framework  

41
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,328
for the riding mower.     

42
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,465
the attachments are for the front wheels.   

43
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,867
once the rails have been primed,

44
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,005
an overhead conveyor takes them into a paint booth. 

45
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:29,141
nozzles spray a powder paint onto the parts         

46
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,009
for an enamel-like finish.   

47
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,746
the powder that doesn't stick is recycled.          

48
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,886
they lower the engine subassembly into position   

49
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,222
to build            
the vehicle framework around it,

50
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,092
then bolt the welded and freshly glossed side rails 

51
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,893
to tubing at the front and back.

52
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,633
they attach the footrest to the frame,         

53
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,104
then install the platform for the seat.         

54
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:00,172
they assemble those nifty steering levers,  

55
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,542
which can be moved into 15 positions.       

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,448
then they install metal yokes on the front wheels.      

57
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,250
they slot the yoke's shaft into the frame rail,      

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,721
securing it with a metal snap ring.    

59
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,656
now comes the front grill,   

60
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,993
that's vented to protect the engine from overheating.  

61
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,596
the rear wheels go on next.  

62
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,398
they're more substantial than the front ones      

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,802
because this is a rear-wheel-drive machine. 

64
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,205
it's time to mount the mower deck and blades   

65
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,606
onto the vehicle.       

66
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:39,678
they position it in front and roll the vehicle over it. 

67
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,748
the workers activate a lift that elevates the worktable  

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,217
to a height that makes it easier for them 

69
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,686
to secure the mower deck to the framework.       

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:52,091
they attach the belts     
on the mower deck to the engine.

71
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:55,627
monitoring equipment will help them see if this mower's 

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,764
got what it takes to mow down the competition.  

73
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,368
they put it in gear and check the wheels      

74
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,571
to confirm that they turn at the correct speed.     

75
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,374
they adjust the transmission if they're not.        

76
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,043
they also check the electrical components,   

77
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,779
and if all systems are go, they complete the assembly.  

78
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,383
they bolt a side panel in place,

79
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,185
followed by the instrument panel.    

80
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,722
and last comes the seat, complete with armrests.     

81
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:30,529
it takes 72 minutes to assemble
one of these riding mowers,  

82
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,399
and it should be good     
for at least a decade of mowing.

83
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:54,119
good thing, because it's workload is constantly growing.

84
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,021
narrator: we don't know exactly     

85
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,157
when popcorn first exploded onto the snack scene,     

86
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,693
but it was likely thousands of years ago.    

87
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,696
popcorn grains dating back nearly 5,600 years       

88
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,166
have been discovered in caves in new mexico.         

89
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,700
and down through the ages,   

90
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,037
this unique grain just keeps popping up.     

91
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,645
nothing says it's showtime like a big bowl of popcorn.  

92
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,717
this grain has certainly made it
big in the entertainment biz. 

93
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,254
this success story has its roots
on the farm, of course.    

94
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,125
popcorn is one of six types of corn,         

95
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,061
and it's the only kind that pops.           

96
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,066
they even breed the popcorn plant       

97
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:45,671
to enhance traits like color, taste, and popability.     

98
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:49,675
by fall, the crop is ready to harvest. 

99
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:50,876
peeling back the husks     

100
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,278
reveals kernels that are smaller and harder  

101
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,814
than those of other corn.   

102
00:06:55,816 --> 00:07:01,353
at harvesting, popcorn has moisture content of 16% to 20%.

103
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,155
that's a bit too high.     

104
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,890
so to bring it down to 14%,  

105
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,760
they condition the crop in these giant bins,      

106
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:12,230
pumping warm air up through it to accelerate the drying.   

107
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,899
it's a critical step.     

108
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,302
popcorn that's too dry may not pop.          

109
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:20,906
and if it's too wet, it could spoil when stored.  

110
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:24,176
in the factory, a series of oscillating screens

111
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,512
sift chunks of cob and broken kernels       

112
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,781
out of the popcorn.      

113
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:35,320
vacuum pipes pull the finer impurities to a dust collector 

114
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,991
and suck the larger impurities into a chute.         

115
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,126
they end up in a waste bin   

116
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,430
to be discarded or used in animal feed.    

117
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,468
at this junction, the system funnels the filtered popcorn  

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,273
in one direction and the impurities in another. 

119
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,207
it's the perfect opportunity  

120
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,378
to see the difference between the two streams.    

121
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,285
the purification process continues at the gravity table.

122
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,956
its vibrating action, along with powerful fans,   

123
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,026
cause the popcorn to rise and float on air.       

124
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:17,429
in the process, kernels that are too heavy or too light

125
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:22,434
gravitate away from the center and are shunted aside.     

126
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,771
the grains in the middle of the mass are the optimal size, 

127
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,040
but leaving nothing to chance, 

128
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,843
they go through one more screening.      

129
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:34,680
the kernels now head into   
a very different kind of sorter.

130
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,187
inside, the kernels fly by an electric eye.    

131
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,058
it detects remaining debris or defective grains.      

132
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,928
the machine sends a blast of air
to get rid of them.      

133
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,698
it's time to test a sample of the production run.     

134
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,736
he pours in a half pound of kernels along with some oil.

135
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,538
as the pot reaches 446 degrees fahrenheit,    

136
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,141
the water in the kernel starts to steam.        

137
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,676
as the pressure builds,    

138
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,346
those kernels explode and turn inside out.      

139
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:10,549
this reveals the starchy part of the kernel 

140
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,185
and creates a white, fluffy puff.     

141
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,823
to pass this test,       

142
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:23,662
the popcorn has to expand 44.5 times the original volume.

143
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,568
the tester loads the popped puffs        

144
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,637
into a tube with measurements on it,    

145
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,841
and this bach of popcorn is right on the mark.     

146
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,243
as you can see, a little bit of popcorn    

147
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,578
can really go a long way,   

148
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,649
from a pea-sized kernel to a puffy, white treat    

149
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,317
in a matter of minutes.    

150
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,256
and although popcorn kernels come in a range of colors,   

151
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,561
that starchy part that's exposed
by popping is always white.  

152
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,464
now it's all in the packaging. 

153
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,533
maintaining the correct amount of moisture in each kernel   

154
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,535
is critical.          

155
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,671
heat-sealing the bag locks in the grains       

156
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,041
to keep them from drying out on a store shelf.       

157
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,282
this paper bag destined for the concession market,   

158
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,285
like movie theaters, is multilayered.        

159
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,691
it includes a vapor barrier to control moisture loss.   

160
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,827
it's taken six months to grow this popcorn      

161
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,697
and a couple of weeks more to process it.         

162
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,099
but it will all be worth it at snack time,         

163
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,634
because when these grains   

164
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,769
explode into a mountain of munchies,  

165
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:56,455
there should be enough for the whole gang.      

166
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:59,391
narrator: some people enjoy the health benefits   

167
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,259
that adjustable beds may give. 

168
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,528
others like the built-in massage system  

169
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,931
that gently rocks them to sleep
each night.          

170
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,666
whatever a person's fancy,   

171
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,268
adjustable beds can be custom-made       

172
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,039
to suit their lifestyle and total comfort and class.  

173
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,947
an adjustable bed helps you  
sleep with a push of the button.

174
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,881
this convenient hand control  

175
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,818
easily adjusts the head and foot positions  

176
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,188
to the contours of your body. 

177
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,826
it all starts with a quilting machine.    

178
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,029
it sews foam padding, fire retardant material,    

179
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,933
and two layers of backing together.           

180
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,104
hundreds of thousands of stitches          

181
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:50,409
produce a quilted top panel with comfort and style in mind.

182
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,315
a machine cuts the panel to a specific bed size.     

183
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:59,985
the four layers that make up the quilted top panel     

184
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:04,856
add luxury and security to the mattress.        

185
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,261
meanwhile, another worker prepares the coil spring.   

186
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:13,865
he covers it with protective netting.    

187
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:18,937
this high-density foam pad comes next.          

188
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,474
he staples the pad and netting to the coil spring.      

189
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,811
he puts a bottom cover on the mattress        

190
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,947
and tucks the foam and coil spring inside.    

191
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,690
he turns the mattress over, covers it with netting,    

192
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,826
then staples it.        

193
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,363
he puts another high-density foam pad on this side     

194
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,764
and staples it.        

195
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,368
then he lays down the quilted top panel.     

196
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,172
he holds on to the backing layer

197
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,442
and staples the top panel onto the spring.        

198
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,379
he fills the corners with packing,         

199
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,315
which gives them a nice, firm edge.       

200
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,517
then he sews the mattress together     

201
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,652
with the tape-edge machine   

202
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:12,123
that uses binding tape and fire-retardant thread.   

203
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,458
the tape-edge machine     

204
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,927
makes a perfect seam all the way around       

205
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,429
and finishes the mattress.   

206
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,603
next, a length of steel rod  
goes into a thread-roll machine.

207
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,406
its threaded rollers use hydraulic pressure     

208
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,876
to transform the rod into a worm screw.       

209
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,415
they put the worm screw and gear assembly inside a casing. 

210
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,952
the worm and nylon gears will turn a steel shaft,    

211
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,588
which raises and lowers the bed.

212
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,160
a worker closes the motor casing.    

213
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,964
another worker assembles the bed's foundation.

214
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,368
he puts flexible nylon hinges between platform boards    

215
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,971
and staples them in place.   

216
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:04,575
he turns the platform over and staples them again.    

217
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:09,214
he protects the platform with a polyester dust cover.  

218
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,888
a worker now bolts a steel frame
to the platform.        

219
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,529
he fastens a head motor to one of the metal tubes.   

220
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,868
to another metal tube, he bolts a foot motor.     

221
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:37,742
finally, he attaches a massage motor.  

222
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,880
then a worker covers a support 
fixture with a cotton bed cover.

223
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,682
he puts down four-inch high density foam,  

224
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,853
then places the fully assembled frame on top. 

225
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,792
he pulls up the bed cover and upholsters it to the base. 

226
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,430
the bed is ready for its adjustable bed sheets, 

227
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:02,667
but not before a final testing for quality control.      

228
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,842
every part must pass a flex test
the operator controls.     

229
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,981
the paper-protected foundation,
the steel frame,        

230
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,316
and all three motors      

231
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,586
must allow the bed       
to rise and descend with gentle,

232
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,454
uninterrupted precision --   

233
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,259
exactly as it would      
in the comfort of your own home.

234
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,804
all you need now is a bowl of popcorn, a movie, 

235
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:58,956
and perhaps a soothing massage,
and then it's lights-out.   

236
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,761
narrator: diamonds are a flash 
of brilliance for mother nature.

237
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:06,163
formed in the earth's crust by intense heat and pressure, 

238
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,033
they're prized for their crystalline beauty. 

239
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,304
but now mother nature has some serious competition, 

240
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:14,171
because gem-quality diamonds  

241
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,975
are actually being grown in laboratories.        

242
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,451
diamonds grown in labs are dazzling even the skeptics.

243
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,986
while lower-grade diamonds   

244
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,188
have long been grown for industrial use,       

245
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,590
they were more grit than glitter.         

246
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,228
but these diamonds have that gem-quality sparkle. 

247
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,933
they start with a robotic laser.

248
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,070
it slices slivers from a chunk of real diamond  

249
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,607
to produce tiny wafers.    

250
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:52,277
they're five millimeters wide and a quarter millimeter thick.

251
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,647
that's about as thin as a human hair.        

252
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,618
the laser blackens the diamond,

253
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,356
so they place it on a steel block for polishing.

254
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,793
they rim the wafer with epoxy to keep it from sliding around.

255
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,102
this epoxy requires an activator,     

256
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,171
so they brush it on next.   

257
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:24,442
the chemical reaction causes  
the epoxy to solidify in seconds

258
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,512
to firmly secure the sliver on the block.         

259
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,051
they screw the block to a threaded rod       

260
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,121
that's attached to a metal arm.

261
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:39,190
they lower the block and its diamond wafer     

262
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,993
onto a wheel that's swirling with diamond grit.       

263
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:48,066
they apply weights to press  
the diamond wafer into the grit.

264
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,601
and as the wheel spins,    

265
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,003
it creates the necessary friction     

266
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,605
to polish away the grime.   

267
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,942
a level confirms the wafer is correctly positioned.    

268
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,612
diamonds are the hardest of minerals,  

269
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,015
and only other diamonds can effectively polish one.  

270
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,551
the difference is impressive. 

271
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,956
the diamond wafer has gone from sooty to crystal clear,  

272
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,392
and now it's ready to grow.  

273
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,764
a technician places several wafers     

274
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,602
on a special metal pedestal using a suction tool.     

275
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,640
he arranges them in a uniform pattern,     

276
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,975
giving them room to expand,  

277
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:36,047
because these slivers of diamond
are destined for bigger things. 

278
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,559
he lowers a metal chamber over them.           

279
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,165
pumps inject hydrogen and methane gas,        

280
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,535
and the machine heats them to thousands of degrees    

281
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,470
at just the right pressure.  

282
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,940
the gasses form a plasma,   

283
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:06,778
which rains onto the diamond wafers and causes them to grow.

284
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,682
after just two weeks,     

285
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:12,817
the diamond slivers have grown into stones     

286
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,087
at least 10 times the original size.       

287
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,223
it's quite a transformation.  

288
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,624
but these diamonds in the rough

289
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,162
need a lot more work to really sparkle.       

290
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,499
that dab epoxy onto the tip of a pointed steel rod     

291
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,766
called a dop          

292
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:33,571
and center the lab-grown diamond
on the epoxy-coated tip.    

293
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,178
then it's into the laser booth,

294
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,248
where the dop is gripped by a robotic arm.  

295
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,921
it turns it so a laser can trim the lab-grown diamond 

296
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,923
from all sides.        

297
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:57,228
the process exposes the crystal clarity of the gem.

298
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,204
a technician checks the quality
of the lab-grown diamond    

299
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,407
with a jeweler's magnifying glass.       

300
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,876
then she lowers it into another polishing wheel. 

301
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,345
it's similar to the one that was used to clean it   

302
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,080
when it was just a sliver.   

303
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,017
but this wheel actually contours the grown stone    

304
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,419
to give it that classic diamond shape.  

305
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:25,022
the process brings out all of its glittering facets. 

306
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:29,360
it's taken just a couple of weeks to grow this diamond. 

307
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,163
the process puts geology on fast-forward, 

308
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,899
because it takes tens of millions of years   

309
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:39,570
for real forces to push real  
diamonds to the earth's surface.

310
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,639
only very sophisticated testing

311
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:45,443
can separate the lab-grown diamonds from the mined ones. 

312
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,045
but since they cost 15% less, 

313
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,083
you'll notice the difference in your pocketbook.      

314
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,060
if you have any comments about the show,        

315
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,997
or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows,
