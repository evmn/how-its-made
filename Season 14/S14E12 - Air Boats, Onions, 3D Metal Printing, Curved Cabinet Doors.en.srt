00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,587
narrator: an airboat is a flat-bottomed vessel   

2
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,522
with a huge propeller at the back.          

3
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,191
all of the boat's mechanics are above the water line,   

4
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,727
and just a bit of the hull rests below.          

5
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,997
this makes the airboat the preferred mode of transport

6
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:08,334
through shallow water,     
particularly marshes and swamps.

7
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,271
[ engine turns over ]     

8
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,208
to steer an airboat,      

9
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,812
large vertical rudders direct the propellers' airflow.

10
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:28,154
at full speed, an airboat can hit 62 miles per hour.   

11
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:34,627
the boat's hull is made of aluminum      

12
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,695
that's about 2/10 of an inch thick.     

13
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,564
workers stiffen the hull's bottom plate    

14
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,602
with aluminum "t" bars positioned 7 inches apart.   

15
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,706
after they clamp the "t" bars, 

16
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,709
a jig descends to hold everything steady   

17
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,243
as workers weld on the strips. 

18
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,249
next, they weld on aluminum sheets        

19
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,719
to form the sides of the hull. 

20
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,922
at the front, they push the bottom up for welding,   

21
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,425
giving the boat a curved bow. 

22
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,534
they complete the hull     

23
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:19,071
by welding on a sheet across the back to form the transom. 

24
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,273
to that, they weld a splash plate    

25
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,076
that prevents water from coming over the edge   

26
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,811
into the back of the boat.   

27
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,752
next, they weld various parts to the front of the boat    

28
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,154
to reinforce it structurally  

29
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,556
and to create a covered storage area.    

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,427
once that's done,       

31
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,696
they screw a thick sheet of high-resistance polymer   

32
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,431
to the bottom of the hull.   

33
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,767
should the boat scrape against a rock,        

34
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:50,536
this layer will shield the hull
from damage.          

35
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,914
once that's secured,      

36
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,648
they paint the inside of the boat     

37
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,117
with a blend of epoxy and paint.

38
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,887
this forms a layer of what they call "webbing."  

39
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,930
on the outside of the boat,  

40
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,732
they apply a coat of primer  

41
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,801
followed by two coats of durable marine paint.    

42
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,606
meanwhile, others have constructed    

43
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,543
and painted the boat's above-water structure      

44
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,945
out of steel or aluminum tubes.

45
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,749
the rigging, as the structure's called,   

46
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,418
supports the mechanics, two fiberglass seats,     

47
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,120
and the instrument panel.   

48
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,360
they mount a belt-driven reduction unit  

49
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,096
to the boat's gasoline engine. 

50
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,301
this unit reduces the propeller speed  

51
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,304
in conjunction with a preassembled set of gears.  

52
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,506
without it, the propeller would turn    

53
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,641
at the same rate as the engine.

54
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,376
this would exceed       
the propeller's operating limits

55
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,178
and destroy it.        

56
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,648
the engine is now ready    

57
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,716
to take its place at the rear of the rigging.  

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,019
heavy-duty bolts secure it.  

59
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,925
under the engine goes a 50-gallon fuel tank --    

60
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,328
at the very back, an aluminum radiator.     

61
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,000
then they bolt the rigging to the hull's "t" bars.    

62
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:36,475
next comes a floor panel and a 3-passenger bench seat  

63
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,844
with a storage compartment underneath.          

64
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,883
the boat's exhaust system   

65
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,952
consists of stainless-steel pipe,    

66
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,553
which attaches with band clamps

67
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,422
to a header coming off the engine.     

68
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,631
the other end leads to a stainless-steel muffler. 

69
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:02,501
from that, an exhaust pipe runs out the rear of the boat. 

70
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,304
next, they mount the propeller guard,      

71
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,373
a stainless-steel safety cage 

72
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,109
that surrounds the engine and propeller.   

73
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,345
the three propeller blades are made of carbon fiber.    

74
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,716
aluminum rudders steer the boat

75
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,052
by directing the propellers' airflow.    

76
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,289
cables or rods connect the rudders to a control stick.

77
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,927
smaller airboats, like this one,

78
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,596
are ideal for hunting and fishing.    

79
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,531
there are also much larger pleasure models        

80
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,869
that can carry 18 or more passengers on excursions.   

81
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,354
narrator: historians believe       

82
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,223
consumption of this common vegetable    

83
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,693
dates back to prehistoric times,
when it grew in the wild.   

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,362
man eventually learned to cultivate onions,      

85
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,565
and this strong-tasting plant bulb           

86
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,635
became a food staple of many ancient civilizations 

87
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,936
throughout the world.     

88
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:21,046
in ancient egypt, the onion was an object of worship,   

89
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,515
the inner structure of concentric rings      

90
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,117
symbolizing the eternal circle of life.  

91
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,922
today mechanical harvesters  
pull the bulbs out of the ground

92
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,657
and lay them out in rows.   

93
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,459
after drying for a day or two, 

94
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,929
a tractor collects them into large baskets for storage.

95
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,868
to prevent spoilage,      

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,206
the onions are stored at between
34 and 36 degrees fahrenheit. 

97
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,278
when they arrive from the field,

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,279
their first stop is a cooling tunnel      

99
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,949
from which powerful fans remove the heat.        

100
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,485
the vegetables take about five hours     

101
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,453
to cool down to the storage temperature.  

102
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:08,093
the grower separates the onions
according to variety and size, 

103
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,296
then either bags them for sale whole         

104
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,631
or sells them to a processing plant.     

105
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,704
at the processing plant,    

106
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,973
workers load the onions on a conveyer         

107
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,742
that leads to the peeling and cutting stations.     

108
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:33,651
a cutter chops off each bulb's top and tail simultaneously.  

109
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,256
it also scores the skin to prep it for peeling.    

110
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:46,131
the onions then move into a  
custom-designed peeling machine.

111
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,734
it uses a combination of air and water pressure   

112
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,002
to blow off the skin.     

113
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,012
the onions then roll off the peeler           

114
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,215
and pass before quality-control
workers            

115
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,418
who swiftly cut away bruises and any other imperfections,  

116
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,621
as well as anything the cutter and peeler might have missed.  

117
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,564
the next machine rinses the onions       

118
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,899
with cold, ozonated water that kills bacteria.      

119
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,505
then the onions pass through a metal detector,       

120
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,507
just as a precautionary measure.

121
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,910
at this point, there's a fork in the processing road.    

122
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:36,181
one direction leads to slicing,
the other to dicing.      

123
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,315
on the slicing line,      

124
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,318
workers load the onions into tubes           

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,720
that feed slicing blades.   

126
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,389
these blades are adjustable to output slices        

127
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,892
anywhere from 1 1/2 to 25 millimeters thick.    

128
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,665
workers gather up the complete slices      

129
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,801
and fill 5-pound plastic trays.

130
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,675
a conveyer moves the trays through a machine       

131
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,211
that seals them with plastic film.       

132
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,680
the film has microperforations     

133
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,683
designed to allow in just the right amount of oxygen

134
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,118
to keep the onions fresh.   

135
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,690
on the dicing line, meanwhile, 

136
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,426
the onions collide head-on with a rotary blade      

137
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,162
that chops them to bits    

138
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:26,365
ranging from 3 to 25 millimeters
in diameter.          

139
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:30,034
the diced onions then go for a bath in cold water.   

140
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,705
chopping an onion releases juice from its tissue,

141
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,108
paving the way for bacteria to grow.     

142
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,911
this cold-water treatment reverses the damage,      

143
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,112
restoring shelf life.     

144
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,517
next, an escalator transports them        

145
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,854
from a spin dryer to the packaging department.  

146
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,722
there, an automatic scale   

147
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,525
portions out the specific weight
they're packaging       

148
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,926
in this production run.    

149
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,130
when the target weight is reached,          

150
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,797
a trapdoor swings open,    

151
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,234
dropping the portion into the waiting package.   

152
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,340
restaurants buy their diced onions in jumbo-sized bags.  

153
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,807
the filling machine      

154
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,678
automatically forms plastic into a bag,   

155
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,948
adds a zipper closure, then seals the bag.      

156
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,223
for grocery stores,      

157
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,291
the factory packages smaller quantities       

158
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,828
of both diced and sliced onions
in plastic containers.     

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,233
kept in the fridge, they remain fresh       

160
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,568
for at least a couple of weeks.

161
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,606
for busy cooks, it's a     
convenient, no-tears time-saver.

162
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,792
narrator: building complex shapes out of metal      

163
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,128
typically requires weeks of manufacturing,       

164
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,531
using tailor-made casts    
or precise machining techniques.

165
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,334
but 3-d metal printers are faster and cheaper.    

166
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,468
they build objects       

167
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,005
from successive layers of metal powder,        

168
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,974
which are then fused together at high temperatures.     

169
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,548
3-d metal printing makes it easy

170
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,151
to manufacture complex metal shapes      

171
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,353
using a fully automated process.

172
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:32,090
every item starts with a computer model of the object.

173
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,961
this is the build box in which the object will be created.  

174
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,630
a technician plugs in electric heaters        

175
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,832
and pours super fine stainless-steel powder     

176
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,235
into the box.         

177
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:45,604
the heat will keep the metal powder from clumping.

178
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,108
he pushes the box into the machine,       

179
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,244
then fills the feed box with more stainless-steel powder,  

180
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,614
which will be needed later in the process.        

181
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,520
the machine spreads the first layer    

182
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,956
of stainless-steel powder in the build box.       

183
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,898
tubes carry a binding substance
to the machine's printhead.  

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,335
this binder acts like a weak glue     

185
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,371
and is injected in very narrow jets by the printhead.     

186
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,412
as the printhead moves back and forth      

187
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,414
over the stainless-steel powder bed,          

188
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,017
it deposits binder at the exact locations     

189
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,685
specified by the computer.   

190
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,360
as soon as the printhead    

191
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,762
has finished printing a full slice of the object,  

192
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,499
powerful overhead heaters ensure
the layer is completely dry.  

193
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,905
a roller applies a new layer of powder     

194
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,807
a fraction of a millimeter thick.     

195
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,047
then the printhead adds a new layer of binder.  

196
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,850
this builds the object from the bottom up.      

197
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,790
the printing process takes several hours.      

198
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,399
once the layering is done,   

199
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,202
they put the build box in a curing oven        

200
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,205
heated to 350 degrees fahrenheit
for 24 hours.         

201
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:31,076
this will evaporate all the moisture and harden the binder.

202
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
they vacuum out the loose powder,       

203
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:35,947
and the piece emerges,     

204
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,482
its stainless-steel particles 

205
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,584
lightly held together by the binder.         

206
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:47,025
they gently blow air to dislodge any excess powder. 

207
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,962
at this point, the object is very porous   

208
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,031
and contains about 40% air.  

209
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,432
it is so fragile        

210
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,070
that it can easily be crushed with bare hands.        

211
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,979
using more stainless-steel powder,    

212
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,247
they prepare another box    

213
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,183
in which the piece will be infused with bronze.  

214
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,452
they're making a support structure      

215
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,054
on which to rest the pieces  

216
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,523
during the next phase of the process.        

217
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,537
they carefully fill the box with alumina oxide grit,    

218
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,141
which will support the pieces during the infusion process.  

219
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,615
this dam prevents the grit from leaking out.       

220
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,284
now they pour in bronze powder.

221
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,757
the piece is then heated in a furnace          

222
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,561
at more than 2,000 degrees fahrenheit for 24 hours.    

223
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,896
this melts the bronze,     

224
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,232
which then gets sucked up into the piece         

225
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,633
like water by a sponge.    

226
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:08,173
infused with bronze, the piece is now solid metal. 

227
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,611
they knock off the base with a hammer.         

228
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,589
it's taken just a few days   

229
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,260
to build this intricately designed piece of hardware.  

230
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,995
it can now be polished, gold-plated,          

231
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,497
or painted to match any decor. 

232
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,203
whether they build sophisticated door handles   

233
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,538
or fancy sculptures,      

234
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,341
3-d metal printers work faster than conventional methods   

235
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,910
at just a fraction of the cost.

236
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,094
narrator: to create classic, elegant style     

237
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,496
in a kitchen or bathroom,   

238
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,965
decorators typically use traditional materials     

239
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,500
such as wood and marble.    

240
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,968
curved cabinets can heighten that effect,   

241
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,638
but their unique style comes at a higher price    

242
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,641
because for the most part, these elegant doors      

243
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,944
must be custom-ordered and handmade.         

244
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:28,053
most cabinet doors produced  
by this factory are custom-made.

245
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,725
they typically start out as a sketch,          

246
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:37,128
which the factory transforms into a technical drawing.   

247
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,863
they then use that drawing   

248
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,766
to program the automated woodworking machines.     

249
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,004
after cutting all the pieces of wood they'll need,     

250
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,006
they run each one through a planer.       

251
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,813
it simultaneously smoothes both
the top and bottom surfaces.  

252
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,884
a cabinet door consists of a center panel       

253
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,618
surrounded by a frame.     

254
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,821
this machine, called a molder, 

255
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:05,090
carves the frame's two vertical pieces      

256
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,825
and cuts a groove on one edge 

257
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,060
into which the center panel will fit.   

258
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,364
to construct that center panel,

259
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,765
a worker feeds planks through a wood shaper     

260
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,500
that bevels their edges.    

261
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,636
the angle of the bevel is such 

262
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,773
that when the pieces line up side by side,         

263
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,241
they'll form a curve.     

264
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,381
after trimming the pieces to the length of the center panel,

265
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,118
another worker runs them through a glue applicator,   

266
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,287
which coats the beveled edges in adhesive.          

267
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,193
then she lines up the pieces in an assembly fixture     

268
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,664
that's been adjusted to the  
center panel's width and radius.

269
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,070
once everything's positioned, 

270
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,840
she applies clamps which force the pieces tightly together.  

271
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,345
the glue sets in 20 minutes.  

272
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,086
once the glue cures to full strength,       

273
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,689
the piece goes onto a computer-guided router.   

274
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,692
it rounds both sides of the panel          

275
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,927
for a smooth, seamless look.  

276
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,368
this particular door has a concave curve.      

277
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,771
others can have a convex curve or a crossbow curve,      

278
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,406
which is "s"-shaped.      

279
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,049
the same router now automatically switches   

280
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,719
to a different type of tool and profiles the panel's edges.

281
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,321
it also carves a tongue    

282
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,324
that fits into the groove in the frame pieces.      

283
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,129
the same machine can then load another tool   

284
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,597
to engrave a custom motif   

285
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,600
or monogram if the customer desires.    

286
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,476
next, a computer-guided sander smoothes out the panel,    

287
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,912
preparing the wood for stain or paint later on.  

288
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,887
making the frame's horizontal pieces        

289
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,357
is more complex than making the vertical ones       

290
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,759
because the top and bottom   

291
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,696
have to curve just like the center panel.  

292
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,799
workers coat thin slices of wood
with heat-activated glue,   

293
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:31,603
then stack them over a curved form in a press.   

294
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,244
the press squeezes the slices tightly together.       

295
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,985
then a high-frequency electrical
current generates intense heat, 

296
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,456
triggering the adhesive.    

297
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,991
the bonded slices exit the press

298
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:58,129
looking like a solid, curved piece of wood.     

299
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,465
once the glue has set,     

300
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:04,202
a computer-guided router carves
it to the same decorative style

301
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,603
as the vertical pieces.    

302
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,204
it also miters the corners   

303
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,941
so the horizontal and vertical frame pieces   

304
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,078
will fit together seamlessly. 

305
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,347
all that's left to do is glue the frame to the panel.

306
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,283
the tongue running along the panel's perimeter     

307
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,320
fits neatly into the groove of each frame piece.      

308
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,627
workers now clamp everything together      

309
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,296
and let the glue set for a half-hour.        

310
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,067
then the cabinet door goes off for painting or staining.   

311
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,041
this factory produces curved cabinets        

312
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,642
in 10 different types of wood 

313
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,778
and dozens of colors and finishes,    

314
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,581
opening the door to endless design possibilities.     

315
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,584
