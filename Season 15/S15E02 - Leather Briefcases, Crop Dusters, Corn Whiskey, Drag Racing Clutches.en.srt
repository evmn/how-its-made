1
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:54,520
      narrator: briefcases      
   come in many styles today.   

2
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,256
        the classic type        
   is a rigid rectangular box   

3
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,192
 made up of two hinged sections 
      that close together.      

4
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,728
     it's often referred to     
       as an attaché case       

5
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,598
  because it was traditionally  
      the type of briefcase     

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,570
 used in diplomatic circles by  
 cultural or military attachés. 

7
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,811
      these luxury attachés     
    are entirely handcrafted,   

8
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,147
        made from english       
         bridal leather,        

9
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,251
  a fine leather traditionally  
     used for horse saddles.    

10
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,424
  the cutter lays out patterns  
     for the various parts,     

11
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,692
     then trims around them.    

12
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,028
 leather, being an animal hide, 

13
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,831
       naturally has scars      
  and blemishes here and there, 

14
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,167
         so he's careful        
  to select blemish-free areas  

15
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,569
  for use as the main surfaces. 

16
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,509
   next he uses a punch press   

17
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,445
   to cut out what are called   
       foundation boards,       

18
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,581
      which will reinforce      
          the leather.          

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,188
    at this point, an expert    
  leather craftsman takes over. 

20
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,658
  he positions each foundation  
      board on the leather.     

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,993
          using a tool          
      called a bone folder,     

22
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,963
   he marks where the leather   
   will fold over each board.   

23
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,270
    then he coats the boards    
  with leather-bonding glue...  

24
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,442
      ...and positions them     
 along the fold lines he marked.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,946
  with a tool called a sleeker, 

26
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,950
    he pushes out air pockets   
        and excess glue.        

27
00:02:30,952 --> 00:02:34,620
    this ensures a thorough,    
       wrinkle-free bond.       

28
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,289
        next, with a tool       
     called a stitch marker,    

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,959
     he perforates the edges    
         of the leather.        

30
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,762
 this ensures the stitching will
 be straight and evenly spaced. 

31
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,365
     it also sets the angle     
        of the stitches,        

32
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,869
  essential for both aesthetics 
         and durability.        

33
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,840
   now he bevels the leather.   

34
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,375
           this leaves          
   what's known as a raw edge,  

35
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,513
 which he then colors and seals 
      with a reddish stain      

36
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,715
         that highlights        
    the tan-colored leather.    

37
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,957
     the attaché case frame     
        is made of steel.       

38
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,863
          the craftsman         
      uses contact adhesive     

39
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,333
    to mate the frame to the    
  foundation board and leather. 

40
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,143
   now he can sew the leather.  

41
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,879
        he inserts an awl       
       in each stitch hole      

42
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,548
         to clear a path        
 through the leather and boards.

43
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,684
    then he passes two strong   
    saddle-stitching needles    

44
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,220
     in opposite directions,    

45
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:45,424
 pulling the pure-linen threads 
       waxed with tallow.       

46
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:50,429
     next he rivets in place    
   two traditional-style locks  

47
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,665
  made of hand-polished brass.  

48
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:59,905
then he constructs the handle by
sewing several layers of leather

49
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,640
    around a piece of steel.    

50
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,244
   the handle has a raised rib  
     on the top and bottom.     

51
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,580
these risers, as they're called,

52
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,882
         make the handle        
      comfortable to hold.      

53
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:13,586
 he uses the bone folder to fit 
  a piece of finishing leather  

54
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,188
   snugly against the risers.   

55
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,694
   he glues finishing leather   
   around the handle ends...    

56
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,101
        ...feeds each end       
     through a brass ring...    

57
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:36,475
   ...then folds over the ends  
      to lock in the rings.     

58
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,684
          then he wraps         
  the rest of the leather under 

59
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,288
  and hand-stitches all around. 

60
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,890
        the rings attach        
     to brass handle plates,    

61
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,461
which he secures from the inside
     with washers and bolts.    

62
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,469
        next he glues in        
   the lid-pocket assembly...   

63
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:09,308
   ...an all-leather organizer  
     that contains pen loops    

64
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,311
      and pockets for files     
       and business cards.      

65
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,782
  finally, he lines the bottom  
 section with sheepskin leather 

66
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,519
       that's been coated       
     with a semigloss glaze     

67
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,556
    so it can be wiped clean    
       with a damp cloth.       

68
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,127
   the outer leather is strong  
      and weather-resistant     

69
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,796
  because it's been tanned with 
natural plant and tree extracts,

70
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,200
    then conditioned by hand    
   with fish oils and lanolin,  

71
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,936
    centuries-old techniques    
         they still use         

72
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,706
  to make luxury leather goods  
             today.             

73
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:55,554
            narrator:           
   crop dusters are airplanes   

74
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,089
      specially outfitted       
      for aerial spraying.      

75
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,958
 farmers use them to seed fields

76
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,228
      and apply pesticides      
         and fertilizer.        

77
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,431
    the aquaculture industry    
    uses them to feed fish,     

78
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:09,567
and emergency crews fly them to 
spread retardant on forest fires

79
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,438
 and dispersants on oil spills. 

80
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,111
     depending on its size,     

81
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,981
     a crop duster can carry    
       up to 2,700 liters       

82
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,717
   of liquid or dry material.   

83
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,188
      the plane is designed     
  to be able to swoop down low  

84
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,893
       to accurately cover      
     the target spray area.     

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,001
         at the factory,        
       they manually weld       

86
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,470
   lightweight aircraft-grade   
           steel tubes          

87
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,273
     to construct the frame     
        of the fuselage.        

88
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,286
          next they use         
     spring-loaded fasteners    

89
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:03,155
    to affix aluminum panels    
          to the sides.         

90
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:08,093
   an anti-rust coating turns   
   the aluminum golden color.   

91
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,229
 all the plane's aluminum parts 
      require this coating,     

92
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,166
  because many of the chemicals 
       crop dusters carry       

93
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,601
         are corrosive.         

94
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,839
    the tank that holds those   
  chemicals is called a hopper. 

95
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,443
    the factory molds it out    
  of many layers of fiberglass, 

96
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,112
      which is deliberately     
          transparent.          

97
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,048
     this enables the pilot     
       to see at a glance       

98
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,518
    roughly how much chemical   
            remains.            

99
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,522
inside each of the plane's wings

100
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,659
  is a row of vertical supports 
          called webs.          

101
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:44,596
   to make each web, they lay   
a soft aluminum sheet on a mold,

102
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,268
 place a rubber mat on top, then
 load the assembly into a press.

103
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,938
a built-in water bag distributes
      the pressure evenly.      

104
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,408
         this helps form        
  the aluminum sheet perfectly. 

105
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,677
     next they soak the web     
         for a half-hour        

106
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,480
    in molten sodium chloride   

107
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,282
          at more than          
     900 degrees fahrenheit.    

108
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,553
 then they immediately submerge 
   the web in lukewarm water.   

109
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,689
          this triggers         
      a molecular reaction      

110
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,658
   that hardens the aluminum.   

111
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,362
   each wing contains 32 webs.  

112
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,299
    technicians line them up    
     in an assembly fixture     

113
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,602
      in between the wing's     
 horizontal beams called spars. 

114
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,846
  once they've riveted the webs 
          to the spars,         

115
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,515
    they cover the structure    
      with aluminum panels      

116
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,783
  using spring clamps for now.  

117
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,052
  the panels have holes in them 

118
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,456
  to allow regular inspections  
    of the structure inside.    

119
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,393
   after riveting the panels,   

120
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,764
    technicians screw covers    
   onto the inspection holes.   

121
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:58,870
they also seal the seams between
    panels with liquid rubber   

122
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,006
  so chemicals can't penetrate. 

123
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,277
  next they install the engine  
       and the propeller,       

124
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,148
      which ranges from 750     
      to 1,400 horsepower.      

125
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,619
    the prop has from three     
    to five aluminum blades.    

126
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:20,492
 now the equipment that releases
   the chemicals from the air.  

127
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,962
      for spraying liquids,     
  they hook up horizontal pipes 

128
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,565
    lined with spray nozzles    
          called booms.         

129
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,438
     to apply dry chemicals     
        or disperse seed,       

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,940
         the flight crew        
       detaches the booms       

131
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,642
      and installs a large      
     stainless-steel funnel     

132
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:41,313
        called a spreader       
    under the plane's belly.    

133
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,915
        at release time,        

134
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,851
     the pilot opens a door     
  at the bottom of the hopper,  

135
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,319
        enabling the wind       
    to draw out the contents    

136
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,855
      through the spreader.     

137
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,524
       to spray liquids,        
       a wind-driven pump       

138
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,260
    moves the hopper contents   
          to the booms.         

139
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,072
    technicians now assemble    
           and install          

140
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,908
   the instrumentation panel.   

141
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,422
       to fill the hopper       
     with liquid chemicals,     

142
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:28,694
 they connect a pump to a valve 
 on the side of the crop duster.

143
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:32,097
       for dry chemicals,       
 they just lift the hopper's lid

144
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,266
        and fill 'er up.        

145
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,057
            narrator:           
 more than three centuries ago, 

146
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,727
      american bootleggers      
 made corn whiskey by moonlight 

147
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,329
     to avoid being detected    
     by the tax authorities,    

148
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,332
       and so this whiskey      
   became known as moonshine.   

149
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,335
 today, that whiskey has emerged
   from the shadows of history  

150
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,706
  and is produced legally, but  
 people still call it moonshine.

151
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,948
 it was the nectar of outlaws --

152
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,019
    clear, fresh corn whiskey   
       that's 50% alcohol,      

153
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,688
      and centuries later,      
  it still has a potent appeal. 

154
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,624
          in virginia,          

155
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,027
  they still make this whiskey  
      the traditional way,      

156
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:40,299
   allowing corn to germinate   
  in a process called malting.  

157
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,768
     they mix a small amount    
      of the malted kernels     

158
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,607
with regular corn in a big tank,
then funnel the mix into a mill.

159
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:54,512
        inside this mill,       
 automated hammers grind the mix

160
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,715
   to a cornmeal consistency.   

161
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,384
  this frees some of the starch 

162
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:03,055
    and exposes it to enzymes   
    from the malted kernels.    

163
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:06,325
          those enzymes         
  convert the starch to sugar.  

164
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,326
           they'll use          
    some of this ground corn    

165
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,162
  to make a big batch of yeast. 

166
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,934
 they add it to water in a tank 

167
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:19,204
           and boil it          
 until it becomes a thick soup. 

168
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,540
         once it reaches        
    the desired consistency,    

169
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,376
      they allow it to cool     
      to room temperature.      

170
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:31,550
they add yeast and blow air into
the mix to help the yeast grow, 

171
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:35,620
    making this one big batch   
        of liquid yeast.        

172
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,889
 in another tank, a ton of corn 

173
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,626
        is being blended        
     with water and boiled.     

174
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:44,329
  this breaks down more of the  
 starch, converting it to sugar.

175
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,903
 once cooled, they pump the mix 
     and the liquefied yeast    

176
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,372
   into the fermentation tank.  

177
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,507
   over a period of four days,  

178
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,444
    the yeast turns the sugar   
           to alcohol.          

179
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,580
   the process also generates   
         carbon dioxide,        

180
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,317
         which is vented        
      into the atmosphere.      

181
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,255
 every so often, the brewmaster 
      scoops up some liquid     

182
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,590
       and scrutinizes it.      

183
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,258
     if it looks too thick,     

184
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,162
     the conversion of sugar    
 to alcohol is not yet complete.

185
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,199
     but when the viscosity     
         is just right,         

186
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,469
       they pump the batch      
    into a big copper still.    

187
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,404
  it's just like the type used  

188
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,808
        to make moonshine       
 in the backwoods centuries ago.

189
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,477
          they heat it          
     to 82 degrees celsius.     

190
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,547
  at that temperature, alcohol  
 will boil, but water will not. 

191
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,282
         as the alcohol         
       boils off the mix,       

192
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,318
         it's recovered         
      through a condenser.      

193
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,221
      the recovered liquid      
         is 80% alcohol.        

194
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,023
    talk about a stiff drink.   

195
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,360
        so they add water       
  to cut it down to about 50%,  

196
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,762
 and then it's ready to bottle. 

197
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,964
    to make a darker whiskey,   
          they steep it         

198
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,033
      with what looks like      
         a big tea bag.         

199
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,436
    it's actually wood chips    
    wrapped in cheesecloth.     

200
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,907
   the whiskey absorbs flavor   
     and color from the wood    

201
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,509
          over a period         
      of about two months.      

202
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,446
     when the whiskey takes     
        on a golden hue,        

203
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,915
        they transfer it        
        into oak barrels.       

204
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,388
  they allow the whiskey to age 
  for two years in a hot room.  

205
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,391
   the heat causes the whiskey  
           to expand,           

206
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,993
 causing it to absorb the flavor
          of the wood,          

207
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:26,063
 but the pressure can also cause
     cracks in the barrels,     

208
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,934
        so the brewmaster       
   routinely checks for leaks.  

209
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,006
   after the whiskey has aged,  

210
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:40,011
 they adjust the alcohol content
    by adding a little water.   

211
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,548
  the water is always softened  
 and filtered to remove minerals

212
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,017
        that could affect       
      the whiskey's taste.      

213
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,688
    at the bottling station,    

214
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,891
   machinery pumps the whiskey  
      into the containers.      

215
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,961
      there's no spillage,      
  and not a drop goes to waste. 

216
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:02,901
    machinery then twists on    
            the caps            

217
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,571
    for an airtight seal that   
 preserves the aroma and flavor 

218
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,574
      of this old-fashioned     
          corn whiskey.         

219
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,848
      at the next station,      
    robotic arms grab labels,   

220
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,619
    apply glue to them, then    
  press them onto the bottles.  

221
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,327
   it has taken a combination   

222
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,330
    of down-home methodology    
      and modern technology     

223
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,834
  to prepare this old-fashioned 
  american whiskey for market.  

224
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,205
 and whether it's aged or fresh,

225
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:44,376
  this historic whiskey is sure 
  to set the taste buds ablaze. 

226
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,027
      narrator: this clutch     
  is not for the family sedan.  

227
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,964
      it's a racing clutch      
       designed for a car       

228
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,633
with an 1,800-horsepower engine.

229
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,102
        without this kind       
      of heavy-duty clutch,     

230
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,971
      there would be no way     
           to transfer          

231
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,639
 that much power to the wheels, 

232
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,909
         and the racecar        
  would be going nowhere fast.  

233
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,649
          racecars use          
      a manual transmission     

234
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,717
to transfer power to the wheels,

235
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,788
        so a good clutch        
      is behind every win.      

236
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,325
        production starts       
        with a flywheel,        

237
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,261
    which connects the clutch   
         to the engine.         

238
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:40,064
   computerized cutting tools   
   shape this aluminum part,    

239
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,902
      then move on to carve     
 the cover plate for the clutch.

240
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,273
     they trim its perimeter    
 to give it the correct profile 

241
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,475
     and reduce its weight.     

242
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:01,019
      next they use a bolt      
 with an industrial diamond tip 

243
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,155
      to level the surface      
    of an iron friction disk.   

244
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,624
         this will allow        
       for better contact       

245
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,361
 with other parts of the clutch.

246
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,231
there are typically two to three
     of these friction disks    

247
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,034
       in a racing clutch.      

248
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,704
   the clutch disks will ride   
   against this steel insert,   

249
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,641
       which they position      
        on the flywheel.        

250
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,910
     the technician applies     
   locking compound to bolts,   

251
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,214
    then uses them to attach    
   the insert to the flywheel.  

252
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:38,623
    here, the technician sets   
 the bolts to a precise torque. 

253
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,998
    next he uses this grinder   

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,667
     to flatten the surface     
      of the steel insert,      

255
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,804
    again for better contact    
      with the clutch disk.     

256
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:57,876
   these bolts will anchor the  
clutch assembly to the flywheel.

257
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:01,479
   they're called stand bolts,  
       and there are six.       

258
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,620
       here, they sculpt        
       titanium cylinders       

259
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,556
 to act as stands for the bolts 

260
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,225
    that were just installed    
        in the flywheel.        

261
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,828
       titanium is strong       
        and lightweight,        

262
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,698
   which is important because   
  of the huge amount of energy  

263
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,766
    the clutch must transfer.   

264
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,576
      the technician places     
     a stand over each bolt,    

265
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,311
 then arranges the clutch disks 

266
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,381
       and a floater plate      
        on the flywheel.        

267
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,723
      he presets the height     
         of the stands.         

268
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,395
        then he prepares        
  the pressure-plate assembly.  

269
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,300
    he presses aluminum cups    
    into holes in the cover.    

270
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,472
  these cups will hold springs  

271
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,677
   that will be used to change  
the pressure of the clutch pack,

272
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,080
  but he holds off on inserting 
    the springs in the cups.    

273
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:13,284
   first he installs a series   
  of levers on the cover plate. 

274
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,688
      he slides pivot pins      
        into each lever.        

275
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,624
           these pins           
     will enable the levers     

276
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,161
   to compress and decompress   
        the clutch pack.        

277
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,567
he applies lubricant to adjuster
 screws for the clutch springs, 

278
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,371
      then threads each one     
    into an aluminum casing.    

279
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,441
     he inserts an assembly     
          in each cup,          

280
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,778
followed by a heavy-duty spring.

281
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,379
         he now installs        
        the pressure ring       

282
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,115
 on the underside of the cover. 

283
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,718
    when the driver releases    
        the clutch pedal,       

284
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,652
           the levers           
     cause the pressure ring    

285
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,855
  to compress the clutch pack.  

286
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:55,260
that action transfers power from
the engine to the transmission. 

287
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,265
 he now slips the pressure-ring 
 assembly over the stand bolts  

288
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,134
    and secures it with nuts.   

289
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,937
      he adjusts each stand     
      with a socket wrench,     

290
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,406
     then checks the height.    

291
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,145
   he measures the tips of the  
 levers to confirm they're even 

292
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:17,549
            and makes           
   any necessary adjustments.   

293
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,758
      he pushes the levers      
      to test this clutch,      

294
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,227
     and the pressure ring      
     responds as it should,     

295
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,697
 creating the necessary pressure
       on the clutch pack.      

296
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,899
finally, a certification sticker

297
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:39,037
 and some strapping to secure it
          for shipping.         

298
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:46,177
 at the track, this clutch will 
 be serviced between every run, 

299
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,580
      and if it's operating     
      at peak performance,      

300
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,716
         a win could be         
       just down the road.
