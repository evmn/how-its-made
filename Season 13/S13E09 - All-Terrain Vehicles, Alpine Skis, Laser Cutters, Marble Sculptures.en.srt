00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,853
narrator: for this invention,      

4
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,188
the path to success has been bumpy and rocky,   

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,857
and that's the whole idea.   

6
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,393
the all-terrain vehicle was developed for off-road driving 

7
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,662
back in the 1970s.       

8
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,930
the first machines were three-wheelers,      

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,466
and then the safer four-wheelers
came along,          

10
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,369
improving on a concept that was truly trailblazing.  

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,277
if you're looking for adventure,

12
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,013
an all-terrain vehicle will get you out of a rut.   

13
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,281
all that bouncing around won't hurt a bit        

14
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,283
because the independent rear suspension        

15
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,087
takes some of the shock out of that bumpy ride.    

16
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,160
to make an all-terrain vehicle,

17
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:38,030
they clamp pieces of the steel framework to a worktable.   

18
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,433
the table flips and lands in a precise position

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,969
for welding robots to go to work.         

20
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:48,106
these computerized robots do all the big welds.     

21
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,744
humans take over for the more intricate work.  

22
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,516
once the vehicle mainframe is complete,          

23
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,785
they hang it on an overhead rail,      

24
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,454
which takes it through a painting station.  

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,524
when the paint is dry, they lock it onto rails    

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,327
that will move it down the assembly line.    

27
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,797
they tie the radiator to it with hose.           

28
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,266
it will be attached more securely later.      

29
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,470
the steering axle for the front wheels goes in next. 

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,205
at the next station,      

31
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:23,209
they bolt the steel handlebars to the front of the vehicle.  

32
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,681
they hoist a 300cc engine into the chassis.       

33
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:32,251
it's suitable for beginners or smaller riders.       

34
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,324
they fit the carburetor into the engine manifold.   

35
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,630
moving down the line,     

36
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,833
they install the suspension system for the front wheels  

37
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:52,238
and run the brake lines to the brake disks.      

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,708
they brace the suspension with a steel bracket.     

39
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,110
the extra support will come in handy       

40
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,980
when this atv is on rough terrain.      

41
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,917
they push the outer exhaust pipe
onto one            

42
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,518
that extends from the engine  

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,788
and hook them together with springs.         

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,323
they then slide the front and rear clutches  

45
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,125
onto grooved shafts      

46
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,261
and connect them with a rubber belt       

47
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:18,597
to transmit power from the engine to the transmission.

48
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,465
the radiator          

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,068
has been permanently mounted to the chassis,        

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,605
and they bolt the coolant tank to the framework above it.   

51
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:33,879
the 4 1/2-gallon fuel tank goes 
between the handlebars and seat.

52
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,419
they insert the air-filter box in an opening behind the tank. 

53
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:45,491
this much bigger lid goes on the storage box in the front. 

54
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,694
and after a little trademark artwork,       

55
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,098
they push the instrumentation panel into place        

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,899
between the handlebars.    

57
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:59,772
footwells made of rigid plastic
flank each side of the atv.  

58
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,845
at the next station,      

59
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,581
they mount the front grille and headlights.        

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,718
they screw a rack onto the back.

61
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
it can be used to tie down anything      

62
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,990
from camping gear to game.   

63
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,192
workers then press a comfy vinyl seat       

64
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,663
onto the center of the vehicle,
snapping it into place.    

65
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,868
now this all-terrain vehicle is ready for its wheels.    

66
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,369
the back ones are larger    

67
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,005
to provide that cushioning effect over the bumps,     

68
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,007
while the smaller wheels in the front          

69
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,812
provide traction and maneuverability.      

70
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,681
they apply reflector decals to the sides and back,     

71
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,852
so the atv can be seen more easily when daylight dims.

72
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,756
the tank has been fueled,   

73
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:56,362
and this atv is ready to take a ride on the drum tester.   

74
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:59,832
the operator parks the wheels on a set of drums.       

75
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,499
he activates the computer,   

76
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,903
and those drums are ready to roll.       

77
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,706
the gate closes,        

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,643
and the atv rides on the spinning drums,     

79
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,512
reaching high speeds without actually moving.    

80
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,547
it's the perfect opportunity  

81
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:20,786
to test the gears, brakes, and exhaust system.      

82
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,657
the operator then gives the brakes a workout      

83
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,793
because good brakes are critical
in backwoods conditions.    

84
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,962
and it passes.         

85
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,733
from the three-wheel machine of the '70s          

86
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,202
to the flashy four-wheeler of today,           

87
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:41,240
the atv continues to be popular
off the beaten track.     

88
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,222
narrator: thousands of years ago,    

89
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,025
scandinavians strapped wooden planks on their feet  

90
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,559
to glide across snow.     

91
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,563
those first skis enabled them to hunt and trap in the winter.

92
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,499
essentially, they skied to live.

93
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,168
today, however, some of us live to ski,    

94
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,372
and cutting-edge equipment is part of the appeal.     

95
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,844
in the past century,      

96
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,647
downhill skis have become shorter and curvier      

97
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,249
for peak performance.     

98
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,453
they start with a squared-off ash log.  

99
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,922
a band saw slices it into several planks.      

100
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,058
ash is supple, but strong,   

101
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,997
which makes it an ideal wood for the core of a ski.     

102
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:40,733
a second blade thins each plank
at the end           

103
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:45,337
and widens it where the skier's foot sits.  

104
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,341
sanding establishes subtle angles on the edges.  

105
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,010
then the planks move along to a machine    

106
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,646
that cuts teeth into them.   

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,685
a ridged applicator applies epoxy glue       

108
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,754
to the toothy ends of two boards.         

109
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,292
machinery presses them together
for a tight fit.        

110
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,828
as the glue dries, it creates a permanent bond.  

111
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,631
the two planks are now one ski core.         

112
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,970
it still needs some fine-tuning,

113
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,238
so a robot positions it on a conveyor,         

114
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,608
which takes it under a sanding belt.     

115
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,780
it smooths the interlocked section    

116
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,515
and grinds deep cuts into the core.         

117
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,183
this defines the parabolic shape

118
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,586
that helps skiers carve through powder      

119
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,588
in short, clean turns.     

120
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:46,731
they silk-screen graphic artwork
and logos onto plastic.    

121
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,801
it's a bit of corporate p.r., 

122
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:54,472
but the flashy designs can also inspire the skier.  

123
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,210
an operator then brushes a release agent into a mold,  

124
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:03,082
as she prepares to build and shape several skis at a time. 

125
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,284
a little vacuuming gets rid of any dust      

126
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,386
that would sully the work.   

127
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,492
then she tucks pieces of graphite-fortified polyethylene

128
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,561
into the mold.         

129
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:20,566
it will form the base of the skis.          

130
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,968
she places rubber on the ends 

131
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,171
to minimize vibrations while skiing.         

132
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,040
next come layers of special fiberglass     

133
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,243
that run the length of each ski.

134
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,046
this material is both flexible and durable. 

135
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,715
it's been formulated specifically for skis.     

136
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,184
the weave varies from layer to layer,      

137
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,187
depending on the type of ski. 

138
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,990
strips of rubber reinforce the back ends,    

139
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,327
followed by pieces of heavy-duty polyurethane.  

140
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,999
the assembler places the curved wooden cores    

141
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,202
on top of the synthetic layers.

142
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,538
she installs melamine     
to build up the ski's sidewalls.

143
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,141
this improves gripping in hard snow.         

144
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,611
to provide a firm base for bindings,         

145
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,082
she covers the narrow waist  
of the ski with more fiberglass,

146
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,749
followed by an aluminum plate 

147
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,821
to hold the binding screws in the ski.          

148
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,490
more layers of fiberglass follow,     

149
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:22,494
imbued with epoxy glue, which is about to be activated.

150
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:32,838
once the colorful top sheet is secured,          

151
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,572
they close the mold.      

152
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,843
inside, the temperature reaches
212 degrees fahrenheit.    

153
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:43,182
this causes the glue impregnated
in the fiberglass to liquefy, 

154
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,650
while the mold squeezes the layers           

155
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,319
into the shape of the ski.   

156
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,389
when the glue hardens,     

157
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,258
the many layers become one solid ski.     

158
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,599
it's a fusion of synthetic, wood, and metal. 

159
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,735
but it's still a bit rough around the edges,       

160
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,938
so this robot smooths the tip and tail of the ski  

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,674
against a sanding belt.    

162
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,546
the ski then travels over several grinding wheels. 

163
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,948
this cleans it up and creates angles       

164
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,817
for precision carving on the slopes.         

165
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,553
then, like a powerful fist,  

166
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,890
this machine tests its flexibility and strength. 

167
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,828
finally, a worker screws a rail system 

168
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,163
to the waist of the ski    

169
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:35,067
to make it easier for the ski shop to install bindings.   

170
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,904
then it's all downhill from here,           

171
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:42,541
which, of course, is the whole idea.       

172
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,526
narrator: a laser cutter is a high-tech machine     

173
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,195
that factories use to cut parts out of metal.   

174
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:06,331
the traditional way to cut metal
is with a stamping press,   

175
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,666
a slower process        

176
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,669
that requires a separate tool for each type of cut.     

177
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,138
a laser cutter's computer-guided beam      

178
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,474
can precision-cut virtually any shape.      

179
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,881
a laser cutter is made up of a laser resonator,     

180
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,484
which produces the beam,    

181
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,419
and a mechanical system that moves the laser over the metal 

182
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,689
in a computer-controlled pattern.            

183
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,427
to build the laser resonator, 

184
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,830
they mill two blocks of aluminum.          

185
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,634
each will hold a mirror on opposite ends of the resonator.

186
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,903
they will reflect light back and forth inside the chamber  

187
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,640
to form the laser beam.    

188
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,242
all the parts go into a cleaning solution  

189
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,613
because any contaminants would shorten the laser's life.   

190
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,985
assembly takes place in a clean room.        

191
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,656
after mounting the aluminum blocks onto separate aluminum tubes, 

192
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,125
they slide one tube inside the other.       

193
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,596
this forms the resonator's main structure.        

194
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,903
they install an electrical connector on one of the blocks.

195
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,408
then they mount a mirror onto each aluminum block.   

196
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,744
a generator pumps electrical energy    

197
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,213
into a pressurized mixture of gasses,           

198
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,950
producing particles of light called photons.        

199
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,152
the mirrors at both ends of the resonator        

200
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,955
direct the photons back and forth,        

201
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,757
creating the laser beam.    

202
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,561
they now fill the resonator with that pressurized gas.   

203
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:47,299
it's a mixture of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium.  

204
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,705
for the laser beam to cut well,
it has to be the right shape, 

205
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,306
but the beam is invisible.   

206
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,975
so, to see its shape,     

207
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,244
they have to shoot it into a plastic cube      

208
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,047
and observe the formation it makes.           

209
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,850
they gradually fine-tune the beam's shape        

210
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,654
by adjusting the mirrors on the resonator.       

211
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,925
they keep at it until the laser
cuts a cone formation     

212
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,360
in the plastic.        

213
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,798
on top of the tubes,      

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,001
they install a square housing containing a series of mirrors,

215
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,538
which further refine the beam. 

216
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,142
meanwhile, a robotic welder fuses sheets of steel     

217
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:33,412
to construct the laser resonator's housing. 

218
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,353
on the main machine,      

219
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,755
these large suction cups move the sheet of metal     

220
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,490
to the cutting area.      

221
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,626
the sheet remains stationary, 

222
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,228
while a motion unit moves the laser beam over it. 

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,535
a rack-and-pinion system propels the motion unit.    

224
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,972
the system's racks must be perfectly aligned   

225
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,308
for the machine to cut accurately,       

226
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,044
so a technician uses precision measuring equipment 

227
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,579
to check the racks,      

228
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,782
then various tools to make adjustments.      

229
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,250
once that's done,       

230
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:16,654
they set up the guide rails on which the motion unit rides,

231
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,291
then mount the motion unit onto them.           

232
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:29,067
they bolt the motion unit to the front of the machine  

233
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,736
and the housing that contains the laser resonator      

234
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,605
to the back of the machine.  

235
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,208
the resonator creates the laser beam.    

236
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,944
mirrors deliver it to the motion unit's cutting head.

237
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,214
lenses inside the head focus the beam         

238
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:45,750
on the metal that's underneath.

239
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,220
they run a series of tests   

240
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:52,824
to ensure the machine cuts with ultimate precision.    

241
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:56,094
it all boils down to whether the
motion unit moves accurately, 

242
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:01,566
which means the drive-system  
racks must be perfectly aligned.

243
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,834
after testing,         

244
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,837
they enclose the cutting head with a safety cover      

245
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,842
made of sheet metal and plexiglas.         

246
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:14,312
the cutting head's copper-tipped
nozzle emits the laser beam,  

247
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,848
while a curtain of brass pins confines that beam       

248
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,784
to a restricted area.     

249
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,520
the motion unit moves in three axes,      

250
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,257
enabling the laser beam to cut different thicknesses  

251
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,993
in two dimensions.       

252
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,530
a stamping machine leaves rough edges       

253
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,865
that workers must grind smooth afterward,  

254
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,068
but a laser cutter leaves a smooth edge      

255
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,337
that needs no further work.  

256
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,273
this saves on time and labor cost,    

257
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,677
making this technology a cut above.          

258
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,030
narrator: it was michelangelo who once said,         

259
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,032
"every block of stone has a statue inside it,    

260
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,035
and it is the task       
of the sculptor to discover it."

261
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,639
centuries later, sculptors still chisel by those words,  

262
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,841
using techniques similar to those used         

263
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,245
by the brilliant michelangelo so many years ago.       

264
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,052
a lifelike image emerges from stone,      

265
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,787
and that well-chiseled look  

266
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:31,823
is the result         
of a lot of planning and posing.

267
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,663
the artist first molds the subject in clay,      

268
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,601
which allows him to capture his impressions quickly.    

269
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,072
his clay model is the sculpture equivalent    

270
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,339
of a painter's sketch.     

271
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,008
clay also allows him to make changes        

272
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,212
that would be impossible once carved in stone.     

273
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,352
when the prototype is complete,

274
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,955
the artist is ready to choose a stone.       

275
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,761
the search leads to this quarry
in the hills of northern italy,

276
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,230
where they've been extracting white carrara marble      

277
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,832
for centuries.         

278
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,504
a long saw on a track makes a horizontal incision  

279
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,506
in the bottom of the rock face.

280
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,645
once this undercut is complete,

281
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,447
the operation moves to the top of the stone.    

282
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,717
a machine pulls a loop of diamond cable    

283
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,654
down through the rock to cut the back of the slab.  

284
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:47,665
a constant spray of water cools
the cable and flushes the cut. 

285
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,801
when the two cuts intersect,  

286
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:53,405
this marble slab is ready to be extracted.   

287
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,809
equipment gently tips it    
onto a soft pile of dirt intact.

288
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,152
the supervisor gives the slab a production number      

289
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,420
and draws lines to indicate how it should be cut      

290
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,123
to prepare it for sculpting.  

291
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,560
once cut down to size, it's into the studio,      

292
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,228
where it's positioned     

293
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,165
beside a plaster version of a clay model.        

294
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,570
with calipers,         

295
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,240
an artisan measures the proportions of the plaster cast

296
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,578
and transfers them to the marble slab.      

297
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,381
his pencil marks define the main mass and outer limits 

298
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,316
of the form that's to be sculpted.     

299
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,258
this artist chips away big chunks of the stone    

300
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,695
to give the rough size and shape
of the plaster model.     

301
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
the penciled measurements ensure

302
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,738
that he doesn't chip away too much and destroy the slab. 

303
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,275
once the general shape has been achieved,       

304
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,745
it's time for the detail work. 

305
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,882
the sculptor measures the plaster prototype     

306
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,884
with a tool called a pointing machine.      

307
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,286
he transfers the measurements to the marble sculpture,    

308
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,890
ensuring that all the details will be to the correct scale. 

309
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,762
of course, pointing tools   

310
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,632
can only show the artist <i> where</i> to carve --       

311
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,834
there's no substitute for skill.

312
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,502
with a pneumatic chisel,    

313
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,439
the artist shapes the foot of the figure.    

314
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,714
next, the artist switches to a series of rasps and files,

315
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,782
so he can shape the smaller details      

316
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,685
and eliminate any chisel marks.

317
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,190
the fingers require a gentle approach.       

318
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,927
they're delicate and could be broken easily.  

319
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,999
it takes about four months for a sculpture        

320
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:04,068
to go from the rough form to the finished.        

321
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,404
and now for the final touches --

322
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,340
he rubs oxalic acid into the marble.        

323
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,610
this seals it and protects it from stains,  

324
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,081
but also gives the sculpture a polished look.        

325
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,254
the result is a translucent effect      

326
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,423
that gives the sculpture visual depth.         

327
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,627
like ghosts in the attic,   

328
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,163
there's an incredible array of plaster casts        

329
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,032
on this studio's upper floor. 

330
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,969
many of them are replicas of famous classical works.   

331
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:41,439
they're all on standby to serve as prototypes     

332
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,708
for sculptural reproductions. 

333
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,047
and once these images are carved in stone,      

334
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,950
they should live on forever.  

335
