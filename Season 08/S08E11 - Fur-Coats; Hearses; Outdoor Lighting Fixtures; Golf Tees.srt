00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,424
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,193
          fur coats...          

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,899
          ...hearses...         

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,572
 ...outdoor lighting fixtures...

7
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,545
        ...and golf tees.       

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,321
   fur coats have been around   
     through thick and thin.    

9
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,922
   they used to be very bulky,  

10
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,059
       but today's garment      
         is much thinner        

11
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,061
         because of new         
    manufacturing techniques.   

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,932
  the new lightweight fur coats 
are also cut closer to the body,

13
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,935
     but they still provide     
     old-fashioned warmth.      

14
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,881
    today fur coats are made    
      for a changing market     

15
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,684
      that values less bulk     
        and more texture.       

16
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,357
  the beaver pelt now undergoes 
    multiple transformations    

17
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,594
 until it doesn't even resemble 
       the original pelt.       

18
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,201
       they steam the fur       
         to fluff it up.        

19
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,972
        then they give it       
         a static charge        

20
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,208
 to make the hair stand on end. 

21
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,714
 the pelt then goes under a row 
 of little blades several times.

22
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,049
       this shears the fur      

23
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,152
    so the hairs are uniform    
    and the pelt less bulky.    

24
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,590
 but because the downy undercoat
  is the most insulating part,  

25
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,793
  this fur will still be warm.  

26
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,931
   grooving is a new technique  

27
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,668
 that involves carving a pattern
       into the dyed fur.       

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,872
 the blades cut a zigzag pattern
   down the length of the fur,  

29
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,908
     giving the beaver pelt     
     a unique look and feel.    

30
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:40,291
  now the furrier demonstrates  
  a process called letting out. 

31
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,293
  he feeds a pelt to a machine  

32
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,763
         that slices it         
     into diagonal ribbons.     

33
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,565
 yes, he's cutting it to shreds,

34
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,834
      but when this process     
          is complete,          

35
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,903
          they'll have          
     a new and improved fur.    

36
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,773
  they sew the diagonal strips  
            together,           

37
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,110
  arranging each a little lower 
         than the last.         

38
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,979
       they use a special       
       fur-sewing machine.      

39
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,248
         as the operator        
        feeds the strips,       

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,716
     he pushes the fur down     

41
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,053
    so it doesn't get caught    
 in the seam and ruin the look. 

42
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,023
 it's something that takes skill
         and experience.        

43
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,605
the narrow strips of fur created
   by this letting-out process  

44
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,807
    will run the full length    
           of a coat.           

45
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,209
    it's a more flowing look    

46
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,677
       than simply sewing       
      whole pelts together,     

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,146
    but it also makes the fur   
         a bit rippled.         

48
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,150
    a process called blocking   
       will correct that.       

49
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,952
    they wet down the leather   
          of the pelt.          

50
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,622
    then they split it a bit    
  at the end to fit the pattern 

51
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,124
       that's been traced       
    onto a board underneath.    

52
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,129
       they staple the fur      
        onto the pattern.       

53
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,774
     after leaving it to dry    
           overnight,           

54
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,243
 they trace the original pattern

55
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,044
      onto the leather side     
           of the fur,          

56
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,913
        now smoothed out        
      from the stretching.      

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,783
  they mark a spot for a pocket 

58
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:16,321
and trim the fur to the pattern 
so the dimensions are now exact.

59
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,339
      specialized finishers     

60
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,075
       sew a cloth pocket       
 into the slit prepared for it. 

61
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,413
    they stitch in the zipper   

62
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,883
 and then cut out pieces of silk
        to line the coat.       

63
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,095
 before they sew in that lining,

64
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,497
  they build up the front edges 
         of the garment         

65
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,500
     by tacking lamb's wool     
     on the inside edging.      

66
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,570
     this will add structure    
 and help the fur hold its form 

67
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,506
  as they put it in the lining. 

68
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,512
starch-cotton tape now goes into
       the hem of the coat      

69
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,613
to keep the fur from stretching.

70
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,582
        handcraftsmanship       
         has always been        

71
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,651
          a key element         
      of the fur industry.      

72
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,188
      every fur gets these      
hand-stitched finishing touches.

73
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,070
     once the label goes on,    

74
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,341
     this fur coat is ready     
    for a night on the town.    

75
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,692
            narrator:           
   we all have to go sometime,  
     and when it's our time,    

76
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,230
 a hearse will likely be waiting
    to take us away in style.   

77
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,098
  hearses are all about luxury, 

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,901
   because luxury says dignity  
          and respect.          

79
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,569
 from the plush custom interior 

80
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,838
        to the stretched        
     and streamlined design,    

81
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,309
    it's nothing but the best   
    for our dearly departed.    

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,454
     it's the final journey,    

83
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,123
 and the vehicle is custom-made 
        for the occasion.       

84
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,793
           they start           
    with a cadillac chassis.    

85
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,462
     it's been built without    
    rear doors, rear windows,   

86
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,532
        backseats, trunk,       
         or rear bumper.        

87
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,268
            they park           
     in a master-framer jig     

88
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,403
and immediately slice it in two,

89
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,940
 using a reciprocating saw that 
 cuts through metal like butter.

90
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,280
  the jig allows the two halves 
       to be pulled apart       

91
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,150
 so there's just under 31 inches
          between them.         

92
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,056
      then they weld rails      
     to join the two halves.    

93
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,765
 they encase each new frame rail
      with a support piece.     

94
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,768
   the framework for a hearse   
   has to be extremely solid    

95
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,304
      because it will carry     
   heavy loads for many years.  

96
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,172
   the base cadillac also has   

97
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,108
 more structural reinforcements 
     than a regular vehicle,    

98
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,977
      like stronger wheels      
         and suspension.        

99
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,990
 they hoist the steel rear cage 
  and roof frame onto the car,  

100
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,927
   and they build up the roof   
        with steel rails.       

101
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,999
          the framework         
   for the casket-loading door  

102
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,601
          goes on next.         

103
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,345
 once the rear cage and chassis 
   extensions are in position,  

104
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,147
     they mount the panels,     
    which are made of a blend   

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,283
          of fiberglass         
    and space-age materials.    

106
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,021
    adhesive seals the panels   
    to the steel skeleton...    

107
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,963
     ...and they secure all     
the panels in place with screws.

108
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,774
 this is a made-to-measure job. 

109
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,744
    the panels precisely fit    
       to the welded cage.      

110
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,188
           meanwhile,           
     over in the press room,    

111
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,858
  they roll a nonstick coating  
           onto a die,          

112
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,595
   then place a sheet of steel  
            over it.            

113
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,032
    they also give the steel    
  a coat of the nonstick agent. 

114
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:04,475
  an 850-ton press then pushes  
     the steel into the die     

115
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,745
        to shape the door       
      of the funeral coach.     

116
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,751
the nonstick coating allows them
    to remove the door easily   

117
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,819
      without damaging it.      

118
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,956
      they attach the door      
    to the back of the hearse   

119
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,557
    using superstrong hinges    

120
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,727
because they'll have to stand up
        to a lot of wear.       

121
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,565
   this door is high and wide   

122
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,735
 and opens 135 degrees to allow 
 for easy loading of the casket.

123
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,705
       after smoothing out      
      the seams in the body     

124
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,508
          and giving it         
     a high-gloss paint job,    

125
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,044
       they cover the roof      
        with a foam pad.        

126
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,717
    they place vinyl material   
             over it            

127
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,220
       and pull it snugly       
       around the corners.      

128
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,872
they line the deck of the hearse
   with a heavy-duty laminate.  

129
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,879
next they put up the head liner,

130
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,816
     the fabric that covers     
   the ceiling of the hearse.   

131
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,822
     they mount the hardware    
   that will allow the casket   

132
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,358
    to easily roll in and out   
          of the coach.         

133
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,000
            finally,            
    the "custom built" sign.    

134
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,238
   from the lustrous paint job  
to the lush, curtained interior,

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,708
        the funeral coach       
     has an ethereal look --    

136
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,310
 appropriate since it's designed

137
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,648
         to make an exit        
    that's out of this world.   

138
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,866
     narrator: day or night,    
streetlights light up our lives.

139
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,604
   typically standing as high   
 as 26 feet above the sidewalk, 

140
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,072
      they cast a warm glow     
         in the darkness        

141
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,376
     and continue to provide    
  street decor during the day.  

142
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,022
          this fixture,         
       called a luminaire,      

143
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,358
 starts as a technical drawing. 

144
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,495
      to make certain parts     
        of the luminaire,       

145
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,365
   the factory uses a process   
      called sand-casting.      

146
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,568
 to create the internal features
        of the sand mold,       

147
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,771
   workers take a wooden mold   
          for the part          

148
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,340
   and fill it with a mixture   
       made of white sand.      

149
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,152
     they insert a wire into    
the center to make an opening...

150
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,524
  ...then inject carbon dioxide 
        into the opening.       

151
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,861
 this causes a chemical reaction
     that hardens the sand.     

152
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,001
   they remove the white-sand   
     piece, called the core,    

153
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,970
      from the wooden mold.     

154
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,076
   to cast the external parts   
        of the luminaire,       

155
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,745
    workers start with a mold   
        made of aluminum.       

156
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,749
  inside it, they build another 
    mold made of brown soil.    

157
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:46,831
 they place a wood block on top 
     and pack down the soil.    

158
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,068
        they do the same        
 on the other half of the mold. 

159
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,244
    now, with a copper pipe,    

160
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,313
         they make holes        
       in the soil mold --      

161
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,449
     one in which they pour     
        molten aluminum,        

162
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,517
     the other to vent air.     

163
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,653
      they spray the inside     
       with compressed air      

164
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,791
         so no particles        
  will stick to the cast piece. 

165
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,132
     they position the core     
       into the soil mold.      

166
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,869
      keys in the soil mold     
 help them position it exactly. 

167
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:35,012
 then they pour molten aluminum 
         into the mold.         

168
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,482
   aluminum is an ideal metal   
        for streetlights        

169
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,951
    because it's lightweight,   
         rust-resistant,        

170
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,953
       and it won't stick       
       to the soil mold.        

171
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,628
   after two to five minutes,   

172
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,231
    they open the metal frame   
      and shatter the mold.     

173
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,166
 they use a drill to remove the 
        white sand piece        

174
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,303
         from the inside        
   of the cast-aluminum part.   

175
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,142
  next they sand down the part  
       to make it smooth.       

176
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,448
        automated drills        
     then pierce pilot holes    

177
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,550
      for various hardware.     

178
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,325
    a welder places a bracket   
           in a vise,           

179
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,228
  then welds a decorative tube  
            onto it.            

180
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,650
  next he welds an anchor plate 
          onto a pole.          

181
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:53,024
  the upper part of the pole is 
 welded to a larger bottom part.

182
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,308
    all the poles, brackets,    
       and luminaire parts      

183
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,310
        go into a series        
        of chemical baths       

184
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,379
  to prepare them for painting. 

185
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,650
      the model shown here      

186
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,853
    comes with tempered-glass   
 or polycarbonate lens finishes 

187
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,990
       on all four sides.       

188
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,392
          they install          
      the lighting system.      

189
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,729
       first they position      
 the bowl-shaped aluminum piece.

190
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,531
 then the lamp socket is mounted
 with the electrical components 

191
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,034
    inside the aluminum bowl.   

192
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,405
finally they install a reflector
         inside the hood        

193
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,674
      to project the light      
       toward the street.       

194
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,478
 they apply labels with product 
   and maintenance information  

195
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,113
    into the fixture's hood.    

196
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,417
      now they can close up     
          the luminaire         

197
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,420
          and mount it          
      on a pole or bracket.     

198
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,424
     and let there be light.    

199
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,702
            narrator:           
before golf tees became popular,

200
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,039
 players would tee up their ball
   on a little mound of sand.   

201
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,774
    the first peg-style tees    

202
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,843
          were invented         
    more than a century ago,    

203
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,712
 but they didn't really catch on
        until the 1920s,        

204
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,382
        when one company        
   marketed them aggressively,  

205
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,051
   using professional golfers   
        to promote them.        

206
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,861
    that wooden peg you stick   
 in the ground to hold the ball 

207
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,530
     is almost as important     
       as your golf club.       

208
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,066
          you use a tee         
on the first stroke of each hole

209
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,235
     to give your drive shot    
         extra distance.        

210
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:49,206
at the sawmill, white birch logs
  are scaled at the small end.  

211
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,644
  just one 8-inch diameter log  
yields close to 3,000 golf tees.

212
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,416
        the logs go into        
  what's called a step feeder.  

213
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,552
  this conveyor transports them 
     to a debarking machine.    

214
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:05,089
   then a slasher saws the log  
      into shorter lengths.     

215
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,825
        the thumper roll,       
   a roller with steel teeth,   

216
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,761
        secures each log        
        to a sharp chain.       

217
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,265
   this holds the log in place  
    as it heads for the saws.   

218
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,006
   four saws work their magic,  

219
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,309
  carving the 4-1/2-foot boards 
   into shorter dowel boards,   

220
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,145
    each measuring 18 inches.   

221
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,655
     then a series of chains    

222
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,724
    lay down the dowel boards   
        in a single file        

223
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,093
        on what's called        
     a molder-and-feed roll.    

224
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,598
 the molder's two rotating heads

225
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,868
 transform the rectangular board
       into round dowels.       

226
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,278
         an outfeed roll        
  drops each dowel onto a belt  

227
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,880
           for several          
     quality-control checks.    

228
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,155
          an inspector          
      examines the dowels,      

229
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,557
    removing defective pieces   

230
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,426
    and setting aside dowels    
    that need more cutting.     

231
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,864
    a single inspector sorts    
close to 19,000 dowels per hour.

232
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,503
       they go into racks       
  that hold 8,900 dowels each.  

233
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,441
         rack after rack        
    now travels into a lathe.   

234
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:39,317
   a blade whittles the dowel   
     to a preliminary shape.    

235
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,193
  this tool, called a trumpet,  
     moves over the dowels,     

236
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,661
sculpting the tee's final shape.

237
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,200
     a blade simultaneously     
  slices the tee from the dowel 

238
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,469
       and forms the cup.       

239
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,609
       the metamorphosis        
       is almost complete       

240
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,411
      from wooden boards...     

241
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,413
          to dowels...          

242
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,482
            to tees.            

243
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,167
  next the tees go for a tumble 
       in a sanding drum.       

244
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,501
      this cascading action     

245
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,104
          has the tees          
  sanding each other's surface  

246
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,705
      until they're smooth.     

247
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,313
    the slots on this machine   

248
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,583
     separate the good tees     
        from the bad ones       

249
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,651
    and screen out the waste.   

250
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,389
      long, nail-like bumps     
 on the machine divide the tees 

251
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,058
   so that only one drops down  
           at a time.           

252
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,594
      the tee fits through      
 only if it's perfectly shaped. 

253
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,165
  the rejects and wood shavings 
       roll across the top      

254
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,867
       and land elsewhere.      

255
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,903
the good tees land in a big bin,
         called a tote.         

256
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,008
        golf tees come in       
    a few different lengths,    

257
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,477
      but your average one      
      is 2 1/2 inches long      

258
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,013
      and weighs .02 grams,     

259
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,483
    so a tote typically holds   
       some 100,000 tees.       

260
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,086
    a tote dumper then dumps    
        two totes of tees       

261
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,687
       into a paint drum.       

262
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,223
       small steel flights      
         inside the drum        

263
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,293
     send the tees cascading    
     in a uniform direction.    

264
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,829
         with each turn,        
       they pick up paint.      

265
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,032
 it takes 2 hours and 10 gallons
      of water-based paint      

266
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,702
     to fully coat the tees,    

267
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:41,372
     then another two hours     
        to dry the paint.       

268
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,708
  a trapdoor releases the tees  
    into a vibrating conveyor   

269
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,010
        and into a tote.        

270
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,247
          if these tees         
   will have printing on them,  

271
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,249
  there's still one more step.  

272
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,318
     they get an extra coat     
         of enamel paint        

273
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,520
   to create a smooth surface   
          for the ink.          

274
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,189
 shiny or mat, plain or printed,

275
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,325
          the golf tee          
    has sure come a long way    

276
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,929
  since the days of teeing off  
       on a mound of sand.      

277
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,006
