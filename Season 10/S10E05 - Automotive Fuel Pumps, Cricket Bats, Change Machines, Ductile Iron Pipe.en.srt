  when you start your car, it   
     activates a pump that's    
             usually  located i 

6
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:04,664
 this electrical system pushes  
   the gas out of the tank and  
              into              
   injectors, which aerate the  

7
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,601
  and deliver it to the engine  
           cylinders. without a 

8
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:19,545
   flowing, your car would be   
              going             
         nowhere fast.          
      you might think that   su 

9
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:24,683
  an electric pump in gasoline  
  would be a risky thing, but   

10
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:32,357
    it's actually a very safe   
              place             
             to be.   productio 

11
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,695
       pumping mechanism.       
 a gear and several rollers are 

12
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:41,367
            plates.             
   the rollers will rotate to   
              pull    fuel into 

13
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:51,844
  pushing it out of the tank.   
 each roller assembly is tested 
     by spinning it from the    

14
00:01:51,846 --> 00:02:01,520
  a robot then pops it out and  
 moves it to the next station.  

15
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:06,125
 attached to the roller pumping 
           mechanism. then it g 

16
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:13,065
       and a plastic cap.       
 all the parts that make up the 
   pumping mechanism have now   

17
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:21,740
           assembled.           
  next comes an end cap with a  

18
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:32,284
 a metal sleeve slides over the 
 pump unit, and the whole thing 

19
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:40,693
   inside this chamber, large   
 magnets generate a very strong 

20
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:45,964
  this causes the metal sleeve  
               to               
  collapse, crimping at one end 
               so    that it ho 

21
00:02:45,966 --> 00:03:01,914
           together.            
  next, retainer rings go into  

22
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:06,919
 a metal bracket goes over the  
             pump.  it steadies 

23
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:12,257
  serves as a guide as workers  
 install the brushes and coils  
  which will supply electricity 

24
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:19,331
      the fuel-pump motor.      
  a brass terminal slides onto  
               the   end of eac 

25
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:26,338
   assembly to facilitate the   
     electrical connection.     
     then the terminals are     

26
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:38,083
        to the assembly.        
 when the job is done, a robot  

27
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:48,226
 they built this fuel pump from 
  the inside out, and now the   

28
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:53,365
  inspectors hook each pump up  
               to               
  a power source and run fluid  
    through them to test the    

29
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:59,571
            action.             
   then they check for proper   
              flow  and pressur 

30
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,577
       if the pump passes       
         inspection, a          
     robot sends it down the    
            assembly line...    

31
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:11,583
 where a tubing system is being 
     assembled to carry the     
            gasoline to the eng 

32
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:21,326
  the joints are sealed with a  
         brazing paste.         
   then it's into a gas oven, w 

33
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:31,203
 the paste hardens and fuses to 
          the tubing. workers r 

34
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:36,142
   the oven and brush off any   
   unwanted bits of metal and h 

35
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:48,621
 the ends of the apparatus are  
    capped to keep them from    

36
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:57,429
        during shipping.        
  rubber tubing is attached to  
               the   pump and s 

37
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:04,369
            clamps.             
   then the rubber tubing is    

38
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:14,513
            system.             
   workers wire the fuel pump,

   this is the sending unit.  i 

40
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:26,992
      that's attached to an     
           electronic           
            sensor.  the sensor 

41
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:33,866
 about fuel levels to the fuel  
    gauge on the dashboard.     
  a computerized system checks  

42
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:44,677
 sending unit's accuracy as the 
  sensor is moved up and down.  
   once everything checks out,  

43
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:52,951
 time to fill the tank and hit  
           the road.   up next  

44
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,555
  we'll go behind the scenes at

 >> narrator: references to the 
  game of cricket date back to  
               the 1300s.       

46
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:12,304
  historians believe it started 
               as               
       a children's game. in th

00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:23,982
  by the 18th century, cricket  
               was              
   one of england's favorite    

49
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,786
   cricket bats are made of a   
  particular species of white w 

50
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:33,191
   it has stringy wood fibers   
              that              
       are usually long.        
       these give the wood  ela 

51
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:38,864
  the key to its performance.   
 bat makers use as much sapwood 
    as possible because it's    

52
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:46,338
   and more flexible than the   
 heartwood at the tree's core.  

53
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,277
 pieces about 2 1/2 feet long.  
  the first machine trims them  

54
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,216
  a few sprays of water limber  
               up               
        the wood fibers. then e

     three tons of pressure,    
            rounding            
 the bat's face and compressing 
   the wood by almost half an i 

57
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:16,769
 this pressing is essential to  
   the bat's performance and    

58
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:20,705
  the bat maker draws a "v" on  
               the              
   end where the handle will at 

59
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:26,845
   then he removes the bulk of  
              wood              
 behind the "v" on a table saw. 

60
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:39,458
 work he'll have to do by hand  
             later.    now he c 

61
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,731
  this creates a joint in which 
               to               
       insert the handle.   the 

62
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:51,336
     dried vine stems, glued    
            together            
  in sections, and coated with  

63
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:56,342
  the grip end has been shaped  
               on               
            a lathe.            
  the other end will attach to  

64
00:07:56,344 --> 00:08:01,213
             blade.             
     the bat maker cuts the  bl 

65
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:06,351
   that will fit into the "v"   
              cut,              
   then glues the two pieces    

66
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:21,700
    a few taps with a hammer    
             ensures            
          a tight fit. he sprea 

67
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:28,506
   over the joint to seal it.   
     now he shapes the bat's    
             profile            
   using a classic woodworking  

68
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:34,245
      called a drawknife.       
 this takes only a few minutes  
      but requires years of   e 

69
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:40,585
       and an expert eye.       
 then he completes the shaping  

70
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:45,990
  the bottom third of the bat.  
  international cricket rules   
  regulate the length and width 

71
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:50,863
      bats, but there's no      
           restriction          
           on curve.   getting  

72
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,399
            though.             
    too much curve, and he'll   
              limit   the blade 

73
00:08:54,401 --> 00:09:07,279
          performance.          
 the bat maker finishes off the 

74
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:14,753
    then he uses a metal hand   
              plane             
 to flatten the blade's edges.  

75
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:19,558
  spring by hitting it with a   
      dense wooden mallet.  he  

76
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,295
          the strike.           
    the softer the sound, the   
             softer             
  the wood, and the better the  

77
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:30,769
           will play.           
 he smooths the bat against an  

78
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:37,643
 molds to the bat so it doesn't 
  wear away the shape he worked 
               so    hard to ac 

79
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:42,781
 then a worker smooths out the  
   rest of the surface with a   
              belt              
  sander designed specifically  

80
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:48,319
         cricket bats.          
    the entire bat is sanded    
             twice,  first with 

81
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:54,326
     then with a fine one.      
 next, the bat is mounted on a  

82
00:09:54,328 --> 00:10:00,132
  handle gets a coat of glue.   
   a wrapping of twine binds  t 

83
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,333
   that make up the handle.     

84
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:17,349
 extra glue prevents the twine  
        from unraveling.   next

00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,618
     using a cotton wheel.      

86
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:38,904
 once the wood is shiny enough, 
    brand-name decals go on.    
   finally, a rubber grip goes  

87
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:44,442
   the binding to prevent the   
 player's hands from slipping.  

88
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,980
   complement each other when   
       striking the ball.  the

        it's like magic.  in go

 but behind the scenes, there's 

96
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:49,508
   innovative design and some   
  pretty high-tech equipment.

             panels.  the machi 

101
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:26,144
    a die, bending the edge.    
      these bent edges will     
           strengthen           
    the door and help it fit sn 

102
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:34,553
        into the frame.         
 the laser cutter also makes a  

103
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:40,158
         cabinet part.          
  then workers press threaded   

104
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,033
       a vibrating feeder       
          automatically         
  dispenses the studs into the  

105
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:53,505
 now they bend the sheet, again 
 using a press break, and make  
   the three-sided panel that   

106
00:12:53,507 --> 00:13:01,980
  become the cabinet sides and  
             back. they attach  

107
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:09,721
            panels.             
 then they position the cabinet 

108
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:18,330
 station and rotate the table.  
 a robot makes precision welds  

109
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:26,804
 shields workers from heat and  
         harmful rays.  now the 

110
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:32,010
   machine's coin dispenser.    
  it has two counter-rotating   
  discs fitted to the diameter  

111
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:37,415
      thickness of a coin.      
   they work together to seize  
               and              
   align the coins, then drop   

112
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:42,954
      into the coin chute.      
   workers set in these metal   
   discs, along with a plastic  

113
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:51,229
  mechanism that rotates them.  
  then they secure the parts on 
                a   fixture...  

114
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,033
 and drill holes into the gear  
          mechanism.            

115
00:13:55,035 --> 00:14:09,314
 roll pins are inserted to hold 
      the parts together.       
   then workers make sure the   

116
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:18,724
       discs spin freely.       
  the next task is to assemble  
               the              
    coin-dispenser discs and ge 

117
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:27,799
    this is precision work.     
 first, they set the parts in a 

118
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:38,410
  plastic rings go around the   
 discs to guide and support the 

119
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:43,281
      then they attach the      
           gear-train           
     motor which powers the     

120
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:59,764
 a plastic guide on the casing  
    helps the coins drop in     

121
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:05,303
 next comes the coin chute that 
  guides the change out of the  
     dispenser and into the   m 

122
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:14,111
           coin cup.            
    the dispenser holds up to   
              $800,   which can 

123
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:18,917
  pounds, so it needs a strong  
            handle.             
   it's locked into place with  

124
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:30,262
 tool, called a ring fastener.  
 now it's time to put the whole 

125
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:35,467
    first, an electric power    
             supply             
   is installed on the inside   
              back  wall.       

126
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:47,012
 next comes the bill validator. 
       and the coin cup.   then 

127
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:52,350
 electronic control board, the  
   brains of the machine that c 

128
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:58,022
 finally, on go the instruction 
            decals.             
   so, how do bills transform   

129
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:02,894
             coins?             
  let's open the door and see.  

130
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:08,699
 the bill's paper and ink, then 
      stacks it in a box.  the  

131
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:14,239
  transaction, then cha-ching,  
         exact change.  coming  

132
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,642

      our cities running.

 ductile iron is more flexible  
    than ordinary gray iron.  u 

137
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:50,876
       before it breaks.        
 ductile-iron pipes are made of 

138
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:59,217
    life-span of hundreds of    
             years.             
 production begins in the pipe  

139

140
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:09,761
 the factory sorts the bits by  
           material. it discard 

141
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:15,166
  the aluminum and copper, but  
   keeps the steel and iron.    

142
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:20,905
      steel from demolished

  industrial magnet to gather   
  precise amounts of steel and  

145
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:42,727
   the shredded metals then go  
              into              
    a blast furnace fueled by   
              coke, a form of c 

146
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:51,068
  at 2,500 degrees fahrenheit,  
               the              
 iron and steel liquefy, while  

147
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,007
  workers then add magnesium.   
   this turns the metal from or 

148
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:03,615
     stronger, more flexible

 trough into a casting machine. 
   it enters a spinning mold,   
              where  centrifuga 

150
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,889
 iron against the mold walls.   

151
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:23,835
  a cooling system chills the   
 walls, and the iron solidifies 

152
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:31,309
 then an extractor pulls out a  
  20-foot-long cast-iron pipe,  
               the    standard  

153
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:37,048
  before each casting, workers  
 insert a round form, called a  

154
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,386
             mold.              
 the molten iron fills the void 

155
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:45,990
     forming a flared edge,     
         called a bell.         
  the core also seals off that  

156
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:50,061
 of the mold, preventing molten 
  iron from flying out during   

157
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:55,199
 when it's time to connect the  
 pipes, installers will fit the 

158
00:18:55,201 --> 00:19:01,472
    straight end of another.    
 a rubber gasket seals the link 

159
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:06,477
  the casting machine can make  
  pipes of different diameters  
               by  changing the 

160
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:18,156
            inside.             
  after the pipe is extracted,  
     inspectors weigh it and    

161
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:24,429
 the wall thickness to be sure  
        everything meets        
         specifications.   then 

162
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:28,766
        remove the core.        
  since it's made of sand and   

163
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,102
        disintegrates.          

164
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:48,919
  this factory makes pipes in   
     several diameters, but     
     regardless of size, the    

165
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:53,891
  process is always the same.   
  it just takes less time with  

166
00:19:53,893 --> 00:20:04,068
         harden faster.         
 a freshly cast pipe is around  
  1,500 degrees fahrenheit, but 

167
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,740
   cools quickly after leaving  
               the              
             mold.  such rapid  

168
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:13,945
 iron brittle, so the pipe goes 
   directly into a gas-fired an 

169
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:19,817
       it to 1,700 degrees      
           fahrenheit.          
    this alters the internal    
  structure of the iron, making 

170
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:25,090
      strong and flexible.      
  the pipe then runs through a  
  cooling chamber that showers  

171
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:31,830
         in cold water.         
    to prevent the iron from    

172
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:37,736
  sprayed with cement, building 
               up               
 a lining an eighth of an inch  

173
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,511
   then the pipe is spun for a  
              few               

174
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,246
   seconds to smooth out the    

175
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,181
            cement.             

176
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,449
  the entire pipe is painted    

177
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,918
        inside and out.         

178
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,786
     this seals the surface,    
            enabling            

179
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,521
  the cement to cure over the   

180
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,857
        next 24 hours.          

181
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,925
   it also provides some extra  
              rust              

182
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,794
          protection.           

183
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,529
    finally, a robot paints a   
             stripe             

184
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,531
   around the straight end of   
              each              

185
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,398
             pipe.              

186
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
 this is a depth guideline so   

187
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,868
 installation crews know when   

188

 they've inserted the straight

00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,539
  end of one pipe as far as it

190
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:23,013
     go into the bell end of    
            another.
