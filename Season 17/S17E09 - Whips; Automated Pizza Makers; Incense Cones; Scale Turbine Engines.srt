   narrator: in the old days,   

2
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,789
     ranchers used the sound    
   of the whip to move cattle.  

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,126
             today,             
 collectors buy different types 

4
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,594
   as functional works of art   

5
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:04,463
 while others practice the sport
        of whip cracking,       

6
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,732
       training to compete      
        in competitions.        

7
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,200
   there are even entertainers  

8
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,469
 who perform eye-popping tricks 
           with whips.          

9
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,543
 in the world of whip-cracking, 

10
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,146
     the best whips are made    
       of kangaroo leather      

11
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:24,150
 because it's 10 times stronger 
than cowhide of equal thickness.

12
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,486
        modern whips have       
 four main parts -- the handle, 

13
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,756
       the thong, which is      
 the flexible, braided portion, 

14
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,426
            the fall,           
 a replaceable strip of leather,

15
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,894
        and the cracker,        

16
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,163
 the thin string which amplifies
     the sound of the crack.    

17
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,899
    after carefully selecting   
       the hide to be used      

18
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,102
     for the specific whip,     
           they begin           

19
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:46,305
   by trimming away the ragged  
   edges of the kangaroo hide   

20
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,906
    with a razor-sharp knife.   

21
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,543
    this leaves a smooth edge   
       with which to work.      

22
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,048
 they now begin cutting out all 
 the whip's leather components, 

23
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,051
   most of which have strands   
   which they'll later braid.   

24
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,986
    the internal construction   
           of the whip          

25
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,588
      is made of two layers     
           of braiding          

26
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,590
     called plaited bellies.    

27
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,859
  separating each braided layer 

28
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,329
   is a solid piece of leather  
        called a bolster.       

29
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,132
    it encircles the braided    
      belly layer under it.     

30
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,400
    then, covering everything   

31
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,670
     is a final outer layer     
 of braiding called the overlay.

32
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:21,674
    they cut the strands for    
 the bellies and overlay by hand

33
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,542
     using a tapering cutter    

34
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,012
    that's specially designed   
        for whip-making.        

35
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,484
the finished overlay and bellies

36
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,886
 have a flat portion at the top 
         called the yoke        

37
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,489
           and strands          
      tapering continuously     

38
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:40,092
   along their entire length.   

39
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,895
    they stretch each strand    
       as much as possible      

40
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,431
       to ensure the braid      
   will be tight and uniform.   

41
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,968
  then, they resize each strand 
      and bevel its edges.      

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,437
     this helps the strands     
   fit into each other snugly   

43
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,373
     and create a smoother,     
         gapless braid.         

44
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,976
       then, using a tool       
     called a hand splitter,    

45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,779
     they shave the backside    
         of each strand         

46
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:02,114
     to a uniform thickness.    

47
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:06,184
this prevents lumps in the taper
      of the finished whip.     

48
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,387
   next, they take waxed cord   

49
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,455
        and tightly bind        
   a tapered strip of leather   

50
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,558
   around a handle foundation.  

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,593
        the leather strip       
         called the core        

52
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,463
   will extend into the center  
          of the thong.         

53
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,599
they attach the first belly yoke
    over the handle and core,   

54
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:24,136
     then braid the strands     
   to begin forming the thong.  

55
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:27,473
    this compresses the core    
   into a solid, round center.  

56
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:31,143
  over the braided first belly, 
  they wrap the first bolster,  

57
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,679
      then attach and braid     
        the second belly.       

58
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,015
           over that,           
  they wrap the second bolster, 

59
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:39,951
     each layer compressing     
      the ones underneath.      

60
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,222
         then, at last,         
       the final layer --       

61
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,490
          the overlay.          

62
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,425
             first,             
   they lubricate the strands   

63
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,427
          with homemade         
     animal-fat-based soap.     

64
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,096
      this not only enables     
        a tighter braid,        

65
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,965
 the animal fat also conditions 
          the leather.          

66
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,569
      this particular whip      
    has a 12-strand overlay,    

67
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,173
   but more intricate overlays  
 can have as many as 72 strands,

68
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,342
    forming complex patterns.   

69
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,981
while braiding, it's critical to
 see and align the inner layers 

70
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,916
  and pull the strands tightly. 

71
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,652
     when the thong reaches     
      the finished length,      

72
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,187
            they feed           
     the end of the braiding    

73
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,390
 through a slit in the next part
     of the whip, the fall.     

74
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,527
 they tie the remaining strands 
  in sequence around the fall,  

75
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,663
       using what's known       
      as a half-hitch knot.     

76
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,398
     then they seat the fall    
           into place           

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,133
   and trim the loose strands.  

78
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,068
this creates a secure connection

79
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,938
   between these two sections   
          of the whip.          

80
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,740
     now they roll the thong    

81
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:37,476
     between a hard surface     
     and a block of marble.     

82
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,944
   this compacts the braiding   

83
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,046
         and rounds out         
       the overall shape.       

84
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,953
    then they tie the cracker   
    onto the tip of the fall.   

85
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,889
   in the old days, they used   
   horsehair for the cracker,   

86
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,025
    also known as the popper.   

87
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:57,096
    nowadays, whip makers are   
more likely to use nylon string.

88
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:00,332
  they wrap a piece of leather  
   to build a knot foundation   

89
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,300
   at the base of the handle.   

90
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,170
  for longer and thicker whips, 

91
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:07,039
  they form the knot foundation 
      with a piece of lead      

92
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,174
  to properly balance the whip. 

93
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,511
     they fold the yoke from    
the overlay over the foundation,

94
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,847
  then, with a separate strand  
           of leather,          

95
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,317
cover the foundation with what's
  known as a turk's head knot.  

96
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,124
after trimming the knot strands,

97
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,459
       they shape the knot      
       with a soft mallet,      

98
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,527
       then more rolling.       

99
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,798
    lastly, they apply a coat   
       of natural shellac       

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,599
       to the entire whip.      

101
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,736
   this protects the materials  
   and produces a nice sheen.   

102
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,475
 no whip leaves the shop without
   a round of hands-on testing  

103
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,613
     to make absolutely sure    
 it's all it's cracked up to be.

      a craving for italian     

106
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,100
    and there's no restaurant   
            in sight,           

107
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:11,170
   you can always buy a pizza   
   from a vending machine --    

108
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:13,372
          not something         
      pre-made and packaged     

109
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,507

        in the microwave

   in less than three minutes.  

115
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,258
    you simply insert money,    

116
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,262
     then select one of four    
    different pizza toppings.   

117
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,465
           the machine          
      then makes the dough,     

118
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,932
      applies the toppings,     

119

        the fridge houses       
        four dispensers,        

128
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,372
          one for each          
of the four topping ingredients.

129
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,322
 the machine presses and dresses
         the pizza dough        

130
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,057
      on a nonstick plate,      

131
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,327
   around which they assemble   
           a housing.           

132
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,944
a motorized tray moves the plate
    in and out of the housing   

133
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:04,550
 to transfer the dough from one 
 preparation stage to the next. 

134
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,952
       technicians install      
       this assembled unit      

135
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,455
      into the left section     
          of the frame.         

136
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,634
       next, they install       
   the dough mixer above it...  

137
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,972
  ...and just below the mixer,  

138
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,376
          a plastic cup         
that receives the kneaded dough,

139
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,179
          then drops it         
      onto the press plate.     

140
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,715
   next, the flour dispenser.   

141
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:42,454
      it holds enough flour     
  to make dough for 100 pizzas. 

142
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,457
   still in the left section,   
   behind the flour dispenser,  

143
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,393
      they install and load     
   the tomato-sauce dispenser   

144
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,862
       and a bag of water.      

145
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,867
   then, in the right section,  
      they install the oven     

146
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,204
        and, below that,        
      the pizza exit slot.      

147
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,107
  once everything's hooked up,  
           a test run.          

148
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:07,613
        the action begins       
      in the left section.      

149
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:10,082
       the flour dispenser      
    releases a dose of flour,   

150
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,484
     which is actually a mix    
       of various flours,       

151
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,020
    instant yeast, and salt.    

152
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,157
  then, the water bag releases  
        a dose of water.        

153
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,361
   the mixer blends and kneads  
      all the ingredients.      

154
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:26,231
 once the wad of dough is ready,

155
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,102
     it drops from the mixer    
          into the cup.         

156
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,972
 a descending arm pushes it from
  the cup onto the press plate, 

157
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,441
     forming a 4-inch disk.     

158
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,444
       then a large press       
  flattens it out to 10 inches, 

159
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,847
    the finished pizza size.    

160
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,383
 now the tomato-sauce dispenser 
            rotates,            

161
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,453
     squirting tomato sauce     
         onto the dough         

162
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,888
     in concentric circles.     

163
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,261
     next, the pizza travels    
   through the middle section,  

164
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,929
passing beneath the refrigerator

165
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,598
           to receive           
    the selected toppings --    

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,466
      in this case, cheese.     

167
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:05,070
then, a large automated spatula,
    called a conveyor plate,    

168
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,005
         moves the pizza        
    to the right-side section   

169
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,942
       into the machine's       
         infrared oven.         

170
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:14,012
 infrared radiation works faster
    than traditional heating    

171
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,815
      because it cooks food     
       from the inside out      

172
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,151
           rather than          
      from the outside in,      

173
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:23,088
       so the pizza bakes       
       in just one minute.      

174
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,690
   the conveyor plate returns,  

175
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,826
      removes the hot pizza     
        from the oven...        

176
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,665
       ...and deposits it       
       in a cardboard tray      

177
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,667
   waiting in the exit slot...  

178
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:43,008
     cueing flashing lights,    
inviting you to come and get it.

179
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:51,183
         once a test run        
    produces a perfect pizza,   

180
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,585
         the final step         
      is to mount the doors     

181
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,855
 on this self-service pizzeria. 

182
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,690
         buon appetito.         

183
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,274
    narrator: burning incense   

184
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,476
           is a ritual          
     as old as time itself.     

185
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,746
         it likely began        
       with the discovery       

186
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,081
   that burning certain plants  
         and tree barks         

187
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,682
   generated pleasant aromas.   

188
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,953
    eventually, people began    
 compressing those sweet smells 

189
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,555
        into cone incense       
       that burned slowly,      

190
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,292
         giving the user        
       more time to relax.      

191
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,297
    lighting an incense cone    

192
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:41,300
  can instantly change the mood 
           in a room.           

193
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,635
      as the cone smolders,     

194
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,638
 it releases a bouquet of scents
   from the powdered flowers,   

195
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,974
     herbs, and other plants    
        used to make it.        

196
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:52,411
     the fragrances released    
  create a soothing atmosphere. 

197
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,522
an incense cone starts with bins
   of aromatic raw materials,   

198
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:07,726
    like dried flower petals,   
      spruce-tree needles,      

199
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,395
   and blossoms that have been  
     ground to a fine powder    

200
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,999
   to release their perfumes.   

201
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,800
  other ingredients in the bins 

202
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,669
       include tree barks       
        and tree resins.        

203
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,405
  everything comes from nature. 

204
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,077
           the factory          
    combines the ingredients    

205
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,879
    in various formulations,    

206
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,616
          depending on          
    the incense-cone recipe.    

207
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,619
the exact amounts in each recipe

208
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,355
       are closely guarded      
        company secrets.        

209
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:40,225
     they follow each recipe    
         to the letter,         

210
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,160
  measuring all the ingredients 

211
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,396
       with a traditional       
         balance scale.         

212
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,834
   there's no room for error.   

213
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,770
           otherwise,           
   the product will smell off.  

214
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,910
      this particular blend     
     is called forest honey.    

215
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:02,246
 the combination of ingredients 
        includes berries        

216
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,917
     and a pungent balsamic     
   tree resin called olibanum.  

217
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,388
     the batch should emit      
     a sweet, woodsy aroma.     

218
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:14,592
they add buckets of the measured
     ingredients to a mixer     

219
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,796
    and then turn the switch    
     to activate the auger.     

220
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,597
        the auger spirals       

221
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,668
      to evenly distribute      
  all the aromatic ingredients. 

222
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,805
     while that's happening,    
  a worker scoops up something  

223
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,007
        that looks a lot        
        like pastry flour       

224
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:34,146
         but is actually        
  a plant-based binding agent.  

225
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,316
   he mixes it with cold water  
     to liquefy the binder.     

226
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,553
    then, in a separate pot,    

227
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,357
  he adds orange food coloring  
        to boiling water,       

228
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:48,760
     and an automated whisk     
        mixes thoroughly.       

229
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:52,297
he pours the thick binder liquid
 into the orange-colored water. 

230
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:58,036
       the whisk kneads it      
 to a pudding-like consistency. 

231
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,571
     it's thick and sticky,     

232
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,909
      so it's ready to add      
   to the dried fragrance mix.  

233
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,513
       the auger works it       
    into a cakey orange dough   

234
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,516
  that's as malleable as putty. 

235
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,990
         they'll now use        
        this two-part die       

236
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,060
 to shape the dough into cones. 

237
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,532
       the worker manually      
   presses the fragrant dough   

238
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,369
  into the cavities of the die. 

239
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,607
      he compacts the dough     
      with this handy tool.     

240
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,343
   this eliminates air pockets  

241
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,379
      and ensures the dough     
      takes the cone shape.     

242
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,752
      he levels the bottoms     
      of the incense cones      

243
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,222
     and then opens the die     
           carefully.           

244
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,557
       the shapes are soft      
          and delicate.         

245
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,360
  one false move, and he could  
   destroy some of the cones.   

246
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,697
     the cautionary approach    
            pays off,           

247
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,966
    and the cones are intact.   

248
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,969
            now it's            
    into the drying chamber.    

249
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:08,507
   the temperature in here is   
around 100 degrees fahrenheit --

250
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,777
    hot enough to toughen up    
  these soft and crumbly cones. 

251
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,248
         after four days        
     in the drying chamber,     

252
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,352
        the incense cones       
  have hardened and solidified. 

253
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,124
            the cones           
   now bounce along a conveyor  

254
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,662
 past an inspector who sorts out
       any defective ones.      

255
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,733
   the good ones move forward   
    and tumble down a chute.    

256
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,535
   they land in a plastic bag,  

257
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:39,137
      and a device moves in     
        to heat-seal it.        

258
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,607
  an automated counter overhead 
     portions out the cones     

259
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,478
  to ensure the correct number  
  is deposited in each package. 

260
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,214
   after a worker puts the bag  
            in a box,           

261
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:53,551
       an automated device      
       folds down the lid.      

262
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,555
     from start to finish,      
     it takes about 14 days     

263
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,824
      to produce a package      
        of incense cones.       

264
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,361
 all that hard work is about to 
 go up in sweet-smelling smoke, 

265
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,431
       which, of course,        
       is the whole idea.       

266
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,851
            narrator:           
      the model jet engine      

267
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,187
    is a scaled-down version    
       of the real thing.       

268
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,323
        it's essentially        
       the same technology      

269
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,658
  that lifts enormous aircraft  
         off the ground         

270
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,860
        and propels them        
        through the sky.        

271
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,595
          these engines         
      were first developed      

272
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,398
for model aircraft in the 1980s,

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,603
  and they created an immediate 
    sensation on the runway.    

274
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,540
            for some            
   model-aircraft enthusiasts,  

275
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,277
          tiny turbines         
   are now the only way to fly  

276
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,947
   because they look and sound  
     like a real turbo jet.     

277
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,548
  it's a touch of authenticity  

278
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,886
 that can allow the imagination 
       to really take off.      

279
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,755
      these mini jets start     
      with the base plate.      

280
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,757
         it's the piece         
that all the other turbine parts

281
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,027
      will be attached to.      

282
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,896
         automated tools        
  transform a piece of aluminum 

283
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,432
   into an aerodynamic shape.   

284
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,634
        the little blades       
     cut into the perimeter     

285
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:21,038
     will act as air foils,     
contributing to lift and thrust.

286
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,307
      it takes just minutes     

287
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,243
     to go from a metal disk    
    the size of a hockey puck   

288
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,779
      to a precision part.      

289
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,983
   next, a worker laser-welds   
 the seams of a steal canister, 

290
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:35,787
    creating what looks like    
    a large can with holes.     

291
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,956
    this is the jet engine's    
       combustion chamber,      

292
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,458
   where a mix of fuel and air  

293
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,295
         will be ignited        
      to drive the turbine.     

294
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,267
he now inserts a hollow cylinder
       into the base plate      

295
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,269
        and then presses        
    a fuel-distribution ring    

296
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,872
         into the plate.        

297
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,808
         with the parts         
       correctly aligned,       

298
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,944
     he places the assembly     
        in a metal stand.       

299
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,214
         he dips screws         
  in a thread-locking compound  

300
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,418
  and drives them into threaded 
    slots in the base plate.    

301
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,689
    this secures and cements    
    the base-plate assembly.    

302
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:17,495
he now holds the base-plate unit
  above the combustion chamber  

303
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:20,231
        while he inserts        
  the tiny fuel-delivery tubes  

304
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,233
        into the chamber.       

305
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,701
   he flips the chamber around  

306
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,770
       to slide the tubes       
         further inside         

307
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,772
      and complete the job.     

308
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,176
  the stator vane, pressed onto 
  the other end of the chamber, 

309
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:35,513
 will redirect the flow of gases
      to the turbine wheel.     

310
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:42,053
    and now the glow plug --    

311
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:45,523
   so named because it glows    
   to ignite the fuel inside.   

312
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,659
 he pops it into a threaded slot

313
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,394
           on the side          
   of the combustion chamber,   

314
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,329
        which is, by now,       
   encased in an outer shell.   

315
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,799
        next, he installs       
     the turbine and shaft,     

316
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,803
        sliding the shaft       
    into the center cylinder.   

317
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,838
      he supports the shaft     
          on both ends          

318
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,074
      with thrust bearings      
          and washers,          

319
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:06,077
 pressing the parts into place. 

320
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,017
  next is the compressor wheel, 

321
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,822
      which pressurizes air     
  on its way into the chamber.  

322
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:22,160
 once installed, the compressor 
wheel spins at a blurring speed,

323
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,764
   and a computer analyzes it   
  for the slightest vibration.  

324
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:29,433
          any vibration         
   will signify an imbalance.   

325
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,103
   the technician drills away   
       tiny bits of metal       

326
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,439
      to lighten the areas      
          of imbalance.         

327
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,042
  the exact spot was pinpointed 
        by the computer.        

328
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,779
  he gives the compressor wheel 
          another spin.         

329
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,514
   again, the computer detects  
       a small imbalance,       

330
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,717
        and more material       
        must be removed.        

331
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,319
           the process          
    is repeated several times   

332
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,322
   until the compressor wheel   
      is perfectly balanced     

333
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,858
    and the computer gives it   
        the green light.        

334
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,261
           after that,          
  he balances the turbine wheel 

335
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,596
 on the other end of the shaft. 

336
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,399
  this mini jet engine is now   
  ready for the starter motor.  

337
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,269
   he installs it on the shaft  
 protruding from the compressor 

338
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,272
   and anchors it with screws.  

339
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,607
         once in place,         
     it will spin the shaft     

340
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,345
   until enough compressed air  
 is produced to ignite the fuel.

341
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,282
       this plastic tubing      
 will deliver gas to the engine 

342
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,884
    and oil for lubrication.    

343
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,352
   he adds a little of the oil  

344
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,722
   for the initial lubrication  
        of the bearings.        

345
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,692
     next, he heats one end     
         with a lighter.        

346
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,760
  this makes the plastic supple 

347
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,732
        so it easily fits       
       onto the connector.      

348
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:40,805
     he wires the starter to    
 a battery and tests the motor. 

349
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,043
           it works...          

350
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:50,014
  so he snaps an aluminum cover 
       onto the assembly.       

351
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,521
      this model jet engine     
  is ready for the final test.  

352
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,256
   locked down in a test box,   

353
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,059
   they pump fuel into it and   
  bring it up to full throttle. 

354
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,394
      [ jet engine whines ]     

355
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,663
  using computerized equipment, 

356
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,965
         the technician         
       monitors the output      

357
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,867
          and confirms          
     the engine is producing    

358
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,070
  an adequate amount of thrust. 

359
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,939
 that means it's ready to leave 
  the factory and take flight.  

360
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,409
            in total,           
    it takes about six hours    

361
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,278
   to make a model jet engine,  

362
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,882
         but after that,        
      the sky is the limit.
