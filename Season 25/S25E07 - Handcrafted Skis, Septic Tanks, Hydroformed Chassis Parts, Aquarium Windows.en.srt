00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,655
narrator: you can buy mass-produced skis 

4
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,390
or you could choose to purchase a handcrafted set  

5
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,992
from a small independent.    

6
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:02,061
it's a matter of preference --  

7
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,797
much like drinking beer produced by a major brewery   

8
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,465
versus a microbrewery.      

9
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,667
in fact, many ski-buying guides             

10
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,804
call small, independent brands microbrews.           

11
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,942
handmade skis typically feature             

12
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,811
exclusive designs with high-end craftsmanship.   

13
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,148
they're produced in limited quantities      

14
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,283
by small, independent companies.           

15
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,822
this maker builds the core of the ski    

16
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,158
from two types of wood --    

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,428
colorado aspen and colorado pine.        

18
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,898
they're harvested from trees killed by pine beetles.     

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,234
workers glue together 8 to 10 pieces,         

20
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,503
depending on the width of the ski.      

21
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,706
the pieces form a laminated block        

22
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,643
that's structurally stronger than a solid piece of wood.   

23
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:53,178
they clamp the block in a press for two hours          

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,581
while the glue dries.      

25
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,183
after they remove the block from the press,         

26
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,319
they use a band saw to cut off strips.        

27
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,323
each strip will be the core of a ski.        

28
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:08,461
one block typically makes six ski cores.       

29
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:12,197
next, they shape the ski cores with a router,          

30
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,267
using a template underneath the ski contour.   

31
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,540
they apply a blowtorch      

32
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,343
to strips of ultra-high molecular-weight plastic     

33
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,811
to make it bondable.       

34
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,814
then they coat the plastic with epoxy            

35
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,617
and adhere a strip of it to each side of the ski core.  

36
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:35,020
this forms a sturdy sidewall   

37
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,490
to protect the core from side impact.        

38
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,493
after the epoxy sets,      

39
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,696
they saw 6 inches off      
the front and back of the ski.  

40
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:49,068
with a hand planer, they taper the thickness of the ends.    

41
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,878
then they heat the sidewalls again to prep them for bonding.            

42
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:05,651
but first, workers glue a plastic core called a tipspacer            

43
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,787
to the front of the wood core.  

44
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,958
this holds the parts together during construction.       

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,130
then they use a hand-crank die machine     

46
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,931
to die-cut the brand name and logo     

47
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,736
into a strip of ultra-high molecular-weight plastic.    

48
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,943
they die-cut the same letters in white,            

49
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,280
then place them in the black cutout strip.    

50
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:37,282
this is the ski's base.     

51
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,686
now they can begin constructing the skis.      

52
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,754
they take a left and right base              

53
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,892
and spread epoxy over the entire surface.     

54
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,629
they lay down a layer of epoxy-saturated fiberglass  

55
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,565
and position the ski core on top.             

56
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,835
then they spread epoxy on the core and tipspacers,   

57
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,037
as well as lay extra fiberglass           

58
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,906
where the bindings will be installed.        

59
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:06,311
they position steel plates for mounting the bindings,    

60
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:10,349
then cover the entire ski with another layer of fiberglass.   

61
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,187
finally, they add a nylon top sheet    

62
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,722
printed with a graphic design.  

63
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,258
they cover the assembly     

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,862
with a series of metal sheets  
and silicone heating blankets,  

65
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:27,933
then place everything in a custom-design ski press.  

66
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,070
when workers activate the press, rubber air bladders inflate,   

67
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,907
pressing the wood into a ski shape.        

68
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,680
35 minutes later, the skis come out of the press.             

69
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:45,617
a worker separates them with a band saw.         

70
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,054
using a jigsaw, they trim the tip and tail.   

71
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,696
the saw leaves a rough edge,   

72
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,665
so workers sand the entire perimeter.    

73
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,909
then they taper and bevel the sidewall.     

74
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,413
this gives the skis a better edge grip on snow.   

75
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,718
the final step is to peel off the film     

76
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,187
that has been protecting the nylon top          

77
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,223
throughout construction.     

78
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,535
these handmade skis       

79
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,740
come in several different styles, shapes, and sizes.    

80
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,076
all they need now are bindings.            

81
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:47,947
then it's all downhill from here.            

82
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,900
narrator: septic tanks are the perfect  

83
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,170
for houses that aren't     
connected to a sewage network.  

84
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:15,641
the tank collects and treats domestic wastewater       

85
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:19,177
using a bacterial process to decompose waste.       

86
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,445
it filters the dirty water    

87
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,249
before recycling it back into the ground.      

88
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,721
septic tanks are usually made of concrete   

89
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,125
and have access covers on top.  

90
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,793
the waste-treatment process   

91
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:38,063
takes place in separate chambers inside the tank.         

92
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,069
steel bars called rebars     

93
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,939
reinforce the concrete structure of the tank.           

94
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,743
a welder assembles the rods to form a cage.         

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,148
then he spot-welds the rebar with a mig welding torch.    

96
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,154
the welded cage will maintain the structural integrity     

97
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,223
of the concrete septic tank.   

98
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,828
the welder measures the cage's diagonals  

99
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,165
to make sure it's straight.   

100
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,567
next, the worker places rebar spacers       

101
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,770
to keep the cage centered in the mold           

102
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,605
and leveled on the floor.    

103
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,513
a crane lowers the cage into a custom formwork      

104
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:31,316
made of high-strength steel plates.   

105
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,986
workers close the walls around the form         

106
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,956
and secure them in place with heavy-duty locks.      

107
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,927
the crane lowers machined steel cores       

108
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:45,064
to form the interior walls of the tank chambers.      

109
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,204
a rigid plastic tube is inserted inside a rubber sleeve      

110
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:56,742
to create a flow hole between chambers.        

111
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,077
using an acetylene torch,    

112
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,614
a worker cuts holes in the rebar for access openings.       

113
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,952
the mold allows concrete to flow over the rebar      

114
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,824
and embed the access-opening  
covers in the septic-tank lid.  

115
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,499
workers pour over 1,300 gallons            
of wet concrete into the mold.  

116
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:36,515
they use a stick vibrator to eliminate air pockets     

117
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,585
and level the walls with a putty knife.       

118
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,856
next, they mix more concrete   

119
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:49,194
and pour it over the top-slab rebar.       

120
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,396
concrete blocks are used     

121
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,867
to keep the plastic covers from floating in the wet concrete.  

122
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,075
while one worker pours the concrete in the mold,              

123
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:07,078
the other consolidates the mixture with a vibrating stick.             

124
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,050
then a worker levels the top of the slab with a trowel.    

125
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:18,657
once the concrete tank is cured, workers strip the forms.     

126
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,962
they remove the concrete tank  

127
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,365
using an overhead crane and a compressed-air system,   

128
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,469
which forces the mold away from the concrete tank.   

129
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:38,043
the crane takes the stripped core away for cleanup.      

130
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,119
a worker brushes the top of the walls       

131
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:50,656
and sweeps the floor inside the tank.         

132
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,857
then he applies a butyl-rubber tape       

133
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,860
around the top of the exterior wall.      

134
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:59,598
this forms a watertight seal between the tank and the lid.  

135
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,136
an overhead crane lifts the lid out of the formwork   

136
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:09,141
and brings it to the tank mold.              

137
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:12,477
the crane slowly lowers the lid onto the tank.  

138
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,515
workers keep it aligned to make sure it seals properly.            

139
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,754
then they label the tank to indicate its capacity.    

140
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,492
next, the mold is opened,    

141
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,694
revealing a finished septic tank.     

142
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,297
the rubber sleeve molded into the wall       

143
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,299
ensures a watertight connection           

144
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:39,170
between the pipe carrying waste from the home and the tank.   

145
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,907
this tank is now ready for delivery.          

146
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,580
they set the tank in the ground at the client's home       

147
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,884
using a radio-remote-controlled knuckle-boom crane.       

148
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,857
a septic tank like this will provide a three-bedroom house  

149
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,627
with a fully independent sewage system.          

150
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:20,812
narrator: building a vehicle begins with the chassis.     

151
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,815
chassis used to be       
made out of welded-steel parts  

152
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,285
that were very heavy and lowered fuel efficiency.   

153
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:31,356
but thanks to a manufacturing process called hydroforming,   

154
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,593
steel chassis parts are     
now much lighter and stronger.  

155
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,431
years ago, this suspension-system component            

156
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,633
would have been made by stamping a number of parts  

157
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:47,639
out of heavy steel, then welding them together.   

158
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,841
but today, the same component  

159
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,245
is made out of a single steel tube at a hydroforming plant.  

160
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,448
a solid tube is stronger than welded parts,        

161
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,052
allowing the component to be made out of lighter steel.             

162
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,121
the first step is to insert the steel tube   

163
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:07,092
in a computer-guided machine called a rotary draw bender.   

164
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,663
the machine inserts a mandrel  

165
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,800
to prevent the tube walls from collapsing.         

166
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,103
then it bends the tube into   
a starting shape for the part.  

167
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,944
this operation may look effortless,       

168
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,346
but the machine's hydraulics must generate          

169
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:32,050
nearly 9 tons of pressure to bend the steel.        

170
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:39,591
after several bends, the part has its starting shape.             

171
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,172
the hydroforming process begins             

172
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,108
when a robot places the tube in a press    

173
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,777
for preliminary shaping.     

174
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,446
this is called preforming.    

175
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,182
the press forces the tube against a die          

176
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,718
to prepare it for the hydroforming mold.    

177
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,592
here's the tube before preforming...       

178
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,461
and after.            

179
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,798
next, a robot places the steel tube in a part mold  

180
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,068
that's already mounted on the hydroforming press.    

181
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,270
the machine fills the tube with water    

182
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,673
and seals the ends to trap the liquid inside.    

183
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,742
then the machine closes the mold              

184
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,613
and raises the water pressure to 20,000 p.s.i. --       

185
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:38,617
more than 600 times the air pressure in a car tire.              

186
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,286
the high pressure softens the steel tube,     

187
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:46,358
allowing it to conform to the shape of the mold cavity.             

188
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,693
when the press opens, a robot removes         

189
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,563
the now-fully-formed part from the mold.          

190
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,099
the hydroforming press even punched holes in it     

191
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,168
for screws and bolts.      

192
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,772
next, a robot transfers the part to a circular saw,        

193
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,574
which cuts the component in half.             

194
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:07,813
this creates mirror-image right and left suspension parts.             

195
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,786
the saw left sharp edges on the ends of the part,     

196
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:19,324
so a worker smoothes them out with a handheld grinder.     

197
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,260
then they inspect the parts by putting them         

198
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,864
in a specially designed dimension-verification fixture.            

199
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,201
they use tools called precise-diameter spheres             

200
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,670
to make sure the clearances between each part              

201
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,372
meet specifications.       

202
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,476
if the parts pass inspection,  

203
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,177
they're shipped to the assembly plant.      

204
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,883
there, workers position these parts           

205
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:49,354
and adjacent suspension parts in an assembly jig.       

206
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,023
an automated machine welds them together.       

207
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:00,832
then a worker positions the next part     

208
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,635
and welds it to the rear-suspension unit.   

209
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,739
he repeats this process until the entire assembly is complete.            

210
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,312
to make the suspension unit corrosion-resistant,       

211
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,448
they apply a chemical coating  

212
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,518
which is bonded to the steel with an electrical charge.    

213
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,522
once the coating dries,     

214
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,657
automated machines insert bushings         

215
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,659
for parts that will be installed on the suspension later.     

216
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,930
bushings are rubber or polyurethane pieces  

217
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,599
that go in between two metal components       

218
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,002
to absorb shock and reduce noise.        

219
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,805
workers put the finished rear suspension   

220
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:45,277
into a shipping cradle for delivery to the auto plant.             

221
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,679
at the plant, assembly-line workers      

222
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,215
install springs and shock absorbers.       

223
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:53,952
they also mount struts, wheels, and brakes.       

224
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,622
then they install the entire unit on the vehicle.            

225
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,225
hydroforming allows auto manufacturers        

226
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,495
the ability to produce chassis parts     

227
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,363
in shapes impossible to achieve             

228
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,766
by the older method of stamping steel        

229
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,569
and reduces the weight of the car.      

230
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,790
narrator: acrylic aquarium windows are designed to be  tran 

231
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,191
but they also need to be virtually indestructible     

232
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,263
and able to hold back several hundred gallons of water.    

233
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,399
some of the largest ones are built to withstand repeated hits              

234
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,735
from sharks or other big fish  

235
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,271
that are swimming around inside the tank.         

236
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,409
acrylic aquarium windows     

237
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,546
can be molded into different shapes and sizes.   

238
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:57,815
they can also be made to various thicknesses.     

239
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,084
round, flat, or just slightly curved,     

240
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,821
these windows are worth looking into,     

241
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:07,058
because they offer close-up views of aquatic ecosystems.   

242
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,699
each acrylic window starts with an engineer's design.    

243
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,102
he takes into account the anticipated water volume   

244
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,506
and the type of marine life to be housed in the tank.    

245
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,176
next, a technician measures specific amounts of chemicals  

246
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,912
to be added to the acrylic.   

247
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:28,914
two are strengthening agents   

248
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,182
and another is a u.v.-light stabilizer    

249
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,619
to counteract the damaging effects of the sun's rays.    

250
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,724
after the chemicals have been mixed with the binding agent,  

251
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,061
they add them to a small amount of acrylic.  

252
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,262
this premix will be added    

253
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,699
to a much larger amount of acrylic later.        

254
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,267
they blend in some dye      

255
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,536
to offset the yellowish tone that's common in acrylic.    

256
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,407
the result is a homogenous mixture     

257
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,475
with a syrupy consistency.    

258
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,612
using a crane,          

259
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,215
they bring two halves of a steel mold together     

260
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,817
and place them on supports.   

261
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,222
once the walls of the mold are in place,          

262
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,692
they lock them together with bolts.           

263
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,362
the final acrylic mixture is ready.            

264
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,632
it now flows into the mold cavity.      

265
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,368
a thermostat for heat coils located in the walls       

266
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,036
is activated.          

267
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,373
they roll the mold into an autoclave.        

268
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,709
the acrylic slowly bakes under pressure   

269
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,178
to ensure a consistent cure.   

270
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,249
it takes five days        

271
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,252
for the acrylic to turn into a solid slab.    

272
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:45,457
an employee monitors the temperature readings daily.             

273
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,392
once the acrylic cures,     

274
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,527
they slice a piece off and bend it           

275
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,796
with a hydraulic tool until it breaks.         

276
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,398
if the piece can withstand    

277
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,934
14,000 pounds per square inch without breaking,        

278
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,470
it passes the test.       

279
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:04,008
at another station, they test  
the elasticity of the acrylic.  

280
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,676
they do a few more compression tests   

281
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,180
to prove that the acrylic holds strong under heavy pressure.   

282
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:18,222
after testing, they're ready to cut the acrylic slab.     

283
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,759
acrylic shrinks unevenly during the curing process,    

284
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,160
so they need to cut it      

285
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,764
to the desired size and shape afterwards.           

286
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,502
as you can see, aquarium windows             

287
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,204
are a lot thicker than normal windows.       

288
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,441
to make a contoured aquarium window,   

289
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:41,379
they lower a flat acrylic slab onto a curved molding bed.    

290
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,516
then they heat it in an oven for up to a month.        

291
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,918
this causes the acrylic to soften            

292
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,355
and conform to the rounded shape of the molding bed.       

293
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,734
once again, they've made the slab oversized            

294
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,869
to account for the distortion and shrinkage          

295
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,406
that can occur during the curing process.    

296
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:13,378
a worker cuts the curved slab to               
the engineer's specifications.  

297
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,151
he cuts off big chunks.     

298
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:25,056
they're so heavy that it takes three people to carry them away.              

299
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,828
they test the optical clarity of each window.         

300
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,166
to do this, a worker on one side of the window    

301
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,101
moves a grid pattern around   

302
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,970
while a worker on the other side              

303
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,740
scrutinizes the grid lines for distortion.         

304
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,979
satisfied that the aquarium window offers a clear view,   

305
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,582
they clean and polish it thoroughly.           

306
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,021
they'll do a final clean after the window is installed on-site.            

307
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:09,333
the time it takes to manufacture an aquarium window        

308
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,003
depends on the complexity of its design   

309
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,805
and the window's thickness.   

310
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,142
some can be produced in as little as four weeks.   

311
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,077
no matter how long it takes,   

312
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,814
there's no doubt that the views will be well worth the wait.   

313
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,292
