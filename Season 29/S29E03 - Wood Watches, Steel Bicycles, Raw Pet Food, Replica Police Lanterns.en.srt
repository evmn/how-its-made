narrator: sure, your mobile phone will give you the time, 

5
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,023
but not nearly as conveniently 

6
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,592
or fashionably as a wristwatch does.     

7
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,295
watches come in a variety of materials,         

8
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,864
often combined with stainless steel.     

9
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,666
but one of the more creative pairings       

10
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,869
is stainless steel with wood. 

11
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,507
this company makes wristwatches

12
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,176
which feature exotic hardwood accents.       

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,580
this particular model is a limited-edition series  

14
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,583
designed for new york yankees baseball fans.     

15
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,320
the blue-painted maple comes from wooden seats salvaged   

16
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,055
from the original yankee stadium,        

17
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,558
which opened in 1923.     

18
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,228
at the watch factory,     

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,430
a worker first cuts a strip of wood        

20
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,499
just over a third of an inch thick,       

21
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,001
then cuts it into blocks    

22
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,869
measuring around three fourths of an inch    

23
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,004
by a third of an inch each.  

24
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,973
manufacturers will ultimately use      

25
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,542
these blocks to make the wood inlays    

26
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,044
in the links of the watch bracelet.     

27
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,979
the worker then cuts another strip         

28
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,180
from a piece of wood,     

29
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,649
this one nearly a quarter of an inch thick.       

30
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,585
the worker then cuts this strip

31
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,020
into nearly 2-by-2-inch squares.

32
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,222
each one will become a ring called a bezel     

33
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,758
that goes around the watch dial.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,060
another worker mounts one square at a time      

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,097
on a lathe and bores a hole through the middle.   

36
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,835
she mounts several board squares         

37
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,136
onto a steel mandrill     

38
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,541
that attaches to the lathe along
with the bezel template.    

39
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,175
as the lathe turns,      

40
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,745
a steel roughing gouge rounds the squares       

41
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,815
to the diameter of the template.

42
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,083
she takes one bezel at a time 

43
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,420
and cuts it to the required thickness,   

44
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,755
about a tenth of an inch.   

45
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,257
she then shaves wood from the underside       

46
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,661
so as not to remove the historic blue paint on top.

47
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,430
to make the watch case,    

48
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,332
which houses the dial and movement,         

49
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,569
the manufacturers cut a blank piece         

50
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,971
of extruded stainless steel,  

51
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,708
then place it in a computer-guided machine.   

52
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,680
under a continuous shower of lubricant,      

53
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,582
the machine's 12 different tools

54
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,286
take turns shaping the piece into a watch case.       

55
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,356
the first tools bore      

56
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,993
a hole in the middle for the movement        

57
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:18,197
and carve a groove around the hole for the wood bezel.  

58
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,332
the next tools cut the outside profile of the case

59
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,803
and the lugs for attaching the watch band.        

60
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,505
then, the final tool drills holes in the lugs       

61
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,040
for the spring-loaded pins   

62
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,710
that attach the watch band to the case.          

63
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,782
another computer-guided machine
makes the watch band      

64
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,918
and links out of a bar of stainless steel.      

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,522
this machine reduces the bar and width, carves out the links

66
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,558
and bores holes for the connecting pins.    

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,728
a process called ion plating puts a black finish  

68
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,364
on all the stainless-steel parts.   

69
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,800
then, a worker assembles two bands      

70
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:58,103
and connects one to the watch clasp.      

71
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,106
next, he attaches the watch case window.     

72
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,308
it's made of sapphire glass,  

73
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,111
a crystal that's exceptionally durable.     

74
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,714
he inserts the self-winding movement and dial.       

75
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,883
the dial is a sheet of brass with cut-out numbers      

76
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,119
and indices over a base.    

77
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:19,023
coated in luminescent paint, the watch glows in the dark.  

78
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,025
he secures the movement to the case          

79
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,461
with a retaining ring,     

80
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:26,532
then inserts the crown, which sets the dial's hands.  

81
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:30,068
the worker screws on the stainless-steel case back. 

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
the watch's window of sapphire glass       

83
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,440
allows you to see the working movement inside.  

84
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,309
the case back is engraved   

85
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,744
with the name of the limited-edition collection   

86
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,481
and this watch's number in the series.     

87
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:47,352
he attaches the watch band to the case with spring pins. 

88
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,624
with the watch now fully assembled,        

89
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,463
it's time to inlay the yankee stadium wooden chair accents. 

90
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,664
using a toothpick,       

91
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,233
a worker applies epoxy glue  

92
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,403
to the rectangular recess in each link.      

93
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:12,611
then he places a wooden link piece in each recess.   

94
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,793
he follows the same process for the dial's wooden bezel.  

95
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,897
a worker sets the watch aside for 24 hours       

96
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,035
to let the adhesive set.    

97
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,738
then the worker buffs the entire surface       

98
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,840
on a cloth polishing wheel.  

99
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,075
this process removes the fingerprints        

100
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,512
and dust and smoothes those historic wood accents.  

101
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,816
the watch automatically winds with wrist movement   

102
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,151
to reliably tell the time   

103
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,622
while nostalgically going back in time.      

104
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,905
narrator: if you're looking for an affordable bicycle   

105
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:16,808
that's durable and has great shock absorption capabilities, 

106
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,310
then a bike made of steel is for you.      

107
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,513
it's a bit heavier than a high-end bicycle    

108
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,016
made of aluminum or carbon fiber,        

109
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:27,052
but this rugged material buys you a smoother ride    

110
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,955
at a significantly lower price.

111
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,026
this three-speed steel bicycle is sturdy    

112
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,528
and comfortable enough to ride recreationally     

113
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,398
or daily to school or work.  

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,901
a cargo rack in the rear can hold your purse,      

115
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,838
backpack or briefcase.     

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,274
the bike is made of chromoly steel,       

117
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,744
which is, pound-for-pound, stronger than standard steel. 

118
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,946
to prepare the bike's tubular parts         

119
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,648
including the frame,      

120
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,752
a worker cuts steel tube with a horizontal band saw   

121
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,821
into specific-length pieces.  

122
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,625
he then clamps certain frame pieces      

123
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,026
into a milling machine,    

124
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,596
which will cut a curve into one or both ends     

125
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,431
depending on the piece's location      

126
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,967
in the final assembly.     

127
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,439
this notch, as it's called,  

128
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,773
will let the tube butt up   

129
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,909
against the side of an adjacent tube      

130
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,311
when the bike's frame is assembled.         

131
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,381
the notched edge is ragged,  

132
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:33,518
so the worker smoothes it out with a small belt sander.   

133
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,756
certain frame parts are straight, others bent.   

134
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,591
to make the bent ones,     

135
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,692
another worker places     

136
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,028
the piece of tube in a tube bender,       

137
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,532
a press that forces the tube against a curved dye.     

138
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,068
once all the frame parts are ready,           

139
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,070
a welder clamps them in a fixture,       

140
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,040
which correctly positions them for assembly.       

141
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,146
he works with a welding torch in one hand  

142
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,815
and a rod of filler metal in the other.      

143
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,320
the torch melts adjacent tubes at their meeting point     

144
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,790
so that they fuse together.  

145
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,325
the welder also melts     

146
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,861
in some filler metal to strengthen the joint.    

147
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,707
the bicycle frame is made up of nine major parts.

148
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,479
and the welder welds them to each other in two sections, 

149
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:38,283
forming the rear triangle and the front triangle.    

150
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,551
this is the rear one,     

151
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:43,855
which alone requires nine meticulous welds.     

152
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,263
once each triangle is separately assembled,    

153
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,199
he welds them together.    

154
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,136
another worker sprays the frame

155
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,406
with powder-coat primer, then color.          

156
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,508
powder coat is an industrial-grade,      

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,811
paint-like finish,       

158
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,479
which he bakes onto the metal 

159
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,416
at almost 400 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes.   

160
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,090
when the frame comes out of the oven,        

161
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,991
another worker presses steel caps           

162
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,827
into what's called the head tube,         

163
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,496
that vertical tube at the front of the frame   

164
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,298
which holds the handlebars on top             

165
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,067
and the fork for the front wheel at the bottom.      

166
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,669
bearings inside the caps let the handlebars       

167
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,840
and fork turn left and right with ease.      

168
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,711
to put the bicycle together,  

169
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,180
the worker suspends the frame in an assembly stand      

170
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,116
and then inserts the bottom bracket,      

171
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,919
which will ultimately support the bike's drivetrain system. 

172
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,488
the bike's fenders are made of sheet steel    

173
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,091
that's shaped with pressure-applying rollers.   

174
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,162
the rear fender attaches to the rear dropout      

175
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,263
and at fender mounts at two other locations     

176
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,500
on the frame's rear triangle. 

177
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,737
he screws the cargo rack to middle         

178
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,073
and rear rack supports.    

179
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,507
then, he inserts and bolts   

180
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,511
the rear wheel into the rear dropout.     

181
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,713
the wheel hub has three built-in gears.     

182
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,981
the hub and rim are made of aluminum,     

183
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,484
which is lightweight and doesn't rust.       

184
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,955
the wheel spokes are stainless steel.      

185
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,658
next, the worker installs the drivetrain system,     

186
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,359
inserting the crank arms,   

187
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,128
already mounted to the chain ring,        

188
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,964
onto the bottom bracket.    

189
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,601
he tightens the bolt securely with a torque wrench.     

190
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,340
workers then insert the fork  
into the bottom of the head tube

191
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,210
and chrome-plated steel handlebars into the top mount, 

192
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,312
the front fender and front wheel,        

193
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,114
then install the pedals,    

194
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,550
vinyl seat, chain and chain guard.        

195
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,018
with the gear shifter     

196
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,454
and front brake lever on the handlebars,       

197
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,092
this steel bicycle is ready to hit the road.   

198
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,105
narrator: for some pet owners,      

199
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,609
feeding raw food to fido is a natural choice.   

200
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,744
it harkens back to the common ancestor     

201
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,713
of all dog breeds, the wolf.  

202
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,182
in the wild, wolves eat raw meat      

203
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,984
and occasionally some greens, 

204
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:29,454
so the theory goes that dogs are genetically predisposed  

205
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,957
to thrive on a raw-meat diet.      

206
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,596
dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years,    

207
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,331
but when it comes to their diet,         

208
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,265
they can still go a little wild.       

209
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,034
raw canine cuisine may be   

210
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,303
a foreign concept to some pet owners,      

211
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,139
but it's becoming more mainstream.        

212
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:51,575
the makers of raw dog food often mix fruits     

213
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,212
and vegetables with meat to provide fiber        

214
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,847
and create a balanced meal.  

215
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,783
the process starts       

216
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:02,454
with a lot of slicing and dicing.          

217
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,190
a food worker chops the fruits and veggies into smaller pieces

218
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,494
so they'll be able to go through a grinder more easily. 

219
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,666
he also removes the seeds from the apples and the squash 

220
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,303
because the seeds aren't as easily digested       

221
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,704
as the rest of the fruit    

222
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,940
and provide no additional nutrition.    

223
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,213
this raw pet food recipe calls          

224
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,715
for a variety of fruits and vegetables.        

225
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,883
though, in total,       

226
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,053
they will comprise just 5% of the meal.      

227
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:39,324
the rest of the raw blend will consist of meat, bones,    

228
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,760
organs and fish.        

229
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,865
another food worker chops up the chicken,     

230
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,233
which has been organically raised       

231
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,939
and has even been approved for human consumption.     

232
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,608
except for the breasts, all the parts of the chicken  

233
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,543
will be used in the main recipe.

234
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,981
this includes the heart, liver,
gizzards and the bones.    

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,954
raw, whole sardines, anchovies and mackerel     

236
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,756
will add essential fatty acids 

237
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,525
to the raw chicken blend.   

238
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,830
all the ingredients have been prepared       

239
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,700
and are now ready for grinding.         

240
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,802
a worker feeds the components to the grinder         

241
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,838
in small batches interspersing the meat,    

242
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,207
fish and the vegetables.    

243
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,846
this ensures even distribution,

244
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,918
as the grinder minces everything
to a uniform particle size.  

245
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,390
the result is a thick emulsion 

246
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,158
of finely ground chicken meat,      

247
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,128
bones, vegetables, fruits and fish.        

248
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:57,302
she transfers the minced raw ingredients to a mixer.  

249
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,707
the revolving paddles further blend the food.    

250
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,079
after about 5 minutes in the mixer,         

251
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,081
all the ingredients have been combined       

252
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,617
into one homogeneous raw mass. 

253
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,822
this chicken blend is now complete.        

254
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,825
the worker divides it into 5-pound batches    

255
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,727
and scoops it into bags.    

256
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,801
she vacuum seals the bag.   

257
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,535
removing all the air inside  

258
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,507
will allow the raw blend to stay fresh longer.     

259
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,477
refrigerated, it should last for up to 10 days and,     

260
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,181
if frozen, it should be good for several months.      

261
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,750
for the furry members of the family,         

262
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,886
dinner is ready to be served. 

263
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,823
to make some raw pet snacks,  

264
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,692
a worker de-shells new zealand          

265
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,227
green-lipped mussels,     

266
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,296
a species that is believed to have fast-acting      

267
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,934
anti-inflammatory properties. 

268
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,904
after she cuts the mussels free from the shells,     

269
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,873
she places them on racks for air-drying.        

270
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,446
she transfers the rack into a drying tent       

271
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,549
where fans keep air circulating 24 hours a day.  

272
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:22,954
as the mussels dry, they shrink.

273
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,989
after 72 hours in the tent,          

274
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:29,761
the moisture content is substantially reduced.   

275
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,296
air drying has preserved the flesh of the mussels    

276
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,497
in the raw state        

277
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,767
while preventing damage to the nutrients        

278
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,836
and enzymes they contain.   

279
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,306
now preserved,         

280
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,641
she packs the mussels into plastic bags       

281
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,811
and adds an iron oxide packet to absorb oxygen 

282
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,613
and prevent spoilage.     

283
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,087
this raw pet food is now ready 
to nourish the wolf in your dog.

284
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,805
narrator: before the invention of electricity,        

285
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,540
criminal acts were hidden by darkness.      

286
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,843
police officers carried special lanterns        

287
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,979
as they pursued suspects.   

288
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,215
today, craftsmen replicate these lanterns for the movie  

289
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,184
and television industries.   

290
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,052
these props are authentically 

291
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,122
replicated pieces of police history.       

292
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:34,158
with a thick bull's-eye lens  

293
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,327
to magnify the light from the flame,        

294
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,429
the 19th-century police lantern

295
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:42,834
helped find bad guys on shadowy streets.      

296
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,170
to replicate a vintage police lantern,   

297
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,173
the craftsman starts with a piece of steel.     

298
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,076
using a scribe, he traces around a pattern        

299
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,646
to transfer the outline to the blank.         

300
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:58,516
he marks notches for hinges and for the latch       

301
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,553
and etches the shape of the lens
hole in the center.      

302
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,524
he draws two diagonal lines in the lens hole area.     

303
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,059
the point where the lines intersect determines      

304
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,463
the exact center.       

305
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:15,533
he punches a divot into the steel at this cross point. 

306
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,506
he scribes lines along the edges        

307
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,443
for bending into a reinforced border later on. 

308
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,514
he cuts out the hinge and latch notches following  

309
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,350
the transferred pattern lines. 

310
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:39,223
next, he aligns the center divot with a punch 

311
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,759
and then activates the punch to cut out the hole      

312
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,562
for the lantern lens.     

313
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,564
the craftsman now bends wire  

314
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,234
to match the profile of the lantern door.      

315
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:54,138
he aligns the wire with the scribed lines     

316
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,541
on the edge of the door    

317
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,076
and folds the metal over it.  

318
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,981
bending the door to the correct
curvature completes the part. 

319
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,583
following another pattern,   

320
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,518
the craftsman marks the location

321
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,286
for vent holes in the blank  

322
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,524
that will become the lantern's main structure. 

323
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,127
he cuts out the vent holes where he's made the marks   

324
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,329
using a hand-operated punch.  

325
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,068
he then rolls the blank into a cylinder.        

326
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,171
it takes a couple of passes  

327
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,674
to achieve the correct curvature.     

328
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,079
moving on to the lantern's lens holder,          

329
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,582
the craftsman crimps a bead around one end.     

330
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,350
this bead helps to retain   

331
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,787
the bull's-eye lens in the holder.      

332
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,023
returning to the lantern body, 

333
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,327
he hammers the top rim around the cap.        

334
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,596
he preps the surface for soldering         

335
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:57,068
with a chemical cleaning agent known as flux. 

336
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,802
he then solders the joint   

337
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,039
to secure the top to the lantern.        

338
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,477
he also solders a raised panel to the back.  

339
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,648
this substantial panel serves as support for handles.    

340
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,855
he then cleans the solder joints with acetone.      

341
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,527
next, he wraps metal hinges around the wire        

342
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,497
that runs through the notches in the door.    

343
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,100
he crimps the hinges together at the ends      

344
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,102
and positions the door on the lantern body.      

345
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,304
he adjusts the hinges     

346
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,374
so the ends sit level on the lantern.   

347
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,812
he solders the hinges to the steel structure.    

348
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,085
the craftsman inserts the bull's-eye lens      

349
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,754
assembly into the hole     

350
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,956
in the center of the lantern door,      

351
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,525
and he solders the joint.   

352
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,860
he pins and solders      

353
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,029
the two tiers of a copper chimney.      

354
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,098
he places the chimney over the hole in the top    

355
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,566
of the lantern         

356
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,537
and tucks more pins into holes in the chimney.   

357
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,340
the craftsman installs a decorative part in the top, 

358
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,376
one that won't obstruct the chimney hole.       

359
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,845
he assembles the handles to the raised panel      

360
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,547
at the back of the lantern.  

361
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:23,521
once the soldered seam hardens, he files it down.   

362
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:27,925
the craftsman tests the latch on the door and confirms    

363
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,994
that it operates perfectly.  

364
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,299
after taping up the lens and handles,     

365
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,702
he spray paints the lantern black.       

366
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,474
now it's time to assemble the oil-burning mechanism.   

367
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,376
first, the craftsman melts   

368
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,712
solder onto a threaded brass collar          

369
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,814
and transfers it to the oil tank.        

370
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,851
he reheats the solder to melt it into the joint.   

371
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,589
he inserts the wick in the tank

372
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,925
and screws the burner to the collar.         

373
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:08,065
and that completes the lantern's light source.  

374
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:12,069
this replica police lantern will be a working prop     

375
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,873
designed to shine on tv and the movies.
