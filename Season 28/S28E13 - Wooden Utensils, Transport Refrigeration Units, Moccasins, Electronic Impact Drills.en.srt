   is meticulously handcrafted  

13
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,181
  from a single piece of maple. 

14
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:25,150
      maple is dense, so it     
     doesn't develop cracks     

15
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,086
   which can harbor bacteria.   

16
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,690
     it takes up to 28 steps    
       to make a utensil.       

17
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,928
 first, a worker planes a maple 
 plank to a specific thickness. 

18
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,364
  then, they cut it into blocks 
  the length of the utensil --  

19
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,267
      in this case, a fork.     

20
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:44,670
  the worker places each block  
      on a curved template      

21
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,171
      and traces the curve,     

22
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:50,609
      which matches the arc     
      of the fork's handle.     

23
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,612
    with a band saw, they cut   
      along the trace line.     

24
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,247
  the center of the curve runs  

25
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,650
      parallel to the grain     
          of the wood.          

26
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:00,686
 this makes the handle and tines
      of the fork stronger      

27
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,489
   than if the curve would run  
   perpendicular to the grain.  

28
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,894
      they clamp the block      
 to another template and profile

30
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,267
     then, with a band saw,     
      following the curve,      

31
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,736
    the worker cuts the block   

32

33
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,510

61
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,183

70
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,180

   of the fork remains smooth,  

71
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,783
   they soak it in hot water.   

72
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,785
        this draws up the       
       wood's short fibers

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,360

      finishing process --

78
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,599
        waxes, and lemon.       

79
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,536
   lemon works like a solvent,  
      diluting the mixture,     

80
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:08,439
      so that it penetrates     
deep into the pores of the wood.

81
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,344
   after the last coat dries,   
   a worker manually polishes

83
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,115
      sweeps off any dust,      

84
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:21,519
    then lets the finish cure   
          for 28 days.          

85
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,523
 the finish brings out the grain
     and color of the wood.     

86
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,427
    it also protects against    
     food stains, abrasion,

of the compressor and condenser.

107
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,441
     a worker then serves up    
the panels to a bending machine.

108
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,244
  it folds them so they can be  
     assembled to each other    

109
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,180
    to form the refrigeration   
         unit's housing.        

110
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,253
      an automated machine      
  bends copper pipe to form it  

111
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,823
  into tubing for refrigerant.  

112
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:08,026
        each bend changes       
   the direction of the pipe.   

113
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,162
       it's an alternative      
 to using fittings for this job.

114
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:15,968
      it means fewer seams,     
   reducing the risk of leaks.  

115
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,771
  a worker then joins the pipe  
  to create the evaporator coil 

116
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,875
   in which liquid refrigerant  
       is converted to gas      

117
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:26,778

00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,126
          the fan panel         
    completes the evaporator.   

122
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:46,064
 during operation, it will blow 
cool air into the truck trailer.

123
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,734
       the unit can be set      
    to refrigerate or freeze,

        a technician puts       
        together the unit       

126
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,775
    that goes on the outside    
          of the truck.         

127
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,577
     it compresses and then     
    condenses the refrigerant   

128
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,180
    during the cooling cycle.   

129
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,649
   she secures the compressor   
      and the copper pipes      

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,020
      to the steel housing.     

131
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:12,758
    she places a motor in the   
 housing beside the compressor. 

132
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,293
      using a rubber belt,      
      the technician links      

133
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,763
        the motor pulley        
    to the compressor pulley.   

134
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,202
  she completes the connections 
 for the inlet and outlet pipes.

135
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,974
     the condenser is next.     

136
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,345
    it transforms refrigerant   
      vapor back to liquid.     

137
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,182
     using more copper pipe,    

138
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,519
      the technician links      
the condenser to the compressor.

139
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,591
       she connects a pipe      
    to a little steel vessel    

140
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:51,763
      that will hold liquid     
 refrigerant not in circulation.

141
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,732
         the technician         
     installs a filter unit     

142
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,233
       on the outside wall      

143
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:58,403
    and links the refrigerant   
       pipe network to it.      

144
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,805
     the mesh filter inside     
         will catch dirt        

145
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,307
     in the refrigerant gas     

146
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,577
          and will trap         
     any lingering humidity.    

147
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,245
   back to the compressor now,  

148
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,781
     the technician installs    
         a second motor.        

149
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,183
       this one will keep       
    the refrigeration system    

150
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,053
          working even          
   when the truck is shut off.  

151
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,789
 all the trucker will need to do
     is plug the power cable    

152
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,825
   into an electrical outlet.   

153
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:25,297
     she attaches a pressure    
       sensor to the pipe.      

154
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,099
      the technician melts      
   metal filler into the joint  

155
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,202
    where the discharge pipe    
     links to the condenser.    

156
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:34,239
   this seals the connection.   

157
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,941
       the electronics for      
   the control panel are next.  

158
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,611
      the technician screws     
         the metal board        

159
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,213
         that holds them        
         to the housing.        

160
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,918
       then, she makes all      
   the electrical connections.  

161
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,424
       now, a safety test.      

162
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,526
   another technician connects  
         the compressor         

163
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,330
       and condenser unit       
  to a vacuum and activates it. 

164
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,332
       it suctions out air      
         in the system.         

165
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,874
  he then injects nitrogen gas  
   and traces of refrigerant.   

166
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:14,846
   if the gas escapes, it will  
 indicate a leak in the system. 

167
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,384
      to find escaping gas,     
he uses a special leak detector.

168
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,552
 it sucks in tiny amounts of air

169
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,156
         and analyzes it        
      for the refrigerant.      

170
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,357
        this enables him        
       to pinpoint exactly      

171
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,995
   where any problem might be.  

172
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,065
  another technician powers up  
      the unit and confirms     

173
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,167
     that the control panel     
           is working           

174
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:39,670
 and that the compressor motors 
     are fully operational.     

175
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,474
      they fill the system      
       with nitrogen gas.       

176
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,409
    it's a temporary measure    
          to protect it         

177
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,878
 from oxidation during shipping.

178
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,946
      the on-site installer     
          will replace          

179
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,750
 the nitrogen with refrigerant. 

180
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,620
   it has taken approximately   
     an hour to manufacture     

181
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,657
         this transport         
       refrigeration unit.      

182
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,626
    when it comes to keeping    
     food chilled or frozen,    

183
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,529
        it should deliver       
     for many years to come.    

184
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,980
 narrator: the indigenous people
        of north america        

185
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,182
       invented moccasins       
      to protect their feet     

186
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,051
  from harsh weather conditions 

187
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,053
         and to provide         
      spiritual protection      

188
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,089
 in the form of symbols stitched
        into the leather        

189
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,825
     to evoke sacred places     
           and things.          

190
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,728
  the idea was to protect both  
      the soles of the feet     

191
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,531
          and the soul.         

192
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,933
        today, moccasins        
       are mass-produced.       

193
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,402
      factories make their      
          own versions          

194
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,205
  of this traditional footwear. 

195
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,473
      this one generates up     
          to 100 pairs          

196
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,444
   of moccasin slippers a day.  

197
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,946
        production starts       
      with rabbit-fur pelts     

198
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,381
      that are a by-product     

199
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,483
         of the european        
      rabbit-meat industry.     

200
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,719
       the furrier places       
       a plastic template       

201
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,556
         over the pelt.         

202
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,626
     he draws lines through     
   the slats of the template.   

203
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:12,464
   this outlines stripes to be  
   used to trim the moccasins.  

204
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,968
      using a razor blade,      
   he cuts out the fur strips   

205
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,304
      and sets them aside.      

206
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:24,342
  one pelt will provide enough  
trim for two pairs of moccasins.

207
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,779
 using dies made of sharp steel,
      the furrier cuts out      

208
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,515
    the suede leather parts.    

209
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,784
       a hydraulic press,       
     as known as a clicker,     

210
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,719
     drives the dies through    
       through the leather      

211
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,355
    to punch out the pieces.    

212
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,590
     the largest one will be    
       used for the bottom      

213
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,459
   and sides of the moccasins.  

214
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,994
      it's called the foot.     

215
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,798
         the other parts        
     are a sole to reinforce    

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
           the bottom           
          and the vamp,         

217
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,368
       which is the upper       
      part of the slipper.      

218
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,875
     next, the furrier cuts     
       out pieces of thick      

219
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,543
        polyester fleece        

220
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,347
       which will be used       
     to create plush liners.    

221
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,849
    he arranges the moccasin    
    components in the correct   

222
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,519
      sequence for sewing.      

223
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,253
    this is called a layout,    

224
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,190
          and it helps          
  the sewing process go faster. 

225
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,630
       the furrier presses      
   an adhesive-back size label  

226
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,098
          to the bottom         
        of the foot part.       

227
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,537
       the sewing machine       
        operator stitches       

228
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,542
      the sole of the foot      
  through to its fleece liner.  

229
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,611
     she also sews the label    
         to the leather         

230
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:36,314
   to fasten it more securely.  

231
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,484
  she folds the back sides up,  
           inside-out,          

232
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,654
 and sews them together to form 
    the heel of the moccasin.   

233
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,462
   the worker trims the fleece  
  that protrudes from the seam. 

234
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,131
     she then folds the heel    
         right side out.        

235
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,837
 now that the foot and sole have
been joined and the heel formed,

236
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,175
      the worker turns her      
     attention to the vamp.     

237
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,912
     she sews beaded designs    
   into this moccasins' upper.  

238
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,915
                     ♪♪         

239
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,823
     these geometric designs    
     are a nod to the past,     

240
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:22,627
   but their purpose is purely  
   ornamental, not spiritual.   

241
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,500
  after lining the beaded vamp  
with fleece, the worker stitches

242
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,468
         a leather strip        
        around the edges,       

243
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,539
        creating a border       
        known as a welt.        

244
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,375
     the welt gives the vamp    
    a more attractive finish.   

245
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,980
   to sew the vamp to the rest  
        of the moccasin,        

246
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,484

 narrator: an impact drill is a 
 power tool that's tough enough 

271
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,210
 to bore through hard materials,

272
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,313
      such as brick, stone,     
          and concrete.         

273
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,351
    it can also drive screws    
into softer materials like wood.

274
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,854
 an electronic impact drill has 
  the added feature of a switch 

275
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:33,291
  that amps up the drill speed  
     if the job requires it.    

276
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,763
  an impact drill is comprised  
       of the drive unit,       

277
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,032
       the back part with       
       the electric motor,      

278
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,400
      and the gear unit --      

279
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,336
    the front part containing   
    the motor-rotated spindle   

280
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,305
    that turns the drill bit.   

281
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,441
       to make the housing      
       for the gear unit,       

282
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:53,244
    the factory furnace melts   
      down solid aluminum.      

283
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,747
       then, an automated       
   casting machine injects it   

284
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,882
        at high pressure        
        into a mold with        

285
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,786
  six housing-shaped cavities.  

286
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,456
 once the machine cools the mold
  to re-solidify the aluminum,  

287
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,758
         a robot removes        
        the hot housings        

288
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,261
       and submerges them       
     in water to cool them.     

289
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,466
      the robot then places     
          the housings          

290
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,434
         in an automated        
         stamping press,        

291
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,436
         which cuts off         
      the connecting metal,     

292
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,539
    separating the housings.    

293
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,510
        a computer-guided       
    milling machine finalizes   

294
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,046
    the shape of each housing   

295
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,914
and forms a collar for attaching

296
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,616
         a second handle        
   that provides extra control  

297
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,953
      when drilling through     
         hard materials.        

298
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,923
    elsewhere in the factory,   

299
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,192
        a computer-guided       
      turning lathe shapes      

300
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:46,330
        a solid steel bar       
     into the drill spindle.    

301
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:50,101
  back to the gear housing now, 
   a worker positions it next   

302
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,970
 to a spindle assembly fixture. 

303
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,739
  she lines up a grooved wheel, 
     called a ratchet wheel,    

304
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,809
  over the housing and inserts  

305
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,412
        another one into        
      the spindle fixture.      

306
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,748
   then, she puts the spindle   
       through this second      

307
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,449
    ratchet wheel and inserts   

308
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:10,321
     the first ratchet wheel    
 into the housing with a press. 

309
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:14,659
 the worker inserts the spindle 
with its wheel into the housing.

310
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,627
       this makes the two       
         ratchet wheels,        

311
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,363
     so that they'll move up    
   and down against each other  

312
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,232
    when the spindle rotates.   

313
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,339
     after installing a seal    
       and retaining clip,      

314
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,974
 she completes the gear unit by 

315
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:34,312
      installing the gears      
    that rotate the spindle.    

316
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,514
          an automated          
   injection-molding machine,   

317
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,849
       meanwhile, produces      
       the plastic housing      

318
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,818
     for the electric motor.    

319
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,354
      the machine makes two     
       housings at a time.      

320
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,992
      the motor is made up      
    of a stationary component   

321
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,460
         called a stator        

322
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,264
    and a rotating component    
         called a rotor.        

323
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,833
   a worker inserts the stator  
        into the housing,       

324
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,302
  pushes it down into position  
          with a press,         

325
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,206
  then secures it with screws.  

326
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,876
  he mounts the electronic unit 
     that lets you regulate     

327
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,678
    the speed of the spindle.   

328
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,884
   after installing a flange,   
  the worker inserts the rotor  

329
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,320
  and presses it into position. 

330
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,190
  the rotor has a fan attached  
   to cool the running motor.   

331
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,860
   he connects the electronic   
       unit to the motor.       

332
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,066
 now, everything comes together.

333
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:31,268
    using an assembly guide,    
     a worker positions half    

334
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,304
  of the drill's plastic handle 

335
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,106
      then wires the motor      
          to the switch         

336
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:38,409
        that's connected        
     to the electronic unit.    

337
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:43,447
   moving the switch increases  
or decreases the drilling speed.

338
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,485
         next, she takes        
    the drill's power cable,    

339
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,521
 applies a device that prevents 
     the cable from kinking,    

340
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,959
      then screws the cable     
         to the switch.         

341
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,798
   the worker closes it all up  
           by affixing          

342
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,201
         the other half         
     of the plastic handle.     

343
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,442
   this completes the assembly  
 of the back part of the impact 

344
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,611
 drill known as the drive unit. 

345
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,785
  a worker places the gear unit 
      onto the drive unit.      

346
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,759
      an automated machine      
      screws them together.     

347
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,595
 every impact drill this factory
       produces undergoes       

348
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:35,133
       performance testing      
   and a critical safety test.

350
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,873
       if the tool passes       
           inspection,          

351
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,543
        the spindle gets        
       awarded its chuck.       

352
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,446
   the chuck is the component   
    that holds the drill bit.   

353
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,218
a computer-guided laser engraver
     marks the model number     

354
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,088
   and all the technical data   
      on the motor housing.     

355
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,929
     then, workers pack the     
  electronic impact drill along
