 [ slow classical music plays ] 

12
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,345
    playing an instrument in    
 the violin family takes guts --

13
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,546
           literally.           

14
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,549
         that's because         
  the instrument's four strings 

15
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,618
  are made of sheep intestines. 

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,020
        the two thinner,        
       higher note strings      

17
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,355
     are made of plain gut.     

18
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,757
        the two thicker,        
       lower note strings       

19
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,226
         have a gut core        
     wrapped in silver wire,    

20
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,096
  then silk thread wound around 
        the extremities.        

21
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,167
         the intestines,        
   each roughly 65 feet long,   

22
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,769
 come from local slaughterhouses

23
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,705
   and arrive already emptied,  
      cleaned, and salted.      

24
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:50,108
         the first step         
  is to soak them in cold water 

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,710
      for one to two days.      

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,580
    this starts a controlled,   
    very smelly decomposition   

27
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,450
      which helps loosen up     
   the intestines' components.  

28
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:00,119
    next, using a half piece    
          of wood cane,         

29
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,054
  the string maker scrapes off  

30
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,191
     the outer layers of fat    
      and mucosa membranes.     

31
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:08,461
     then, five times a day     
           for a week,          

32
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,731
       he softens the gut       
   in an alkaline potash bath   

33
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,000
      and pulls it against      
   a handmade copper thimble.   

34
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,869
    this gently scrapes away    
       the waste remnants       

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,273
     until the gut is a tube    
  of pure, transparent muscle,  

36
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,877
   at which point he slices it  
      with a splitting horn     

37
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,813
      into two gut ribbons      
      of differing widths.      

38
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,282
     the thinner, right one     
   for making violin strings,   

39
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,350
      the thicker, left one     

40
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,287
        for making cello        
    and double bass strings.    

41
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,491
   during the scraping phase,   
   guts sometimes break apart.  

42
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,227
       rather than discard      
          these pieces,         

43
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,162
        the string maker        
       knots them together      

44
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,664
 to produce full-length strands.

45
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,302
  the string maker's assistants 

46
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,305
      cut the gut ribbons       
      into 23-foot lengths      

47
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,441
 and bleach them for four days. 

48
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,911
      this prevents the gut     
       from turning brown.      

49
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,180
       then they count out      
 the number of strands required 

50
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,850
           to produce           
   the various size strings --  

51
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,786
        from six to make        
   the thinnest violin string   

52
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:13,592
  all the way up to 120 to make 
the thickest double bass string.

53
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,461
   they tie the ends in a loop  

54
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:18,196
        and hook them up        
     to a twisting machine,     

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,865
  then turn the machine's crank 

56
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,200
        and tightly twist       
    the gut ribbons together    

57
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:26,538
       to form one strong,      
         single string.         

58
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,275
      then, since the guts      
  have begun to dry out a bit,  

59
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,742
    they rehydrate the string   

60
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,412
  to restore a consistent level 
          of moisture.          

61
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:37,149
    then they twist it again    
        and transfer it,        

62
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,820
 along with additional strings, 
       to a drying frame.       

63
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,088
   there's no set drying time.  

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,892
    they monitor each string    
 individually around the clock. 

65
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,427
       as a string dries,       

66
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,897
     it shrinks in diameter     
      but grows in length,      

67
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,299
         creating slack.        

68
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,235
   so, they repeatedly remove   
           and retwist          

69
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,770
   until it dries completely,   

70
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,905
  at which point it stabilizes. 

71
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,374
           this drying          
     and retwisting process     

72
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,443
   can take up to seven days.   

73
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,911
       the string is ready      

74
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,648
    when it's hard and stiff    
     and slightly yellowed.     

75
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,584
         at that stage,         
  they rub it with horsehair -- 

76
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,521
   the traditional equivalent   
      of coarse sandpaper.      

77
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:19,658
   it makes the string smooth   
      and even throughout.      

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,860
     next, they fine-polish     
           the string           

79
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,395
   with abrasive, dried grass   

80
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,198
in a cloth that's been moistened
         with olive oil.        

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,268
       some string makers       
         use almond oil         

82
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,338
  and pumice or powdered glass  
        as the abrasive.        

83
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:40,278
     they sever the strings     
     from the drying frame      

84
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,481
          and cut them          
      to standard lengths.      

85
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,751
      these strings will be     
    for a child-size violin,    

86
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:49,288
so they're 100 centimeters long.

87
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,890
 to produce the correct sounds, 

88
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,360
        the instrument's        
     two lower-note strings     

89
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,095
  must be considerably thicker  
        than the others.        

90
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,698
         the problem is         
   this thickness in gut alone  

91
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,366
   would produce a dull sound,  

92
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,637
     so they wrap the string    
   in sterling silver wire --   

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
          silver being          
  seven times denser than gut.  

94
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,374
      this gives the string     
         the right sound        

95
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:14,513
   and a loud, brilliant tone   
     with minimal thickness.    

96
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,248
      next, for decoration,     

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,585
  they wrap the top and bottom  
    of these gut-core strings   

98
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,586
        with silk thread.       

99
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,121
       on a violin string,      

100
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:25,391
the silk runs about a centimeter
        long on each end.       

101
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,459
    on a longer cello string,   
         like this one,         

102
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,728
      about 5 centimeters.      

103
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,463
       the finished string      

104
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,332
     is ready to be inserted    
   into its retail packaging.   

105
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,469
    there are less expensive    
synthetic strings on the market,

106
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,738
            however,            
  particularly for early music, 

107
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,274
      many musicians prefer     
       the sound and feel       

108
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,009
  of traditional gut strings -- 

109

       narrator: absinthe       
   is a strong alcoholic drink  

111
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,234
    with a colorful history.    

112
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,902
      during the late 1800s     
        and early 1900s,        

113
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,305
            drinking            
   this anise-flavored spirit   

114
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,308
          was the rage          
    among european bohemians.   

115
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,311
    conservatives of the day    
 saw it as dangerous and immoral

116
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,579
          and succeeded         
   in getting absinthe banned   

117
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,015
      in several countries.     

118
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,922
       the traditional way      
        to drink absinthe       

119
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,924
       is to pour one part      
          into a glass,         

120
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,861
  straddle a specially designed 
          slotted spoon         

121
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,597
      holding a sugar cube      
         over the glass,        

122
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,866
     then, very slowly, drip    
  three to five parts ice water 

123
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,669
     directly onto the cube,    

124
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:48,807
      dissolving the sugar      
    into the diluting spirit.   

125
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,811
    this transforms the drink   
      from clear to cloudy      

126
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,547
          and draws out         
  the subtle flavors and aromas 

127
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,149
   of the herbal ingredients.   

128
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,218
         you can do this        
       with a single glass      

129
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,221
 or several using a traditional 
      absinthe fountain --      

130
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:05,224
  a large mounted glass vessel  

131
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,827
  which dispenses the ice water 
    through multiple spigots.   

132
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,298
        this 180-year-old       
        french distillery       

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,634
   makes both white and green   
      versions of absinthe.     

134
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,571
  each is made from a different 
  combination aromatic plants.  

135
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,306
       however, for both,       

136
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,978
   the primary ingredients are  
 green anise and grand wormwood.

137
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,912
    both also contain fennel.   

138
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,516
       the white absinthe       
         has more of it.        

139
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,652
     and only green absinthe    
   contains additional plants,  

140
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:38,057
     such as petty wormwood,    
  hyssop, mint, and chamomile.  

141
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,793
     the distillery workers     
   pour the recipe ingredients  

142
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,262
      into a copper still.      

143
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,899
they pump in highly concentrated
alcohol made from white grapes. 

144
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:50,402
         the plants soak        
 in this alcohol base overnight,

145
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,537
  gradually imbuing the alcohol 

146
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,607
  with their respective flavors 
           and aromas.          

147
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,944
          this process          
      is called maceration.     

148
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,147
          the next day,         
      distillation begins.      

149
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,282
       they heat the still      
     with pressurized steam.    

150
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,553
     after about 45 minutes,    

151
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,822
       the spirit reaches       
       the boiling point,       

152
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,691
      and a floating gauge      
  monitoring its alcohol level  

153
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,959
          slowly rises          

154
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,627
     and flows out the neck     
          of the still.         

155
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,035
 however, what comes out during 
   the first 10 minutes or so   

156
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,836
      has to be discarded.      

157
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,640
        it's white, oily,       
  and has a 90% alcohol level.  

158
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,243
          what follows          
      is the good stuff --      

159
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,711
         crystal clear,         

160
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:36,314
  with an average alcohol level 
         of 78% to 80%.         

161
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,250
      this streams steadily     
        out of the still        

162
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,719
 for about three to five hours, 

163
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,588
followed by a weak tail-end flow

164
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,856
        that they discard       
      like the first flow.      

165
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,794
        then they dilute        
this distilled spirit with water

166
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:52,064
  to reduce the final alcohol   
  level of this white absinthe  

167
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,731
             to 60%.            

168
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,735
     to make green absinthe,    
   before that final dilution,  

169
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,873
  they pump the white absinthe  
      through a burlap bag      

170
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,741
 containing a specific plant -- 

171
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:07,146
      the identity of which     
  the distillery won't divulge. 

172
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,214
     they let the plant soak    
         in the absinthe        

173
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,816
 for a specific length of time. 

174
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,286
         this draws out         
    the plant's chlorophyll,    

175
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,355
     which colors the spirit    
          bright green.         

176
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,291
   then they dilute with water  

177
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,361
      to obtain the target      
      alcohol level of 62%,     

178
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,830
         slightly higher        
      than white absinthe.      

179
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,900
    that extra bit of alcohol   
 helps preserve the chlorophyll.

180
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,436
      in the distillery's       
      in-house laboratory,      

181
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,507
quality-control technicians test
    a sample from each batch    

182
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,709
 to verify the alcohol content. 

183
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,847
   absinthe contains about 20%  
 more alcohol than most spirits.

184
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:49,121
        the lab monitors        
      the level of thujone,     

185
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,456
a chemical compound in wormwood,

186
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,126
           the drink's          
     second key ingredient.     

187
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,528
  thujone content is regulated  

188
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,197
       to varying degrees       
       in many countries.       

189
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,865
   the european union permits   

190
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,467
   up to 35 parts per million,  
          for example,          

191
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:06,672
      while canada, no more     
    than 7 parts per million.   

192
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,473
   the distillery, therefore,   

193
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,076
    bottles several versions    
          of absinthe,          

194
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,011
 tailoring the wormwood portion 
          of the recipe         

195
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,747
   to the export destination.   

196
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:20,686
         white absinthe         
    has a strong anise taste,   

197
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,687
  well balanced with wormwood,  

198
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,023
     whereas green absinthe,    
     containing more plants,    

199
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,760
   has a more complex flavor.   

200
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,429
while white is typically bottled
         in clear glass,        

201
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,831
     green is always bottled    
     in dark-colored glass.     

202
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,835
   that's because chlorophyll,  

203
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,104
        the plant pigment       
 that produces the green color, 

204
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,640
  is highly sensitive to light. 

205
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,776
       without dark glass       
   shielding it from exposure,  

206
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,978
    the green absinthe inside   
        would turn yellow       

207
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,113
      and eventually brown.     

208
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,184
    this would have no effect   
    whatsoever on the taste,    

209
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,785
    however, the potent drink   

210
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,454
  known in 19th-century france  

211
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,722
        as<i> la fée verte,</i>        
        the green fairy,        

212
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,359
  would lose some of its magic. 

213
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:16,074
   narrator: there are reports  

214
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,477
    of archaeologists finding   
  evidence of belts and buckles 

215
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,614
     dating back to the 6th     
  and 7th centuries in britain. 

216
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,815
     decorative belt buckles    

217
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,151
    appear to have been worn    
       for the first time       

218
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,554
      as symbols of status      
          in the 1500s          

219
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,622
   throughout regional spain.   

220
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,962
             today,             
   hand-engraved belt buckles   

221
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,831
       are prized not only      
     as fashion accessories     

222
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,168
    but as inspired examples    
    of workmanship and art.     

223
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,639
  the buckle maker welds small  
  stainless steel rods together 

224
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,775
 to form the back of the buckle.

225
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,977
       after placing them       
      in a welding fixture,     

226
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:55,380
    he precision-welds them.    

227
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,981
     using another fixture,     

228
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,085
 the buckle maker adds a center 
 pin to the back of the buckle. 

229
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,123
   after precision-welding it   
           into place,          

230
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,726
        he melts the tip        
   of the stainless steel pin   

231
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,195
       into a smooth ball.      

232
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:14,199
        this locating pin       
 centers the belt in the buckle.

233
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,200
        the buckle maker        
      uses a jeweler's saw      

234
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,602
 to cut the shape of the buckle 

235
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,305
        from heavy gauge        
     solid sterling silver.     

236
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:29,548
   he stamps the company logo   
  into the back of the buckle.  

237
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,083
       using pure silver,       

238
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:35,087
   he solders the welded rods   
  onto the back of the buckle,  

239
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,423
  along with a stainless steel  
         keeper tongue.         

240
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,227
     he uses a jeweler's saw    
      to cut out initials,      

241
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,796
         using the font,        
       material, and size       

242
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,832
    selected by the customer.   

243
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,301
        the buckle maker        
      uses a soldering gun      

244
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,903
         to apply solder        
   to the back of the letters,  

245
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,505
  which are made of gold fill,  

246
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:57,041
      a thin layer of gold      
        on top of brass.        

247
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,044
     he carefully positions     
          the initials          

248
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,778
 on the sterling silver buckle, 

249
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,449
which has been covered with flux
for the soldering phase to come.

250
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,718
         too much solder        
   on the back of the letters,  

251
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,788
      and it could flow out     
    onto the buckle surface.    

252
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,123
     heating the belt buckle    

253
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,525
        causes the solder       
   on the back of the letters   

254
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,795
        to attach firmly        
 to the sterling silver surface.

255
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:21,199
     the attachment process     
     happens very quickly.      

256
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:25,003
   with a polishing compound    
   and cloth polishing wheel,   

257
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:29,474
       he gives the buckle      
       a brilliant shine.       

258
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,344
        the buckle maker        
    hand-engraves the buckle    

259
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,813
 using assorted engraving tools.

260
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,752
     he uses a shading tool     
     to add depth to lines.     

261
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,555
      he follows guidelines     
       drawn in felt pen.       

262
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,591
      the pattern engraved      
   is chosen by the customer.   

263
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:54,166
    the belt maker rolls out    
  a piece of tan strap leather. 

264
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,366
      using a gauge knife,      

265
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,302
        he cuts the width       
        of leather needed       

266
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,872
     to make the belt chosen    
        by the customer.        

267
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,111
         the belt maker         
     uses a variety of tools    

268
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,113
  to cut and shape the leather. 

269
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,015
  he cuts the tip of the belt.  

270
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,787
      he places the leather     
    in room-temperature water   

271
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,255
     for about five minutes.    

272
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,326
    when bubbles stop rising,   
    the leather is saturated.   

273
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,061
  after the leather has dried,  

274
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,800
   he transfers a pattern from  
the design strip to the leather.

275
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,740
    stamping tools allow him    
   to stamp intricate designs.  

276
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:38,610
      using a swivel knife,     
       he cuts to a depth       

277
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:43,147
 of between a quarter to a third
 of the way through the leather.

278
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,752
       the initial pattern      
        has been carved.        

279
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:50,822
   with a beveler, he deepens   
  and shapes the carved lines.  

280
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,827
  he chooses a bar backgrounder 

281
00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:00,031
         to create leaf         
       in the background.       

282
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,499
      with a swivel knife,      

283
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,635
            he makes            
   the final decorative cuts.   

284
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,303
   the belt maker applies dye   

285
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,372
   to the background sections   
     of the carved leather,     

286
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,978
  completing the most intricate 
        part of his work.       

287
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,013
 he stamps in the maker's mark. 

288
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,185
   using a piece of sheepskin,  

289
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:24,189
    he applies an oil finish    
          to the belt.          

290
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,724
a thin paste highlights the cuts

291
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,595
       and gives the belt       
       an antique finish.       

292
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,532
      a final tanned coat       
      waterproofs the belt      

293
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,000
      and helps protect it.     

294
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,969
   he makes holes in the belt.  

295
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,877
    the belt has a bend in it   

296
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,146
        where the buckle        
        will be attached.       

297
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,752
      with chicago screws,      

298
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,622
  he attaches the buckle firmly 
          to the belt.          

299
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,561
  ideally, the belt and buckle  
     complement each other.     

300
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,496
       strong and stylish,      

301
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,399
    meticulously handcrafted    
     belt buckles and belts     

302
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,235
      have managed to make      
    a clear fashion statement   

303
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,937
     out of belt-tightening.    

304
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,718
    narrator: the lever lock    

305
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,653
          was invented          
    in the late 18th century    

306
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,188
        by an englishman.       

307
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,790
   at the time, the ward lock,  

308
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,526
        with its simple,        
   concentric plate mechanism,  

309
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,794
    was the main kind of lock   
             in use.            

310
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,532
   it was medieval technology   
    and fairly easy to pick.    

311
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,802
  the lever lock took security  
      to a whole new level.     

312
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,207
     more than two centuries    
     after their invention,     

313
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,876
      lever locks are still     
        on security duty.       

314
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,946
          the mechanism         
      hasn't changed much,      

315
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:58,817
  except instead of two levers, 
    there can be many inside.   

316
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,285
      they fall into slots,     

317
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:03,755
        locking the bolt        
  until a key lifts the levers. 

318
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,157
      this lever mechanism      
         is very rugged.        

319
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,892
  it will continue to function  

320
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,962
    even if dirt or moisture    
      infiltrates the lock.     

321
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:14,633
   it's why many armed forces   
will only use this kind of lock.

322
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,968
     to make the two halves     
        of the lock body,       

323
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,371
           they uncoil          
  a narrow band of heavy steel. 

324
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,040
     rollers straighten it.     

325
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,710
    then a punch press shapes   
     and cuts out the part.     

326
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,914
      four punches produce      
      a fully formed part.      

327
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,249
         the front half         
    includes the side flange,   

328
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,287
      the keyhole, a post,      
        and rivet holes.        

329
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,994
        the parts tumble        
        with wood chips,        

330
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,597
    and the friction removes    
   unwanted bits called burrs.  

331
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,333
 the chips also absorb residual 
    oil from punch pressing.    

332
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,470
 they punch out the lock levers 
        and other parts.        

333
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,940
     they plate all 23 parts    
        with yellow zinc.       

334
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,879
       next, rivets funnel      
    into a network of tubing.   

335
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:06,351
   they tumble four at a time   
    into an assembly device.    

336
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:10,622
there are different-sized rivets
  to fit different-sized holes. 

337
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,157
       the delivery system      
        pushes the rivets       

338
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,694
        up through holes        
     in the assembly device.    

339
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:19,030
a factory worker places the back
  of a lock body on the rivets, 

340
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:22,968
      and a hydraulic press     
    squeezes them into place.   

341
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,437
   he keeps a stash of rivets   
        at the workbench        

342
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,573
  in the event that the tubing  
        doesn't deliver.        

343
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,308
    the back of the lock body   

344
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,311
     is now ready to receive    
       the lock mechanism.      

345
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,381
     there are 240 different    
       lever combinations.      

346
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:39,584
         the next worker        
  determines which one to use.  

347
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:43,121
    she places the bolt lever   
          in the casing         

348
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,391
 and slides all the other levers
          onto a rivet.         

349
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:50,128
 there are a total of six levers
   in this particular padlock.  

350
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,997
      some locks have more,     
        some have fewer.        

351
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,434
   the more levers there are,   
the tougher the lock is to pick.

352
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,673
    she wraps a metal spring    
        around a rivet...       

353
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,545
 ...and then hinges the shackle 
        to a third post.        

354
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,681
  she sets the back half aside  

355
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:14,752
 and assembles the keyhole cover
 to the front part of the lock. 

356
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:19,557
she winds a spring around a post
  and places the cover over it. 

357
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,295
 the spring will allow the cover
   to be swung open and shut.   

358
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,598
         a rivet secures        
       the keyhole cover.       

359
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:33,104
     she now brings the two     
   lock body halves together,   

360
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,974
   so the rivets from the back  
   protrude through the front.  

361
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:39,277
     she flattens the rivets    
   to hold the parts together.  

362
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,982
  the next part is the clevis.  

363
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,784
   it's a u-shaped attachment   
           for a chain          

364
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:50,889
 to make the lock easier to hang
 onto when not in lockdown mode.

365
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,795
 another worker now categorizes 
  the locks in separate boxes,  

366
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,730
   according to the key code.   

367
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:02,934
 he leaves a key code i.d. card 
          in each box.          

368
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,603
    when transferring a lock    
          for painting,         

369
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,338
  that i.d. card goes with it.  

370
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
  this system prevents mix-ups, 

371
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,577
  so that later they'll be able 
     to make keys to match.     

372
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,618
      they spray the locks      
         military green         

373
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,455
    and give them four coats    
    for corrosion resistance.   

374
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,894
       it's time to rev up      
         the key cutter.        

375
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,096
   there are 240 key profiles   

376
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,099
   to match the 240 lever lock  
          combinations.         

377
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,568
  the operator sets the blades  
     in the desired sequence    

378
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,606
and carves the keys to give them
       the right geometry.      

379
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,377
    with the correct profile,   

380
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,647
    the key lifts and lowers    
     the levers in the lock     

381
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,850
      to open and close it.     

382
00:20:56,656 --> 00:21:00,391
       a standard padlock       
      comes with two keys.      

383
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,859
  if the owner loses them both, 

384
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,395
      the lock will usually     
      need to be replaced.      

385
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,798
 that's because the keycode is  
 never written on the lock body 

386
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,234
  to avoid tipping off thieves. 

387
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,939
     the technician confirms    
      that both keys work,      

388
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,409
  and this lever padlock is now 
    ready to thwart criminals   

389
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,678
   and safeguard possessions.   

390
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,491
