00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,024
narrator: today, on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,994
mouth-blown window glass...   

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,966
...water pumps...

...sake...            

7
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,811
...and tweezers.         

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,656
before machine-made plate glass became popular in the 1920s,   

9
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,926
window glass was blown by artisans.      

10
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,661
today, specialty companies    

11
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:04,663
still make window glass the traditional way.       

12
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,800
while machine-made glass is uniformly clear and flat,   

13
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:11,337
mouth-blown window glass has subtle variations.      

14
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,541
this german company       

15
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:21,146
produces a wide variety of mouth-blown sheet glass.   

16
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,016
it's used to make contemporary wall light panels.             

17
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:27,954
it can also be used to make clear or stained glass windows.            

18
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,693
the company can make glass sheets           

19
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:37,330
in 5,000 different colors and textures.          

20
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:46,305
this furnace melts silica sand and other natural materials   

21
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,240
into glass.           

22
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,176
the starter begins by inserting the end of a blowpipe      

23
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,045
into a furnace.         

24
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,851
he takes a small amount of colorless molten glass    

25
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,120
out of the furnace        

26
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,055
and rotates it in a wooden mold.        

27
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,924
the mold is lined with heavy paper         

28
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:08,928
to soften the surface.      

29
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,197
then, he inserts a metal needle through the blowpipe       

30
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,666
to create a pathway for air.   

31
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,742
he returns to the furnace for more molten glass.      

32
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,212
the artisans make multiple trips to the furnace,         

33
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:28,213
shaping the molten glass in stages            

34
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,684
so it's easier to handle.    

35
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:36,489
this time, the assistant shapes the glass with a large mold.   

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,690
when the shape is set,      

37
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:39,959
the assistant prepares it for blowing.     

38
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,294
he uses a fork tool to push the glass        

39
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,498
to the top of the pipe.     

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,834
the starter rotates the glass in a larger, paper-lined mold  

41
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,503
to round it further.       

42
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,107
the molten glass cools rapidly          

43
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,909
once it comes out of the furnace.       

44
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,846
if the temperature dips below 1,800 degrees,    

45
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,782
it's not longer workable.    

46
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,253
so the team must work quickly and reheat the glass repeatedly.           

47
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,788
another assistant lubricates the blowpipe     

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,925
so it will rotate easily on the support stand.      

49
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:17,062
the starter hands the glass over to the master glassblower.          

50
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,064
first, he rotates the blowpipe  

51
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,666
to straighten and center the drooping glass.       

52
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,336
then, he begins turning and blowing into the pipe    

53
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,206
to gradually inflate the glass.             

54
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,475
this requires great physical strength        

55
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:34,146
as well as tremendous artistic and technical skill.       

56
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,750
the pipe and glass weigh over 30 pounds combined.     

57
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,019
when the glass starts to cool,  

58
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,555
the assistant reheats it in a smaller oven.  

59
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,024
he passes the pipe back to the glassblower,     

60
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,194
who then resumes inflating it.  

61
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,500
this time, he swings it upside-down,    

62
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:59,371
using gravity to help elongate the shape.       

63
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:04,110
next, he will transform the   
glass balloon into a cylinder.  

64
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:08,313
first, he reheats the tip of the glass       

65
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,583
and weakens it with a hot burner.        

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,988
then, he reheats the entire glass cylinder.    

67
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,124
this expands the air inside   

68
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,193
and forces the weakened tip open.      

69
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,262
the glassblower taps the opposite side        

70
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,599
of the hot glass with a cold metal stick.     

71
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,602
the thermal shock causes a neat stress break.   

72
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:33,605
this releases the glass from the blowpipe.        

73
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,674
then, the assistant slices it lengthwise       

74
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,410
with a glass cutter       

75
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,947
and hands it off to the flattening team.     

76
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,818
their job is to transform    
the cylinder into sheet glass.  

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,619
the flattening master's assistant            

78
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,156
puts the cylinder into a furnace.         

79
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,628
it's heated to over 1,500 degrees.      

80
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,363
the glass softens in about 30 minutes.       

81
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,965
then, the flattening master   

82
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,834
reaches into the opposite end of the furnace with a stick   

83
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,906
and gently opens the cylinder.  

84
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,774
next, the flattening master   

85
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:14,046
irons the glass sheet with a special wooden tool.   

86
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,515
the flat sheet goes into the annealing oven   

87
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,251
for a gradual controlled cooldown.       

88
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:23,122
this relieves stress and prevents cracking.      

89
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,990
the flatting master's assistant            

90
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,125
removes the glass from the annealing oven     

91
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,662
and performs a visual inspection.       

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,267
the last step is to cut the edges straight.    

93
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,804
to make multicolored and textured glass,       

94
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:45,210
they add additional ingredients during the melting process.   

95
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,681
mouth-blown window glass contains natural variations   

96
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:53,552
that play with the light and create a subtle glow,    

97
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:57,289
a glow that machine-made window glass can't replicate.  

98
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:12,104
narrator: water is essential for life.   

99
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:15,307
but most of earth's fresh water is trapped underground.     

100
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,844
to tap into these reservoirs, we need water pumps.       

101
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,047
they've existed in many forms for thousands of years.     

102
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,783
the designs have improved over time,     

103
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,721
and today's water pumps are truly an underground success.  

104
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,327
for farmers           
and municipal water providers,  

105
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,665
the turbine water pump is a workhorse.         

106
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,934
it can pump thousands of gallons of water       

107
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,869
out of the ground every minute.             

108
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,274
they start by making diffuser bowls          

109
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:51,810
using urn-shaped castings.    

110
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:56,081
one turbine pump could have up to 30 diffuser bowls.     

111
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,284
the bowls hold         
the pump's spinning impellers.  

112
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,754
computerized tools refine their shape        

113
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,890
so the bowls fit neatly in the pump column.       

114
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,892
another set of tools carve the bronze impellers.   

115
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,494
they fine-tune the casings    

116
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:14,633
so that the impellers will fit into the diffuser bowls.     

117
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:18,036
here's a look at both sides of the finished impellers.    

118
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,106
an uneven impeller will vibrate when spinning.   

119
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,110
a technician uses this machine to check for imbalances.     

120
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,245
when sensors locate the problem,            

121
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,448
he sands down the metal in that area.          

122
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,316
this balances the impeller.   

123
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,252
next, a machine         

124
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,423
carves the top attachment ring of the discharge head.      

125
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,529
the discharge head shields the motor from water.  

126
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:47,666
it also changes the water flow from vertical to horizontal.   

127
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,402
next, a machine carves the outflow flange    

128
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:54,806
and drills holes for attaching a gasket.     

129
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,076
an employee paints the part blue.      

130
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,946
the paint protects the metal against rust.          

131
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,884
he also highlights the embossed company name    

132
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,020
with bright red paint.      

133
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:11,223
here are the machine parts before and after painting.    

134
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:15,360
next, they make the pump's shaft pipes.     

135
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,496
tools work on both ends of the pipes simultaneously   

136
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,366
to refine the inner diameter.  

137
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,634
then, they carve threads into them.            

138
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,537
they clean the pipes, then roll them into the holding area.              

139
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,377
next, computerized tools     

140
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,380
cut threads into the bronze bearings.    

141
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,915
these threads will interconnect          

142
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,518
with the ones on the shaft pipes.       

143
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,655
a worker screws the completed bearings      

144
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:48,060
into the ends of the shaft pipes.       

145
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:52,097
then, he screws the pipes together in a loose preassembly.          

146
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,805
he brushes lubricant onto the exposed section of the bearings.            

147
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:04,810
he links four pipes to create one 20-foot pipe.   

148
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,546
he sets the long pipe in a cradle-like device     

149
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,749
and activates the drive wheel.  

150
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,486
as the pipes tighten,      
the bearing disappears inside.  

151
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,696
the worker inserts a steel shaft into each 20-foot pipe.     

152
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,404
he caps the ends to secure the shafts inside the pipes.   

153
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,977
this wider pipe is called the column pipe.    

154
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,247
an employee attaches      
an assembly flange to each end  

155
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,316
and secures it with bolts.    

156
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:50,456
a worker connects a suction bell to one of the shafts.      

157
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,126
the suction bell will draw the well water into the pump.  

158
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,929
then, he slides an impeller into place.           

159
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,867
he secures the impeller to the shaft           

160
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,337
with a tapered clamp called a collet.         

161
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,474
he encases the impeller in an iron diffuser bowl.    

162
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,143
he bolts the diffuser bowl to the suction bell.       

163
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,345
they add more impellers     

164
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,815
to increase the power of the water pump.        

165
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,217
a more powerful pump       

166
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,253
will be able to extract water from deeper underground.     

167
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,359
they apply protective paint to the pump,           

168
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,562
and then, it's ready to install.      

169
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,634
on site, workers use special equipment  

170
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,137
to help guide the pump into the well.          

171
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,641
they join the shaft pipe to the pump.           

172
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,648
then, they slide the column pipe around the shaft pipe      

173
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,817
and bolt it to the top of the pump.           

174
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:58,123
the team adds more shaft pipe for a deeper reach.       

175
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,093
then, they install the discharge head.              

176
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,664
this turbine pump is now ready to extract water  

177
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,334
from great depths underground.  

178
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,151
narrator: sake is japanese rice wine.   

179
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,221
it's distinguished by two main factors --      

180
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,491
how the rice is milled before fermentation,       

181
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:34,493
and whether there's any distilled alcohol      

182
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,828
added to the final blend.    

183
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,764
sake can be mass-produced    

184
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,832
or handcrafted the traditional way.       

185
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,303
this canadian microbrewery    

186
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,774
only makes pure rice wine called junmai-shu.        

187
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,244
the brewery doesn't add any extra alcohol to their sake.              

188
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,512
the clear sake, known as seishu,             

189
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,248
have a subtle, fruitier, nutty flavor.          

190
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,718
cloudier sake is called nigori.             

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,320
it contains rice sediment,    

192
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:05,256
which produces its creamier texture.      

193
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,526
the rice is milled before it arrives at the brewery.    

194
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,796
milling removes the proteins and lipids     

195
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,965
on the outside layers of the rice grain.        

196
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,736
this rice has 30 percent of its grain milled away.    

197
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,673
the starch of the core will produce premium sake.    

198
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,541
first, they wash the rice.    

199
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,811
then, the pour it in a porous bag         

200
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,280
and soak it in cold filtered water.     

201
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:32,818
the brewmaster checks the rice with his hands.         

202
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,153
once it reaches the right consistency,      

203
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,155
they drain the bag overnight.  

204
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,925
then, they pour the rice into a steamer.         

205
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:49,234
the steamer cooks the rice under pressure for about an hour.   

206
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,835
they cover the steamer with cloth            

207
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,573
to contain the rice as it cooks.             

208
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:59,511
the steamer softens the rice but doesn't overcook it.     

209
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,579
to ferment at the right speed,  

210
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,650
the rice needs to be firm on the outside and soft     

211
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:07,652
in the center.          

212
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,122
workers separate the rice by hand,             

213
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:14,459
then use fans to cool the rice down to about 98 degrees.    

214
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,462
next, they transfer it to a heated room.        

215
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,063
they spread out the rice     

216
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:23,935
and cover it with mold spores imported from japan.       

217
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,338
when heated, the spores germinate and grow on the rice.              

218
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,741
the spores secrete enzymes    

219
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:35,013
that will transform the starch into fermentable sugars.     

220
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,283
workers insert a thermometer into the rice          

221
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:42,286
then wrap it in cloth to hold in the heat.       

222
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,955
48 hours later,         

223
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,158
the sweet rice, called koji, is ready.            

224
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,628
now, they begin the fermentation process.    

225
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,031
they mix 3/4 of steamed rice with 1/4 of koji         

226
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,834
in a temperature-controlled fermentation tank.        

227
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,637
then, they add spring water and yeast.            

228
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,106
the mold enzymes in the koji   

229
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:05,777
convert the starch in the steamed rice into sugars.             

230
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,247
the yeast consumes those sugars and produces alcohol.      

231
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,585
the process takes about three weeks.        

232
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,388
the brewmaster checks the temperature, acidity,    

233
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,792
residual sugar, and alcohol levels every day.  

234
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:24,796
when the brew is ready, they pour it into cloth bags.  

235
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,866
they neatly stack the bags in a traditional japanese    

236
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,501
mechanical press.        

237
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,608
large sake breweries automate this entire process,  

238
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,210
but this smaller operation    

239
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:42,481
follows century-old traditions and does everything by hand.   

240
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,149
as the press fills up,      

241
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:48,420
the weight of the bags kick-starts the pressing.    

242
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,823
they seal the press with heavy steel plates     

243
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,226
and mount the pressing mechanism.     

244
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,296
as they turn the crank,     

245
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:02,033
the press squeezes all the liquid out of the bags.              

246
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,301
when they're done,        

247
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:07,705
only unfermented rice will be left behind.       

248
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,774
the liquid sake drains out of a spout      

249
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,743
at the base of the press.    

250
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,319
they age the sake in refrigerated tanks      

251
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,921
for up to 4 months.       

252
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:32,330
as it ages, the sake develops deeper and more complex flavors.            

253
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,066
not only is this sake entirely handcrafted,      

254
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,470
it's also hand-bottled.     

255
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,605
workers use a gravity-fed filling machine  

256
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,541
to pour sake into these glass bottles.    

257
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,678
the dark bottles protects the sake from uv rays,              

258
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,114
which would spoil its color and flavor.           

259
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,617
next, they add the aluminum twist cap.              

260
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,286
a machine molds it to the shape of the bottleneck        

261
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,756
and crimps the bottom rim.    

262
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,691
they apply a label to each bottle          

263
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:04,762
with a simple hand-crank machine.       

264
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:09,034
full-strength sake has an    
alcohol content of 18 percent.  

265
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,102
some sake is diluted with spring water        

266
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,306
to bring the alcohol content down before bottling.      

267
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:20,712
the sake this brewery produces is unpasteurized.    

268
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:25,450
this enhances the flavor but requires refrigeration.   

269
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,604
narrator: tweezers were first used    

270
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,208
these indispensable tools help us grip small objects.   

271
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,010
we use tweezers to pull splinters        

272
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,879
and unwanted hair from our skin.          

273
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,747
they can also handle the tiny parts          

274
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,584
found in mechanical devices, like watches.          

275
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,824
when something small eludes our grasp,        

276
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,892
tweezers help us pick them up.  

277
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,762
they act as an extension of our forefinger and thumb,   

278
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:14,899
allowing us to grab and hold on to the tiniest things.      

279
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,368
first, a worker preps the tweezer mold      

280
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:22,574
by grinding and sanding around the tweezer-shaped cavity.    

281
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:23,908
this smoothes the mold,     

282
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,113
making it easier to cut out the metal parts.         

283
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:32,150
a worker buffs the mold to give the surface a glossy finish.   

284
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,058
a computer-guided machine    

285
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,261
carves a die cutter out of a steel block.      

286
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,396
it uses an electrified brass wire    

287
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,933
to slice through the steel.   

288
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,737
the die cutter perfectly matches the tweezer mold.    

289
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,406
after the tools are prepped,   

290
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,675
they're ready to make the tweezers.      

291
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,676
a coil of thick stainless steel wire       

292
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,680
unwinds into the molding machine.       

293
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,883
rollers straighten out the kinks.            

294
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,822
an automated device grabs the wire          

295
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,491
and pulls it between the die-cutter and the mold.   

296
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,231
the die-cutter pushes the wire into the mold          

297
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,566
and cuts out the shape it needs.             

298
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,502
the excess steel slides out,   

299
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:28,039
and a spool collects it for recycling.    

300
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,110
the mold ejects the part into a bin.           

301
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,846
they are a little thinner at the gripping end.       

302
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:39,250
this design gives the tweezers more flexibility.        

303
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,319
an employee places two of the parts           

304
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,122
in an induction welder.     

305
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,457
he activates the welder     

306
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,926
to fuse it twice at the gripping end.       

307
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,397
a double weld reinforces the joint,      

308
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,034
making it very difficult to pull the tweezers apart.   

309
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,474
this welder assembles approximately 3,000 pairs    

310
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,176
of tweezers per shift.      

311
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,883
each pair of tweezers is thoroughly polished      

312
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:15,420
to make them smoother and easier to grip.       

313
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:19,357
it's a multi-step process.    

314
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,494
first, an employee       
sands the body of the tweezers  

315
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:26,964
using fine abrasive paper and polishing cream.       

316
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:31,236
next, the tweezers go into a vibrating polisher.  

317
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,505
they bounce around with ceramic stones       

318
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:38,309
and various polishing solutions for 24 hours.          

319
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,179
after that, they        
wash off the chemical residue.  

320
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,381
then, they filter and neutralize the water.    

321
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,917
using another device,      

322
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,853
they shoot fine glass particles at the tweezers.         

323
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,522
this gives them a satin finish that's durable          

324
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,957
and resists scratching.     

325
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,831
a worker levels a tweezers' tips using a sanding belt.      

326
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,935
she makes sure the claw-like tips        

327
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,538
are exactly the same length and angle.            

328
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,412
another member of the team sands the inside of the tips   

329
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,348
using a very fine abrasive disc.              

330
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,651
this will improve the tweezer's grip.       

331
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:30,361
the factory also makes carbon steel tweezers.   

332
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,698
they're a cheaper alternative to stainless steel.       

333
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,768
they immerse the carbon steel tweezers in a chrome solution  

334
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,504
to protect them from rust.    

335
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:44,041
the tweezers' electrical charge attracts the chrome.       

336
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,145
the result is a shiny      
and protective chrome plating.  

337
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:55,853
next, an employee prepares the tweezers for laser lettering.  

338
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,655
she places them in a fixture   

339
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,225
and selects the image on her computer.         

340
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,263
she activates the laser,     

341
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,932
and it permanently etches the graphics onto the metal.   

342
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,475
next, she rubs special oil onto the surface of the metal  

343
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,179
and cleans the tweezers thoroughly.           

344
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,619
she also inspects the tweezers for any cosmetic flaws      

345
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,054
and makes sure they function properly.     

346
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:37,828
these tweezers are now ready for plucking, primping,  

347
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,964
and any other small jobs.
