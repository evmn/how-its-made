stainless steel panels,

the delorean was known for its flashy style.

the process starts with the diagnostics.        

23
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,035
the technician examines the suspension,

he disassembles many pipes and hoses

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,468
that run coolant from the radiator to the rear engine.  

34
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,471
many of the coolant pipes will need to be cleaned    

35

the rubber hoses can't be salvaged

in order to know what needs to be replaced,   

50

the technician must take the engine apart.  

51
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,587
he removes the air filter box 

52
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,323
in order to access the intake manifold.      

53
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,793
then he unbolts the "w"-shaped manifold pipe  

54
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:18,196
that splits the air flow to the engine.         

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,401
once it's off, he removes the air-mixture control unit, 

56
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,270
which needs restored to work. 

57

with the unit out of the way, 

58
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:31,276
he can easily get to other parts
that need replacing or fixing. 

59
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:35,614
those include spark plugs, wires, vacuum lines,      

60

the distributor cap, and rotor.

61
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:41,086
under the front hood, the mechanic          

62
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,489
pulls the fuel pump out of the gas tank        

63
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,491
to check for deterioration.  

64
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,226
it's beyond repair.      

65
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:51,096
he drains any fuel the remains in the tank.    

66
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,566
after the gas tank has been emptied and cleaned,      

67
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,503
he inserts a new, modern-style pump module.          

68
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:01,040
another technician holds the top of the pump down    

69
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:05,177
as the module is clamped into place.          

70
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,648
next, the technician removes the interior door panels    

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,321
and uses a central tester to operate the power windows. 

72
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,523
he confirms the power windows are functional.        

73
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,460
he also checks the power locks and mirrors  

74
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:25,331
to verify that they're working properly.   

75
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,333
he pulls off exterior rubber trim.     

76
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,736
he shaves off any remaining rubber bits.          

77
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,272
this allows room to repair a dent        

78
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,742
in the stainless steel body.  

79
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:43,282
he files the area around the dent to remove some scratches. 

80
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,418
he places a special tool over the dent.         

81
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,222
it has a rod with a fine steel tip that welds to the body,  

82
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:55,694
providing a solid grip, as he manually pulls out the dent.  

83
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,830
meanwhile, another mechanic  

84
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,499
applies tape to various sections of the car 

85
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,034
to establish borders      

86
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,437
for the refinishing of the steel body panels.   

87
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,242
he sands out any imperfections or tool marks from the repairs 

88
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,180
and restores the brushed finish
bumper to bumper.       

89
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:16,381
since no paint can be used   

90
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,451
to cover up repairs on bare stainless steel,    

91
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,188
the body work must be done perfectly.           

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,592
inside, technicians reupholster the seats     

93
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:30,862
and treat any discoloration in the vinyl panels and dashboard.

94
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:35,935
finally, the entire car gets an extensive exterior cleaning.

95
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,405
it's taken months to restore this delorean,         

96
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:43,542
but the question remains, will it run like a new car?

the bars are placed on a large electromagnet.

the magnet holds them securely,

303
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,866
while the bars rotate under a grinding stone.    

304

a steady flow of coolant    

305
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,136
prevents the heat the friction generates     

306

from changing the hardness of the steel.

the grinder removes carbon deposits

along with any surface imperfections.   

310
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,817
a craftsman uses a rockwell hardness tester

312

the machine's needle bears down

the bar is now ready to be friction forged.        

316
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,905
the forging machine's specialized tool        

317
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,906
applies immense pressure,   

318
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,710
combined with rotational movement called "stirring,"  

319
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,646
to a specific area of the bar. 

320
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,182
the stirring action creates friction,       

321
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,317
which plasticizes the steel,  

322
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,454
reducing its microscopic grain structures to levels   

323

no other forging or heat-treating method

used in a high-quality knife. 

327
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,668
the finer the grain size, the stronger the steel,

the sharper and less brittle the blades

the unforged zone becomes the blade's main body.
