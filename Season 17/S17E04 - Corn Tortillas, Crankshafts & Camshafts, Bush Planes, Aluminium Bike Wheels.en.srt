    discovery communications    

3
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,588
   narrator: the corn tortilla  
    is the original flatbread   

4
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,123
    invented, legend has it,    

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,860
   thousands of years ago by a  
 mayan peasant to feed his king.

6
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,864
        a royal appetite        
  may have been the inspiration 

7
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,699
  for this unleavened creation, 

8
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,467
 but it soon gained mass appeal 

9
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,337
      and became a staple       
      of the mexican diet.      

10
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:19,145
   the corn tortilla has been   
 popular for thousands of years.

11
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,747
      in the last century,      
        demand has grown        

12
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,616
   as people in many countries  

13
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,085
         acquire a taste        
      for tex-mex cuisine,      

14
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,555
     like tacos, enchiladas,    
           and nachos.          

15
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,694
     corn tortillas are now     
   mass-produced in factories,  

16
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,696
     and the process starts     
     with grade-"a" corn --     

17
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,365
            dehusked            
    and removed from the cob.   

18
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,902
  there are millions of kernels 
        in one truckload.       

19
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,503
  they unload onto an elevator  

20
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,240
 that takes them several stories
  up to deposit them in a silo. 

21
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,508
       they're stored here      

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,378
   until the factory is ready   
      to start production.      

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,215
they then spill out of the silo 
and into big steel cooking vats.

24
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,856
      a worker adds water,      
 completely immersing the corn. 

25
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,792
 he activates a steam-injection 
         heating system,        

26
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,594
  and as the temperature rises, 

27
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,064
  he tosses in numerous scoops  
     of powdered limestone.     

28
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,598
    it acts as a preservative   

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,135
  and helps soften the kernels  
         during cooking.        

30
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,871
 as they soften, the outer skin,
      or pericarp, loosens,     

31
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,809
        releasing starch        
  and creating a foamy effect.  

32
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,079
        after 45 minutes,       
     they turn off the heat,    

33
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,614
       and the corn steeps      
        for eight hours.        

34
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,684
    with the kernels softened   
   even more by the long soak,  

35
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,088
      it's time to wash off     
 a lot of the loosened pericarp.

36
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,160
        a little pericarp       
still clings to the cooked corn,

37
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,895
  but that's part of the plan.  

38
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,763
 it will act as a bonding agent 

39
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,199
          when the corn         
    is shaped into tortillas.   

40
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,837
      the corn now funnels      
     into a spiraling blade     

41
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,839
 that delivers it to a grinder. 

42
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,975
         they add water         
       and a preservative.      

43
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,712
 the auger moves the ingredients
   between two volcanic stones  

44
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,714
      that grind everything     
        into a corn mash.       

45
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,652
  the mash has a grainy texture 
      similar to couscous.      

46
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,922
 that changes when they press it
      through an extruder.      

47
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,959
     the extruder kneads it     
    into a dough called masa.   

48
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,499
 as the masa exits the machine, 
   it's collected by a worker.  

49
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:28,340
 he transfers the corn dough to 
 a machine called a pre-sheeter.

50
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,210
     here, automated paddles    
          push the masa         

51
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,279
  between two sets of rollers.  

52
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,149
      the rollers press it      
      into a thick sheet.       

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,684
       the sheet of dough       
 travels through another machine

54
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,954
   called the sheeter cutter.   

55
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:48,227
  in this machine, more rollers 
  squeeze the dough paper-thin  

56
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,497
        as a die cuts out       
     round tortilla shapes.     

57
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:56,168
        they roll and cut       
    84,000 tortillas an hour    

58
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,169
      on the sheet cutter.      

59
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,375
       another big roller       
       takes up the matrix      

60
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,644
          to be reused          
   in the next batch of dough,  

61
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:09,114
      as the cut tortillas      
      head into the oven.       

62
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,718
   once inside, the tortillas   
      zigzag back and forth     

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,054
  on three tiers of conveyors.  

64
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:17,523
         the lowest tier        
   has the lowest temperature,  

65
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,192
 and the top tier, the highest. 

66
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,927
   this three-tiered approach   

67
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,130
  gradually bakes the tortillas 
       in just 21 seconds,      

68
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,001
    producing corn tortillas    
with just the right consistency.

69
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:33,205
  a vacuum system suctions the  
 tortillas to the next conveyor 

70
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,473
 to keep them from falling off, 

71
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,944
        as they now head        
      to a cooling station.     

72
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:43,481
 here, the tortillas again move 
          to and fro --         

73
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,051
this time on nine conveyor tiers
            to cool.            

74
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,758
 from a handful of corn kernels 

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,893
       to a piece of round      
        unleavened bread,       

76
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,695
 once the corn has been cooked, 

77
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,832
   the transformation happens   
        in just minutes.        

78
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,638
  whether the tortilla is made  
  from white corn, yellow corn, 

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,442
      or dyed other colors,     
the taste will be much the same.

80
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,213
    exiting the cooling zone,   
 the tortillas move into lanes. 

81
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,451
these lanes orient the tortillas
         in single file         

82
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,187
      so they land in slots     
      and stack up neatly.      

83
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,925
 a sensor keeps a running count,
 and when there's a pile of 40, 

84
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:30,196
 a trapdoor opens and sends them
     to the packaging line.     

85
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:34,199
  these tortillas are now ready 
  to add a little latin sizzle  

86
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,868
          to the menu.          

87
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,870
    packaged in stacks of 80,   

88
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:41,874
 they're headed for restaurants 
        and cafeterias --       

89
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,610
         fried, steamed,        
   or just warmed in the oven.  

90
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,012
     when they start adding     
          the fillings,         

91
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,647
     things could get spicy.    

92
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,232
   narrator: in every vehicle,  
   there are rotating shafts.   

93
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,567
     the crankshaft converts    
  the pistons' vertical action  

94
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,172
    into the circular motion    
    that drives the wheels.     

95
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,107
       at the same time,        
       the camshaft turns       

96
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,577
        to open and close       
         airflow valves.        

97
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,648
these precision parts are behind
   every successful start-up.   

98
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,186
 life on the road can be tough, 

99
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,322
     and a good crankshaft      
     has to keep on turning     

100
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,791
when the engine is under stress.

101
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,864
      the crankshaft starts     
   with a forged steel shape.   

102
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,667
      a computerized blade      
     shaves off excess metal    

103
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,802
          from sections         
     called counterweights.     

104
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,937
      they offset the load      

105
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,339
     of the engine's pistons    
      and connecting rods,      

106
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:51,143
and this process slims them down
      to create a balance.      

107
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:55,147
a computerized drill bores holes
    into one of the bearings    

108
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,683
  to reduce the overall weight. 

109
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,219
   next a worker removes marks  

110
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:03,888
     the computerized tools     
     have left on the metal.    

111
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,292
 he sands the entire crankshaft.

112
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,194
           the surface          
   must be completely flawless  

113
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,963
   for it to operate smoothly.  

114
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,502
 fine glass beads blast the part

115
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:19,237
         as it revolves         
   in a rotisserie-like device  

116
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,839
    to knock off sharp edges    

117
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,843
     and give the crankshaft    
      a consistent finish.      

118
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,312
         the crankshaft         
     then spins in a lathe,     

119
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,316
     as a blade slices away     
    a precise amount of metal   

120
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,651
from each of the counterweights.

121
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,787
         this machining         
    provides enough clearance   

122
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,057
    for the engine's pistons    
      and rods to function.     

123
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:44,196
    the crankshaft then takes   
    another spin in a device    

124
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:47,099
        that has sensors        
    to detect any imbalance.    

125
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,402
          it calculates         
that just over 29 grams of metal

126
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,205
   still needs to be removed.   

127
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,273
       once the adjustment      
         has been made,         

128
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,010
     he measures the degree     
        of straightness.        

129
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,611
   if it's off even slightly,   

130
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,547
   he corrects it by applying   
      pressure with a press     

131
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,883
           and tapping          
    a special radius chisel.    

132
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,820
    he then measures again to   
 confirm he's done an even job. 

133
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,889
   on the left is a crankshaft  

134
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,824
    that hasn't been balanced   
        or straightened.        

135
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,162
  on the right is one that has. 

136
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,365
   production now moves to the  
engine's other rotating shaft --

137
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,900
          the camshaft.         

138
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,904
  machining transforms a steel  
  billet into the basic shape.  

139
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,439
      like the crankshaft,      

140
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,575
     this camshaft will need    
      a lot of fine-tuning.     

141
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,844
        an automated tool       

142
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:35,046
  first etches the part number  
     and date onto one end,     

143
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,050
     and then they get down     
     to the precision work.     

144
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:41,120
     the camshaft must also     
     be completely straight,    

145
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:44,589
  so the technician measures it 
    from one end to the other   

146
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,860
      and makes adjustments     
          where needed.         

147
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,196
    next he selects a master    
   template of a camshaft lobe  

148
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,066
          and places it         
     in a grinding machine.     

149
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:59,337
this master is the pattern to be
   copied by a grinding wheel.  

150
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,809
 once it's been locked in place,
    he activates the grinder.   

151
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,944
   it carves into the camshaft  

152
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,947
     as it rotates and rocks    
 back and forth in the machine. 

153
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,952
       the grinding wheel       
     moves down the camshaft    

154
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:18,857
  to shape all 16 lobes to the  
 exact contours of the template.

155
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,630
 this is how the camshaft looked
  before the master grinding... 

156
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:27,632
           and after.           

157
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,568
    next a computerized probe   

158
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,170
      measures the profile      
          of each lobe          

159
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:36,375
and confirms that the dimensions
     and lift are identical.    

160
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,378
      at the next station,      
       the camshaft spins       

161
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,247
 to allow a worker to completely
    coat the journal bearings   

162
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,515
        with a blue dye.        

163
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,584
   the dye masks the bearings   
       to keep them smooth      

164
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,054
 while the rest of the camshaft 
      is being parkerized.      

165
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,525
      parkerizing will give     
 the camshaft an etched finish, 

166
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,660
  which protects against wear.  

167
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,396
 they start with a quick rinse. 

168
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,466
 then they plunge the camshafts 
    into hot phosphorus acid.   

169
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,469
            the acid            
microscopically etches the metal

170
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,138
      while other chemicals     
           in the bath          

171
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,006
  add a thin graphite coating.  

172
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:13,011
     they rinse the residue.    

173
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,080
   after the finish has dried,  

174
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,616
   a worker buffs the journal   
 bearings as the camshaft spins.

175
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:23,489
  this completely rubs off the  
blue dye and polishes the metal.

176
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,528
  he then wipes down the entire 
    camshaft with a dry rag.    

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,501
     he places the camshaft     
   on a perforated metal shelf  

178
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,504
     and floods it with oil.    

179
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:42,040
    some oil drains away, but   
  a residue clings to the part, 

180
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,510
        and that residue        
      will prevent rusting.     

181
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,114
         once packaged,         
       this rotating shaft      

182
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,918
    is on its way to a garage   
         or car factory,        

183
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,654
       where, ultimately,       
       it will do its part      

184
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,223
           to help set          
      the wheels in motion.     

185
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,277
            narrator:           
 bush planes are designed to fly
   in and out of remote areas.  

186
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,812
       they're engineered       
 to be able to take off and land

187
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,714
        on short runways.       

188
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,683
   they can also be outfitted   
           with floats          

189
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,618
   to be able to land on water  

190
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,353
    or skis to land on snow.    

191
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,088
     some are made of metal,    

192
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,858
       and others of tube       
    and fabric construction.    

193
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:40,098
     a bush plane starts out    
      as a design on paper.     

194
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,766
     this company handcrafts    

195
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,036
        four-seater tube        
      and fabric models --      

196
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,638
        the tubes forming       
    the airplane's skeleton,    

197
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,874
      the fabric, its skin.     

198
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,913
   welders construct a tubular  
     frame for the fuselage,    

199
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,515
     the plane's main body.     

200
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:59,251
     the tubes are chromoly,    
         a type of steel        

201
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,853
     that contains chromium     
         and molybdenum,        

202
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,724
     which makes it stronger    
      than standard steel.      

203
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:10,796
  machinists make the aluminum  
     fuel-tank components...    

204
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,531
  and prepare the landing gear. 

205
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,802
     here, they're threading    
 the axle for the tail wheel -- 

206
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,937
      a small, rugged wheel     
          at the back,          

207
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,940
 which helps steer the airplane 
         on the ground.         

208
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,481
    the landing gear consists   
       of this tail wheel       

209
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,151
      and two bigger wheels     
          at the front.         

210
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,088
       they all have large      
       low-pressure tires,      

211
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,125
 which enable the plane to take 
 off and land on rough terrain. 

212
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,165
  workers spray aluminum pieces 
      called ribs and spars     

213
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,568
   with anti-corrosion paint,   
    then rivet them together    

214
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,772
 to build the internal structure
          of the wings.         

215
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,909
using a crimping tool, they make
  tiny indentations in the ribs 

216
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,911
    to perfect the alignment.   

217
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,848
    then they rivet on a skin   
       of aluminum panels,      

218
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,983
   about 1/50 of an inch thick  
         in most areas.         

219
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,987
    they construct the wing's   
         hinged surface,        

220
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,524
           the flaps,           
   and ailerons the same way.   

221
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,328
 the factory's paint shop sprays
 the wings, flaps, and ailerons 

222
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,863
       with highly durable      
         urethane paint,        

223
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,067
     and the fuselage frame     
     with powder-coat paint,    

224
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,003
     which is then baked on     
     for extra durability.      

225
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,473
   now for the meticulous job   
  of applying the fabric skin.  

226
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,209
          the material          
  is heat-shrinkable polyester, 

227
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,878
          commonly used         
    in the aircraft industry    

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,616
 because it's thin, lightweight,
    and exceptionally strong.   

229
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:41,086
    workers brush an adhesive   
    similar to contact cement   

230
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,621
    onto the painted tubing,    

231
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,622
     then adhere the fabric,    

232
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,726
    working around the frame    
       section by section.      

233
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,633
        once the fuselage       
     is completely covered,     

234
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,769
       they run a hot iron      
        over the fabric.        

235
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,705
      this shrinks it taut      
      around the framework.     

236
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:04,175
 after letting the adhesive dry 
     for a couple of hours,     

237
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,644
   they take strips of fabric,  

238
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:08,113
         coat them with         
   a urethane-based adhesive,   

239
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,048
    and reinforce the seams.    

240
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,323
   it's the same construction   
process for the tail components.

241
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,195
  at the front of the fuselage  
  now, they install the pedals, 

242
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,732
  which control both the brakes 
         and the rudder,        

243
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,134
      which moves the tail      
      from right to left.       

244
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,336
        then the cockpit        
        instrument panel,       

245
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:34,205
    a thin sheet of aluminum    
    with laser-cut openings     

246
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,741
             for all            
   the flight instrumentation.  

247
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,677
 next two linked control yokes. 

248
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,145
  they move a series of chains, 

249
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,881
         which maneuver         
       certain components       

250
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,851
       such as the aileron      
       control sprockets.       

251
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,287
  mechanics ran the fuel lines  

252
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,023
     and most of the wiring     
    within the fuselage frame   

253
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:55,827
prior to the fabric application.

254
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,430
        now they install        
   a stainless-steel fire wall  

255
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,766
       between the cockpit      
         and the engine.        

256
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,835
     this seals the cockpit     
    from engine heat, noise,    

257
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,370
       and exhaust gases.       

258
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,242
  after installing the landing  
  gear, brakes, and windshield, 

259
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,912
    workers mount the engine    
       and exhaust system.      

260
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,717
        next the plane's        
       aluminum propeller.      

261
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,453
     other workers are busy     
    installing the fuel tanks   

262
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,655
        inside the wings.       

263
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,657
      the fuselage now goes     
       to the paint shop.       

264
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,928
       when it comes back,      
   workers bolt on the wings,   

265
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,264
 supporting them from underneath
     with steel wing struts.    

266
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,733
    the wings on a bush plane   

267
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:38,002
are positioned higher than those
   on other types of aircraft   

268
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,739
        to give the pilot       
    better ground visibility.   

269
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,943
        after rigging up        
       the flight controls      

270
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,880
   and installing the interior  
trim, workers install the doors,

271
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,751
       plexiglas windows,       
      and cockpit seating.      

272
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:55,353
  each bush plane is inspected  

273
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,956
         at every stage         
   of the production process.   

274
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,223
      when it's completed,      

275
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:03,027
   it undergoes a nose-to-tail  
        final inspection.       

276
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,098
    and then a company pilot    
 takes it out for a test flight.

277
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,986
   narrator: a serious cyclist  
   won't pedal just any bike.   

278
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,990
 it's got to have wheels made of
 strong-yet-lightweight material

279
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,526
      such as carbon fiber      
          or aluminum.          

280
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,729
     advanced bicycle wheels    
     have tubing and spokes,    

281
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,532
    shaped as aerodynamically   
           as possible          

282
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,567
    to lower wind resistance.   

283
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,741
 these elite-level racing wheels
      are made of aluminum.     

284
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,544
        they're designed        
    to generate a smooth ride   

285
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:56,481
  with optimum responsiveness   
  to the rider's acceleration.  

286
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,283
    the starting material --    

287
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,086
      long, straight tubes      
      of extruded aluminum,     

288
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,355
            preshaped           
    with a wheel-rim profile.   

289
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:09,027
 workers load one extruded tube 
 at a time into a metal bender. 

290
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,896
   the machine coils the tube   
       around and around,       

291
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,332
  forming four connected rims.  

292
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,042
         after measuring        
     to ensure the diameter     

293
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,778
  is exactly what it should be, 

294
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,514
    they mount the coil tube    
         onto a cutter.         

295
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:35,353
  with a single downward slice, 
   it separates the four rims.  

296
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,860
they fuse the cut ends later on.

297
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:47,131
   first the rims need a bath   
       in a tank of acid.       

298
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,134
     the acid removes dust      
     and other contaminants     

299
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,269
     and etches the surface     
          of the metal,         

300
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,606
    both of which help ensure   
          full adhesion         

301
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,875
  of the anti-corrosion coating 
        they later apply.       

302
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,878
        next a multiphase       
     heat-treatment process.    

303
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,815
        this restructures       
     the aluminum molecules,    

304
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,751
     making the metal harder    
          and stronger.         

305
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,420
     they join the two ends     
           of the rim           

306
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,556
         by riveting on         
   an aluminum connector tab.   

307
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,427
    then they weld the joint    
        to reinforce it.        

308
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,833
         using a sharp,         
     vibrating cutting tool,    

309
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,769
    a computer-guided machine   
      smooths the weld line     

310
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,305
  until it's nearly invisible.  

311
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,141
       this makes the rim       
        appear seamless.        

312
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,180
          now for that          
     anti-corrosion coating.    

313
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,583
           the process          
     is called anodization.     

314
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,186
           in a tank,           
     they plate the aluminum    

315
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,654
   with a protective chemical,  

316
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,988
   using an electrical charge   

317
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,591
  to draw the coating particles 
      onto the rim surface.     

318
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,531
         for this model,        
 the anodized coating is black. 

319
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,802
            however,            
there are several color choices.

320
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,670
 next a computer-guided machine 

321
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,474
   shaves off a minute amount   
        of anodized metal       

322
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,042
       from nearly a third      
       of the rim surface.      

323
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,612
     this creates a smooth,     
       perfectly flat area      

324
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,549
   for the brake pads to grip.  

325
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,417
the next computer-guided machine

326
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,954
          drills holes          
 for the tiny aluminum nipples, 

327
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:18,757
 which hold the aluminum spokes 
           to the rim.          

328
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,496
          now it's time         
    to assemble the wheel --    

329
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:29,100
   a manual task entrusted to   
specialized bicycle technicians,

330
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,369
         as it requires         
    a level of craftsmanship    

331
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,305
     no machine can perform.    

332
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,441
      the first technician      
 inserts a spoke into each slot 

333
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,178
 of a carbon-fiber-and-aluminum 
            flange --           

334
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,914
         part of the hub        
   at the center of the wheel.  

335
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,050
        once every spoke        
is in its respective spoke seat,

336
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,586
         as it's called,        

337
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,789
       he sandwiches them       
      with a locking ring.      

338
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,059
       now for the rim end      
         of the spokes.         

339
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,796
       the next technician      
    places a small steel plug   

340
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,166
      inside a spoke nipple     
      to make it magnetic.      

341
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,471
    then she puts the nipple    
          into the rim,         

342
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,275
      and, using a magnet,      
    draws it to a spoke hole,   

343
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,545
      then through the hole     
 toward the inside of the wheel.

344
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,080
 then she removes the steel plug

345
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,517
    and inserts the free end    
   of a spoke into the nipple.  

346
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,625
    she repeats the procedure   
      for each spoke hole.      

347
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,994
          this is known         
      as lacing the wheel.      

348
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,170
       the next technician      
     holds each spoke steady    

349
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,841
   while tightening its nipple  
      with a spoke wrench.      

350
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,309
     tightening the nipple      
     straightens the spoke.     

351
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,712
    the process of perfectly    
       aligning the wheel       

352
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,382
  by straightening every spoke  
  is called trueing the wheel.  

353
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,753
      this gauge tells him      
when the wheel is finally trued.

354
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,723
 for quality-control assurance, 

355
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,259
      this robotic machine      
      inspects each spoke       

356
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,829
     and makes any necessary    
     tensioning adjustments.    

357
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,138
    depending on the model,     
    a high-end bicycle wheel    

358
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,740
        can have anywhere       
      from 10 to 46 spokes.     

359
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,278
        different spokes        
      for different folks.
