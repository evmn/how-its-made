00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,625
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,694
fiberglass boats...

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,228
clothes driers...

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,763
bubble gum...

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,033
and fireworks.

8
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,507
they're sleek, they're fast, and they're fun.

9
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,977
fiberglass boats can jump waves
and turn on a dime.

10
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,179
the fiberglass body is low-maintenance and durable,

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,449
so these watercraft don't deteriorate

12
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,651
the way wooden boats can.

13
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,861
a computerized saw cuts out the wood pieces

14
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,331
they'll use to build the mold for the fiberglass boat.

15
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,417
it takes a team of artisans about 15 months

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,619
to design and build the mold.

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,926
they first construct the frame.

18
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,310
then they construct the shape out of fiberglass.

19
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,044
the mold must be perfect

20
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,049
in order to cast a boat that's free of faults and defects,

21
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,986
so they painstakingly work on the mold's finish in particular,

22
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,588
coating it in a special high-resistance paint

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,060
that will withstand about eight years of castings.

24
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,661
once they finish the mold,

25
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,931
they can begin casting the fiberglass boat.

26
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,867
the equipment feeds just the right ratio

27
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,002
of fiberglass to plastic resin.

28
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,674
fiberglass is glass in the form
of very fine, flexible fibers.

29
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,343
they may look fragile,

30
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,212
but those fibers are stronger than steel,

31
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,082
and they won't burn, stretch, or rot,

32
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,085
so they make perfect boat-building material.

33
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,820
workers make sure they roll the fiberglass

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,756
into every nook and cranny.

35
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,758
this is critical

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,761
because if they don't apply the fiberglass thoroughly,

37
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,763
the boat will have structural defects.

38
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,834
as heat within the fiberglass builds up, it hardens.

39
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,710
next, they roll on a material called roving.

40
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,580
it reinforces the fiberglass and makes it more rigid.

41
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,982
they also install wood

42
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,118
in the areas where they'll later mount equipment.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,187
they coat the wood with fiberglass

44
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,190
to protect it from moisture.

45
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,866
after about an hour,

46
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,169
it's time to extract the casting
from the mold.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,776
they use a lever system to lift out the hull.

48
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,689
they cut out holes for the mechanics.

49
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,468
then they install the boat's deck.

50
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,848
they install the motor and the electrical wiring

51
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,583
for the mechanics and plumbing.

52
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,790
the boat truly takes shape in the final assembly.

53
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,127
they put together the upper part
of the boat, called the shell,

54
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,130
and the inside, called the liner.

55
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,406
they install the furniture...

56
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,813
certain components are installed by hand,

57
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,315
such as the dashboard.

58
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,487
last stop, quality control --

59
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,492
a series of tests to ensure that
all the mechanics function well

60
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,262
and that the boat is absolutely watertight.

61
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,968
finally, a wrapping is added

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,871
to protect the boat during shipping.

63
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,196
narrator: electric cars are cheaper to run

64
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,931
than gasoline-powered cars.

65
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,534
just plug them in to recharge. no fill-up required.

66
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:41,339
but they cost 40% more to buy, which offsets the savings.

67
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,743
battery technology will have to
improve and come down in price

68
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,013
before electric cars can truly take off.

69
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:58,290
clothes dryers were invented in europe in the early 1800s.

70
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,425
the lady of the house would put the clothes

71
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,227
in a metal barrel with holes in it,

72
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,495
then turn it by hand over the fire.

73
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,266
the first electric dryers were invented around 1915.

74
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,439
most of the parts are made from steel

75
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,641
just 3/100 of an inch thick.

76
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:20,712
the factory receives it from the supplier in giant rolls.

77
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,449
they go onto a machine that cuts
sheets about 3 feet long.

78
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,452
using those sheets,

79
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:31,122
industrial presses stamp out various dryer parts.

80
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,058
these are motor supports.

81
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,196
and this is the back panel of the drum,

82
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,665
the rotating compartment that holds the clothes.

83
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:45,203
note those small holes. we'll come back to them shortly.

84
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,205
to form the side of the drum,

85
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,342
the machine bends a sheet of prepainted steel

86
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,211
into a circular shape.

87
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,079
when a clothes dryer operates,

88
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,550
it sucks in outside air through a hole at the front.

89
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,752
the air passes through the heating element

90
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,286
and goes into the drum,

91
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,823
entering through those little holes you saw a few moments ago

92
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,392
located in the back panel.

93
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,964
once the automated machines have finished shaping the drum,

94
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,967
they form a groove on its outside surface.

95
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,805
this groove is for the motorized
belt that drives the drum.

96
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,776
next, they put the drum on another machine

97
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,980
that screws three baffles in place.

98
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,917
baffles are those thick plastic
wings located inside the drum.

99
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,787
they're what throw the clothes around as it rotates.

100
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,994
back on the automated line, the drum's front rim goes on.

101
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,171
they manually assemble the drum's back panel.

102
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,253
then a machine installs it.

103
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,360
next comes the exhaust duct.

104
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,763
hot, moist air exits the drum through a series of holes

105
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,899
and a large slot in the dryer door.

106
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,902
the air gets channeled downward
through the lint screen,

107
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,505
then goes through a duct at the
front of the dryer to the fan.

108
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,041
the fan blows the air out this exhaust duct

109
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,777
at the back of the dryer.

110
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,446
the dryer's heating element

111
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,848
works much like the element in a toaster,

112
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,317
except it consumes a lot more power --

113
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,852
up to 6,000 watts.

114
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,721
the factory receives the steel

115
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,191
and ceramic heating coils ready-made.

116
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,861
workers simply position them on a sheet of galvanized steel.

117
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,011
they also install a temperature
sensor that shuts off power

118
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,814
should something go wrong and cause the dryer to overheat.

119
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,290
in the finishing department,

120
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,693
they coat the dryer with powdered paint

121
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,895
that's heat- and shock-resistant.

122
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,471
then they assemble the bottom and back of the appliance.

123
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,507
they install the motor

124
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,144
that drives both the belt and the fan.

125
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,515
then the exhaust duct goes in.

126
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,853
automated machines prepare the electrical wiring.

127
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,456
they paint and cut the wires...

128
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,262
...then install a terminal on each end.

129
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,735
workers wire the dryers...

130
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,538
then install the drum.

131
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,342
they close up the sides...

132
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:22,020
...screw on the door, then wire up the control panel.

133
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,889
it's connected to a series of gears and switches

134
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,092
that control the dryer cycles.

135
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,295
the model and serial-number sticker

136
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,565
marks the last stop on the assembly line.

137
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,512
narrator: chewing gum dates back
to the ancient greeks,

138
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,581
who chewed resin from trees.

139
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,184
modern chewing gum was patented
in the u.s. in 1869

140
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,587
by -- believe it or not -- a dentist.

141
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,157
in 1928, another american invented bubble gum.

142
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:07,265
bubble gum comes in gumballs of all colors and sizes,

143
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,067
but for blowing bubbles,

144
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,471
nothing beats the chewy, gooey pink stuff in the twist wrap.

145
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:19,143
it all starts with a gum base, the stuff that makes gum chewy.

146
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,013
traditionally, the base came from tree resin.

147
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,484
today it's synthetic -- made of plastics and rubbers.

148
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,953
they pour the gum base into a mixer,

149
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,590
then add color and flavoring.

150
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:43,634
as it begins mixing, they pour in glucose syrup, a sweetener.

151
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,439
because it's liquid, it helps keep the gum base soft.

152
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,114
next, they add dextrose, a powdered sweetener.

153
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,184
they blend the ingredients for about 20 minutes.

154
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,252
the stirring action builds up heat,

155
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,822
which melts everything together.

156
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,551
the mixture is ready

157
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,687
when it reaches the consistency
of bread dough.

158
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,292
they transfer it by cart to a machine called the pre-extruder.

159
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,431
the machine squeezes the mixture
through a narrow opening,

160
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,100
like squeezing toothpaste from the tube.

161
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,837
this transforms the big, bulky wad into thin, manageable strips

162
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,473
that can then go through the extruders.

163
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,312
the extruders squeeze each strip

164
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,783
down to the actual width of a piece of bubble gum.

165
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,186
it comes out as one long, continuous stream,

166
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,356
to be cut into bite-size pieces
later on.

167
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,194
this extrusion process heats up
the gum.

168
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,995
if they were to cut and wrap it now,

169
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,330
it would stick to the wrapper,

170
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,999
so the next stop is a cooling chamber.

171
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,068
the gum goes in for 15 minutes

172
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,339
at temperatures between 37 and 45 degrees fahrenheit.

173
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,149
when the bubble gum comes out,

174
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:42,487
it's cooled down enough for what
they call the "cut and wrap."

175
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,823
one machine does both jobs

176
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,492
in a fraction of a second.

177
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,029
watch the action in slow motion.

178
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,299
as the continuous stream of gum
enters on one end,

179
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,101
the machine cuts it into bite-size pieces,

180
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,505
pushes each piece into a wax-paper wrapper,

181
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,875
then twists both ends of the wrapper closed.

182
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,526
here's the slow-motion replay from a different angle.

183
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:39,677
the machine processes 900 pieces
of bubble gum per minute.

184
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,824
last stop -- packaging.

185
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,893
the bubble gum moves onto a scale

186
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,963
that automatically weighs out the right amount per tub.

187
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,709
they seal the tub with plastic to make it airtight.

188
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,045
this keeps the bubble gum fresh.

189
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,448
ever wonder why bubble gum is pink?

190
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,919
it's because that's the only color walter diemer had on hand

191
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:24,255
when he invented this treat back in 1928.

192
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,992
since then, the color just stuck.

193
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,937
narrator: what's a 4th of july celebration without fireworks --

194
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,472
brilliant colors exploding in the air,

195
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,274
the oohs and ahhs they elicit on the ground?

196
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,744
fireworks are so high-tech these days,

197
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:50,581
it's easy to forget they're not a modern invention.

198
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,290
historians believe gunpowder,

199
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,359
the explosive ingredient in fireworks,

200
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:05,162
was invented in china around 1000 a.d.

201
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,265
it's said that in a famous battle,

202
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,034
the chinese emperor illuminated
the sky with it,

203
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,237
scaring away the enemy.

204
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,705
during the renaissance,

205
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,309
the europeans invented the type
of fireworks we know today.

206
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,113
modern pyrotechnicians

207
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,916
use computers to ignite fireworks from a safe distance

208
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,087
and to synchronize their bursts
with music.

209
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,868
assembling explosives into fireworks

210
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,404
is the job of the pyrotechnician.

211
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:51,676
even the tiniest spark of static
electricity could set them off,

212
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,812
so antistatic gloves are a must.

213
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,280
a firework is made up

214
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,017
of separate compartments within a shell.

215
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,553
the burning fuse explodes one compartment at a time,

216
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,290
creating those staggered bursts
in the sky.

217
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:09,560
the pyrotechnician first glues the main fuse

218
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,496
into the bottom of the shell.

219
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,631
the glue is naturally colorless.

220
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,935
it's dyed blue so he can tell exactly where he's applying it.

221
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,576
he puts the bottom aside to work
on the second compartment

222
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,512
of this 2-compartment firework.

223
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:32,050
he starts by spooning a powdered
explosive into the center.

224
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,591
then he caps it.

225
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,694
here he's working on two fireworks at a time.

226
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,136
next step -- a brown cardboard shock absorber

227
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:56,140
to shield this compartment from the first compartment explosion.

228
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:00,812
then a corrugated cardboard disk
and a plastic spacer.

229
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,947
it'll take the fuse 1 1/2 seconds

230
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,283
to burn through these two components,

231
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,285
creating a slight delay

232
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,354
between the first explosion and the second.

233
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,424
gluing the second compartment together is tricky.

234
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,360
if it's too tight, it'll stifle the explosion,

235
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:20,030
but it has to be tight enough to withstand the delay.

236
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,233
with the second compartment done,

237
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,502
it's time to prepare the first.

238
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,037
he glues a sleeve onto a case,

239
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,041
then fills it with hundreds of stars.

240
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,110
stars are what create the flashes of color.

241
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,513
they're carefully measured explosives

242
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,247
mixed with coloring agents

243
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,784
such as magnesium for white, copper salts for blue,

244
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,653
and charcoal for orange.

245
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,990
the pyrotechnician must handle them gingerly,

246
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,593
or they could detonate.

247
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:53,164
next, he adds comets, another type of exploding decoration.

248
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,072
he tops it off with gunpowder.

249
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,221
finally, he glues the two compartments together,

250
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,956
filling the remaining space

251
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,526
with the same combination of ingredients.

252
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,576
once the shell is full, he glues on the cover,

253
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,445
and the tighter, the better.

254
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,381
the more pressure that builds up,

255
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,784
the bigger and more spectacular
the explosion.

256
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,323
next, he wraps the fireworks in craft paper.

257
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,726
the label uses international color codes

258
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,262
to indicate the size of the shell.

259
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,131
the lift charge --

260
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,067
a gunpowder bag with a long, fast-action fuse --

261
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,536
goes at the base of the shell.

262
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,706
that's what'll send the firework
into the sky.

263
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,082
when they light the main fuse at the top,

264
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,752
it simultaneously lights two secondary fuses --

265
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,288
the time-delay fuse inside the shell,

266
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,357
running through the compartments
of explosives

267
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,293
and that long fuse running along the outside

268
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,729
down to the lift charge at the base.

269
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,175
once the lift charge ignites,

270
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:48,845
heat and gas build up inside the
launch tube until they explode,

271
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:53,284
propelling the firework close to 1,000 feet skyward.

272
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,688
let the light show begin.

273
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,336
if you have any comments about the show,

274
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,072
