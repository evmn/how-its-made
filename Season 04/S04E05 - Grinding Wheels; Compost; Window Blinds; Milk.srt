00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,758
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,861
      ...grinding wheels...     

3
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,499
          ...compost...         

4
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,471
       ...window blinds...      

5
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,710
          ...and milk.          

6
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,188
   a grinding wheel is a tool   
   used to grind down, polish,  

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,857
        or cut materials        
     such as metal or glass.    

8
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,060
         like a sander,         
     it uses abrasive grains    

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,464
    to wear away the surface    
      in minute particles.      

10
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,800
       grinding actually        
       sharpens the wheel       

11
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:12,337
  by breaking apart the grains  
 and creating new sharp points. 

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,277
    a grinding wheel is made    

13
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,812
      from several chemical     
    and mineral ingredients.    

14
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,347
       the formula varies       

15
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,083
   according to what the wheel  
   will be intended to grind,   

16
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,751
         polish, or cut.        

17
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,219
         for metalwork,         

18
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,290
       they use abrasives       
 that are aluminum-oxide based. 

19
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:35,026
   for cutting cement, stone,   
   and other nonmetal objects,  

20
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,030
       they use abrasives       
 that are silicon-carbide based.

21
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,365
           even within          
      those two categories,     

22
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,167
    the formulas will differ.   

23
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,236
 a wheel designed for hard steel

24
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:48,506
 will be different than a wheel 
   designed for softer metals.  

25
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,974
   computer-programmed scales   

26
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,711
    automatically weigh out     
    the various ingredients,    

27
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,781
      including additives       
      such as iron oxide --     

28
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,117
       for wheels that cut      
        or grind iron --        

29
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,121
    and the mineral cryolite,   
 which lubricates the abrasives.

30
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:06,191
 powdered and liquid resins bond
  all the ingredients together. 

31
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,460
the powdered resin and additives

32
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,396
    are the first ingredients   
      to go into the mixer.     

33
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,006
      after about a minute,     

34
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,676
          the abrasives         
     and liquid resin go in.    

35
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,545
      another five minutes      
          of churning,          

36
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:30,816
     and the mixture is the     
 consistency of damp beach sand.

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,291
         they screen out        
       any globs or chunks      

38
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,761
  so that the mix has a smooth  
        and even texture.       

39
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,698
    a device called a shuttle   

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,034
       spreads the mixture      
    into a wheel-shaped mold.   

41
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,704
     the diameter and depth     
       of the mold cavity       

42
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,573
  corresponds to the dimensions 

43
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:58,177
         of the specific        
      grinding-wheel model.     

44
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,978
     at the base of the mold    

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,949
     is a reinforcement disc    
       made of fiberglass.      

46
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,544
  next, a galvanized-steel ring 

47
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,747
       goes in the center       
         of each wheel.         

48
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,417
     its four small anchors     
        grip the mixture.       

49
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,953
      this ring is designed     
      to protect the shaft      

50
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,156
 that spins the grinding wheel. 

51
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,499
        a hydraulic press       
   now compacts the material,   

52
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,970
  applying up to 5,000 pounds   
  of pressure per square inch.  

53
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,507
        that's the weight       
        of about 30 cars.       

54
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,845
   every single grinding wheel  
       coming off the line      

55
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,550
  is weighed to ensure it meets 
     design specifications.     

56
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,794
next, the wheels go into an oven

57
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,130
        whose temperature       
         rises gradually        

58
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,132
     from 70 to 390 degrees     
           fahrenheit           

59
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,737
   over a period of 24 hours.   

60
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,538
      this cures the resin,     

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,074
   bonding all the ingredients  
            together.           

62
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,343
    when the grinding wheels    
            come out,           

63
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,312
     they're hard as a rock.    

64
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,086
 the last step of the production
      process is labeling.      

65
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,689
     the automated machinery    
        moves the wheels        

66
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:55,227
     from station to station    
         using suction.         

67
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,429
     it applies eight drops     
 of hot glue around the center, 

68
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,699
 then slaps on the first label. 

69
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,301
         the label bears        
     the manufacturer's logo    

70
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,904
 and lists the grinding wheel's 
           dimensions,          

71
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,374
        its intended use,       
   and the maximum spin speed.  

72
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,976
          the equipment         
      then flips each wheel     

73
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,913
    and glues a second label    
      onto the other side.      

74
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,983
        this label lists        
     the safety information.    

75
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,119
the diameter of a grinding wheel

76
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,055
     can range from 2 inches    
     to more than 20 inches.    

77
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,592
            it can be           
    just .04 of an inch thin    

78
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,862
   or up to 1/2 an inch thick.  

79
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,066
the smallest wheels are designed
 for things like auto-body work 

80
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,068
     while the largest ones     
 can cut through railway tracks 

81
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,172
         and thick-metal        
       construction beams.      

82
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,482
    narrator: many gardeners    
      are relying on nature     

83
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,283
    to nurture their gardens.   

84
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,086
        they're choosing        
    compost-based soil mixes    

85
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,422
         over chemically        
        fertilized mixes.       

86
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,425
      compost is decomposed     
         organic matter.        

87
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,294
         not only is it         
    environmentally friendly,   

88
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,232
  it's chock-full of nutrients  
  and useful micro-organisms.   

89
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,772
           composting           
  is the ecological alternative 

90
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,909
      to burning or burying     
         organic waste.         

91
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,778
      it all starts at this     
       composting factory       

92
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
     with manure from farms,    

93
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,117
    biodegradable solid waste   
        from paper mills,       

94
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,120
 and grass clippings and leaves 
     from local governments.    

95
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,323
 some materials arrive in bulk, 

96
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,126
 others in plastic garbage bags.

97
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,270
    workers carefully inspect   
 the leaves and grass clippings,

98
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,806
          removing any          
    nonbiodegradable objects    

99
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,608
    that got into the bags --   

100
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,811
 things like pieces of plastic, 
        rubber, or metal,       

101
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:56,481
shards of glass, or even stones.

102
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,418
         after combining        
   all the waste ingredients,   

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,624
   they add bulking materials   
   such wood chips and bark.    

104
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,561
   then they stack the mixture  
 in outdoor piles to decompose. 

105
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,098
        the mix's makeup        
     is by no means random.     

106
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,300
  it's scientifically designed  

107
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:20,238
 to create an ideal environment 
    for live micro-organisms.   

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,442
 billions of bacteria and fungi 
       grow and reproduce,      

109
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,445
     feeding on the nitrogen    
           and carbon           

110
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,848
   that are naturally present   
     in the organic matter.     

111
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,584
    they slowly and gradually   
       transform the waste      

112
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,120
into compost, which, when ready,

113
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,989
      will look like rich,      
          black earth.          

114
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,858
    all this microbiological    
            activity            

115
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,463
   heats the waste piles to a   
steaming 150 degrees fahrenheit,

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,133
   even in the dead of winter.  

117
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,469
   the factory turns the piles  
     monthly to aerate them.    

118
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,138
      this stimulates decay     

119
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,209
  and ensures it occurs evenly  
      throughout the pile.      

120
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,613
   the active-breakdown phase   
      takes 6 to 10 months.     

121
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,481
    a curing phase follows --   

122
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,017
          an additional         
      six to eight months,      

123
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:10,222
       at the end of which      
     the compost stabilizes.    

124
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,558
    because the outdoor piles   
  are exposed to precipitation, 

125
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,695
high concentrations of nitrogen,
   phosphorous, and potassium   

126
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,898
  leech into the runoff water.  

127
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,633
    drainage ditches collect    
      and carry this water      

128
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,302
        to holding ponds.       

129
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,772
   from there it goes through   
       a treatment system       

130
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:32,376
  consisting mainly of aeration 
       and settling ponds.      

131
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,712
as we see in this demonstration,

132
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,250
  they aerate the water and add 
   certain chemical compounds.  

133
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:41,386
       the pollutants bond      
    and settle at the surface   

134
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,388
       to be skimmed off.       

135
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,524
  the treated water has to meet 
  strict government regulations 

136
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,061
      before it's released      
      to the environment.       

137
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,864
    back to the compost now.    

138
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,599
 once the curing phase is over, 

139
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,335
    the compost goes through    
       a screening process      

140
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,004
     which removes any lumps    
       or foreign objects       

141
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:04,209
  such as pebbles or partially  
     decomposed wood chips.     

142
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,983
      the finished compost      
     comes out silky-smooth.    

143
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,828
       before the compost       
       is sent to market,       

144
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,499
       it undergoes strict      
    quality-control testing.    

145
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,100
    the factory's laboratory    

146
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,569
        conducts detailed       
        chemical analysis       

147
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,371
      to ensure the compost     

148
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,507
         is at precisely        
   the right level of maturity  

149
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,111
      and that it contains      
the correct balance of nutrients

150
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,982
 and stabilized organic matter. 

151
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,519
         then, a series         
    of growth-chamber tests.    

152
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,121
      to ensure the product     
         performs well,         

153
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,656
    the lab germinates seeds    

154
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,393
      and grows test plants     
     in compost-based mixes.    

155
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,599
    once the quality-control    
           department           

156
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,001
     gives the green light,     

157
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,204
 the compost can be shipped out 

158
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:10,342
either in bulk or packaged bags.

159
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,448
      compost is sold as is     
     or added to soil mixes.    

160
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,884
 it improves the soil structure 

161
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,887
  and actively retains moisture 
        and fertilizers.        

162
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,757
 compost is a chemical-free way 
        to nourish plants       

163
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,827
          and stimulate         
     their defense systems.     

164
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:35,000
 this gives them extra strength 
 to grow fast and stay healthy. 

165
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,577
 narrator: today's window blinds
     come in many styles --     

166
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,512
 roller shades, roll-up shades, 

167
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,048
         pleated shades,        
     and horizontal blinds,     

168
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,984
       to name just a few.      

169
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,719
  the advantage of horizontals  

170
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,921
         is that you can        
      leave the blind drawn     

171
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,924
    and simply tilt the slats   
    to let in tons of light,    

172
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,761
         a bit of light,        
       or no light at all.      

173
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,263
       most manufacturers       

174
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,200
   make their wood horizontal   
      blinds from basswood.     

175
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,202
        it's a hardwood,        
        so it's durable.        

176
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,671
        it's lightweight,       

177
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,139
   so the blind doesn't end up  
         weighing a ton,        

178
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,809
         and it absorbs         
       wood stain evenly.       

179
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,811
 first they feed the rough wood 
        through a planer.       

180
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,349
 they cut it down to 2 inches --
     the width of the slats.    

181
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,552
         then, following        
       a laser guideline,       

182
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,554
    they trim off any excess    
      and square the piece,     

183
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,857
  using a straight-line ripsaw. 

184
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,228
          now the piece         
     goes through a machine     

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,699
  that's specifically designed  
   to cut thin slats of wood.   

186
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,302
     its sharp steel blades     
      slice right through,      

187
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:48,773
    creating up to 15 slats,    
    each .2 of an inch thick.   

188
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,982
  here's the piece of basswood  
    before slicing and after.   

189
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,254
       the slats now pass       
   under an oscillating sander  

190
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,123
   to prep them for staining.   

191
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,126
       after cutting them       
   to the width of the window,  

192
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,329
    workers spray wood stain    
   on both sides of each slat,  

193
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:15,667
      then a coat of sealer     
      to lock in the color.     

194
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,136
     once the sealer dries,     
  they sand the slats manually  

195
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,007
   to prepare them for a final  
   protective coat of lacquer.  

196
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,009
       next, using a die,       

197
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,211
      they punch two slots      
          in each slat          

198
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:31,082
     6 inches from each end.    

199
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,151
          these are for         
   the color-coordinated cords  

200
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,553
  that will operate the blind.  

201
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,755
      now for the assembly.     

202
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,424
  they hang ladder-shaped cords 

203
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,427
       called ladder tapes      
   from the blind's headrail,   

204
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,864
       then slide one slat      
         onto each rung.        

205
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,903
 then they thread the blind cord
 through the slots in the slats,

206
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,373
          hooking it up         
    to the control mechanism    

207
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,842
     hidden in the headrail.    

208
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,577
  a cord dangles down the front 

209
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,313
    for raising and lowering    
           the blind.           

210
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,850
they also mount a wand, or cord,
     for tilting the slats.     

211
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:11,122
     the excess ladder tape     
  is tucked into a bottom rail. 

212
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,990
    to make aluminum blinds,    

213
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,393
   they start with long strips  
       of preformed steel.      

214
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,932
    these will be the blind's   
    headrail and bottom rail.   

215
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,868
        workers cut them        
     to the required length,    

216
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,305
       which is the width       
         of the window.         

217
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,014
 they make holes in the headrail
      for the cord lock --      

218
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,550
 the device that locks the blind
    to the desired height --    

219
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,555
  and the tilter, the mechanism 
     that angles the slats.     

220
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,359
        now they install        
        those components.       

221
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,095
       the cord lock snaps      
     right into the hole --     

222
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,763
      no hardware required.     

223
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,200
          that's known          
       as a pressure fit.       

224
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,872
  they pressure-fit the tilter, 
            as well.            

225
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,779
    next come the tape rolls,   

226
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,315
     through which they run     
        the ladder tapes.       

227
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,658
 they cut the appropriate length
    and color of blind cord,    

228
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,395
         then thread it         
     through the cord lock.     

229
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:28,332
     the tilter turns a rod,    
   which turns the tape roll,   

230
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,203
  which tilts the ladder tapes, 
       angling the slats.       

231
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,405
     and speaking of slats,     

232
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,943
     they're cut from rolls     
    of 1-inch-wide aluminum.    

233
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,280
   workers simply feed a roll   
   into the forming machine.    

234
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,216
  then the rest of the process  
          is automated.         

235
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:49,887
first the machine gives the flat
   metal a semicircular curve.  

236
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,556
   then it punches cord holes   

237
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,426
    and then, as you can see    
 on the far left of the screen, 

238
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,462
       cuts it into slats.      

239
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,035
      but that's not all --     

240
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,437
        this same machine       
    also assembles the blind,   

241
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,375
  sliding a slat onto each rung 
      of the ladder tapes.      

242
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,452
  all that's left to do by hand 

243
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,656
    is thread the blind cord    
  and install the bottom rail.  

244
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:29,160
       from this point on,      
   it's just window dressing.   

245
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,805
            narrator:           
    getting milk out of a cow   

246
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,607
    has sure come a long way    

247
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,210
    since the days of sitting   
on a stool and doing it by hand.

248
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,081
today's cutting-edge dairy farms
      are fully automated.      

249
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,616
     sophisticated equipment    
         feeds the cows,        

250
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,019
     cleans up their manure,    
           milks them,          

251
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,722
         and even checks        
    the quality of the milk.    

252
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,397
     historians aren't sure     

253
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,433
     when humans first began    
      drinking animal milk.     

254
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,169
    they believe that people    

255
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,704
       in ancient babylon,      
        egypt, and india        

256
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,975
       raised dairy cattle      
      as early as 4000 b.c.     

257
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,910
         for centuries,         

258
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,847
         the family cow         
  was the main source of milk.  

259
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,050
      but as cities became      
         more populated,        

260
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:30,187
  keeping your own personal cow 
   became rather impractical,   

261
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,123
        so farmers living       
       outside city limits      

262
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,194
       began to establish       
       dairy businesses.        

263
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:50,207
   the key to good milk output  
         is a good diet.        

264
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,612
  every day, a dairy cow chows  
down up to 100 pounds of feed --

265
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,147
a mix of hay, grass, and grains,

266
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,886
   supplemented with minerals   
   and proteins such as soy.    

267
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,688
          on a hot day,         
  she can drink the equivalent  

268
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,625
   of a bathtub full of water.  

269
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,961
        cows produce milk       
only during the lactation period

270
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,297
          that follows          
      the birth of a calf.      

271
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,233
   starting at 15 to 17 months  
             of age,            

272
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,437
   they're inseminated yearly   
      for about six years.      

273
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,372
    the newborn calf suckles    
      for a couple of days,     

274
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,177
  then goes to a separate area  
          to be raised.         

275
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,479
    but the mother continues    
           to lactate           

276
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,380
  for another 10 to 12 months,  

277
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,251
   producing about 12 gallons   
        of milk per day.        

278
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:38,523
     this is the milk that's    
collected for human consumption.

279
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,592
 the barn floor is automatically
    cleaned around the clock    

280
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,462
       to prevent the cows      
  from walking in their manure, 

281
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,665
   which would spread disease   
         and infection.         

282
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,800
  animal welfare is at the core 

283
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,269
    of this state-of-the-art    
           dairy farm.          

284
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,205
   a happy and stress-free cow  
      produces better milk,     

285
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,944
          so these cows         
   aren't confined to stalls.   

286
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,213
     they walk around freely    
       inside or outside,       

287
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,816
       eating and drinking      
         as they please.        

288
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:09,087
 they scratch themselves against
  this motion-triggered brush.  

289
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,689
           it improves          
     their blood circulation    

290
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,958
     and cleans their hides.    

291
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,894
         each cow wears         
     an identification tag.     

292
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,896
   it emits a low frequency --  

293
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,299
a different one for each animal.

294
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,235
  this enables the computerized 
         milking system         

295
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,171
         to collect data        
  on each cow's milking habits  

296
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,108
           and monitor          
    the quality of her milk.    

297
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,980
   no traditional twice-a-day   
         milking here --        

298
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,383
 the cows decide when they feel 
       like being milked.       

299
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,519
     just like the pressure     
         in our bladders        

300
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,054
     tells us when it's time    
     to go to the bathroom,     

301
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,191
 when the cows find the pressure
 in their udders uncomfortable, 

302
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:51,328
     they just mosey on down    
      to the milking stall.     

303
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,998
      the stall is designed     
      not to force the cow      

304
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,268
     into an uncomfortable      
     or motionless position.    

305
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,136
    it sets up in such a way    

306
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,073
    that she's not separated    
         from the herd.         

307
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:07,344
    scientific research shows   
 that separation induces stress.

308
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,146
         as it prepares         
       to clean her udder       

309
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,748
  with disinfectant and water,  

310
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,484
   the robotic milking system   
       reads the i.d. tag       

311
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,888
    and records that this cow   
         is number 328,         

312
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,992
     coming in for a milking    
    at 4:41 in the afternoon.   

313
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,732
     next, a laser pinpoints    
       the exact location       

314
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,833
 and position of the four teats.

315
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,703
    it feeds that information   
        to the computer,        

316
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,638
   which then guides the robot  

317
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,276
     to attach the teat cups    
           one by one.          

318
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,592
     once the robot detects     
     the presence of milk,      

319
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,526
       extraction begins,       

320
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,596
        each suction cup        
  simulating the sucking action 

321
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,499
       of a nursing calf.       

322
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,204
     a sophisticated machine    
       analyzes the milk.       

323
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,073
 if the quality is not up to par

324
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,743
 or if the machine detects signs
    the cow has an infection,   

325
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,880
 milk with elevated temperature,
   or minute traces of blood,   

326
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,483
    the system automatically    
        rejects the batch       

327
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,919
 and red-flags the problem cow. 

328
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,291
  as the udder-cleaning brushes 
        get disinfected,        

329
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,694
   the robot tracks the output  
    of each teat separately.    

330
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:35,166
that way, no teat is undermilked
         or overmilked,         

331
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,101
         which can lead         
       to health problems.      

332
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,837
 once the suction cups come off,

333
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,173
 the robot disinfects each teat.

334
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,112
    as bessie goes on her way   
    feeling mighty relieved,    

335
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,449
      the robot disinfects      
 the teat cups for the next cow.

336
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,586
 the milk that passes inspection
       collects in a jar,       

337
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,857
then gets transferred to a giant
     refrigerated reservoir.    

338
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:03,126
     they wash out that jar     
          between cows.         

339
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,928
     to keep the milk fresh,    

340
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,065
          they store it         
   at 37 degrees fahrenheit --  

341
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,468
      about the temperature     
      of your refrigerator.
