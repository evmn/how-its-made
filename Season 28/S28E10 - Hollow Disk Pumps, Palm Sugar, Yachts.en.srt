captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,590
narrator: today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,941
and...              

5
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:58,023
many industries require pumping a wide variety of liquids.    

6
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,625
and there are many different kinds of pumps     

7
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,826
that can do that.        

8
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:03,495
one type, the hollow rotary disk pump,        

9
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,866
uses a rotating disk to create sufficient suction   

10
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,700
to move thin or thick liquids         

11
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,170
in a forward or reverse direction.      

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,407
when the pump in the blue runs,              

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,477
a hollow disk inside it oscillates.      

14
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,179
this creates suction,      

15
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,348
drawing liquid into one side of the pump    

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,751
and pushing it out the other.  

17
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,485
some of the pump components are cast             

18
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,087
in sand molds like this one   

19
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,992
for casting the first part of the pump's two-part body.   

20
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,227
the molten iron takes a few hours        

21
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,363
to cool and solidify inside the mold cavity.     

22
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,432
then, a vibrating machine    

23
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:45,004
breaks the sand mold to release the cast part.    

24
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,871
a computer-guided milling machine         

25
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,774
then finishes the shape.     

26
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,308
the cut-off pieces of iron    

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,677
go back into the furnace     

28
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,480
to be melted down for subsequent castings.     

29
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,951
after it's cast,         

30
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,753
the second part         
of the pump's body is machined  

31
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:05,858
to its final shape on a computer-guided lathe.   

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,194
the pump's hollow disk,     

33
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,763
which the lathe machines from a bar of steel,       

34
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,632
requires a complex cut      

35
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,436
that only this electric disk charge machine can perform.            

36
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:20,406
its cutting tool is a gold wire charged      

37
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,409
with a high-voltage current conducted by water.       

38
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,810
guided by a computer,      

39
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,680
the wire erodes the metal in its path,      

40
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:30,682
cutting a teardrop-shaped opening in the disk.       

41
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,818
a laser printer engraves a part number          

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,987
and a batch number on the finished disk.      

43
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,557
to assemble the pump, a worker begins         

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,893
with the first part of the two-part body.      

45
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,596
the worker applies glue to the shaft sleeve and inserts             

46
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,632
it into a channel from the front.         

47
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,438
next, they insert a lantern ring              

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,740
into the same channel from the back.          

49
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:00,579
the worker places a bearing on top of the lantern ring.   

50
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,423
then, from the other side, they insert one more bearing.  

51
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,168
the worker inserts the pump shaft          

52
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,704
through all the bearings in the channel.         

53
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,673
the bearings minimize friction,            

54
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,744
enabling the shaft to rotate smoothly.       

55
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,445
along with this retaining clip,         

56
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,581
the bearings also prevent the shaft            

57
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,650
from moving up and down or shifting side by side     

58
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,421
with the pump's movement.    

59
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,156
workers take the second part of the pump's body        

60
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,525
and glue a bronze plate,     

61
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,296
called a diaphragm, into a groove at the top.    

62
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,932
then they join the two parts of the body,    

63
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,068
placing a gasket in between to prevent leaks.        

64
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,371
the gasket is made of special gasket paper     

65
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,208
like the type used in car engine piping.      

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,715
the workers fasten the two parts of the body    

67
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,483
with 10 massive bolts      

68
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,685
and install a heavy-duty steel spring           

69
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,388
in a groove in the shaft.    

70
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,826
a steel cap keeps the spring firmly in position.       

71
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,927
the worker compresses the spring             

72
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,799
with a tool and inserts a bronze stem bushing.      

73
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,633
this spring loading is critical            

74
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,635
because it enables the disk   

75
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,604
to adapt to thin or thick liquids         

76
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,074
without clogging or getting damaged.       

77
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:40,011
now, they mount the hollow disk onto the bushing      

78
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,347
and bolt on the front cover.   

79
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,916
when the motor turns the pump's shaft,        

80
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,319
the hollow disk oscillates around the diaphragm,      

81
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,822
which acts as a barrier, separating the suction side   

82
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:54,393
of the pump from the discharge side.     

83
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,261
this plate covers where the customer        

84
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,364
will later install a safety valve.     

85
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,367
the oscillating hollow disk produces suction,        

86
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,569
which pulls liquid through the inlet port,     

87
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,540
then out the opposite side, through the outlet port.     

88
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,942
workers mask the inlet and outlet ports         

89
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:14,379
before spray-painting the pump.              

90
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,615
next, the worker installs a metal coupling joint,     

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,518
which is comprised of several parts,        

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,219
including rubber members,    

93
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,155
which make the joint flexible enough         

94
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,589
to withstand some vibration   

95
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,892
or slight misalignment of the connection        

96
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,562
between the pump and the gear reducer.      

97
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,531
the gear reducer acts as the middleman         

98
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,534
between the motor and the pump,          

99
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,470
lowering the motor speed of 1,800 revolutions       

100
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,306
per minute to the disk oscillation speed  

101
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,909
of approximately 300 revolutions per minute.           

102
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,711
such slow rotation speed is critical,        

103
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,816
as it enables the pump to move even very thick fluids.     

104
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,452
the disk can also rotate in reverse        

105
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:57,356
so that liquid can be loaded or unloaded using the same pump.              

106
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,672
narrator: palmyra palm sugar is derived  

107
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,240
from the palmyra palm tree    

108
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,342
and is considered a healthier form of sweetener  

109
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,810
than many others,        

110
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,313
just 41 on the glycemic index  

111
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:25,017
with only 1/10th ounce of fructose per 3 1/2 ounces.  

112
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,985
it's also one of the few plant-based      

113
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,121
sources of vitamin b12.     

114
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,059
palmyra palm sugar doesn't come out         

115
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,427
of the palmyra palm tree     

116
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,028
looking like this.        

117
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,964
from harvesting to processing,          

118
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,099
there are many steps between the tree         

119
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,735
and the ultimate product.    

120
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,506
the tree produces the round fruit seen on the right     

121
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:52,177
and the cylindrical flower cluster on the left.       

122
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,480
a palm sugar harvester prepares specialized containers           

123
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,482
for harvesting the sap      

124
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,319
by threading twine through a hole near the rim.   

125
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,054
these tubes are made from bamboo.        

126
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,824
and in thailand, they're called... [ speaks thai ]    

127
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,796
the harvester adds wood chips to the tubes.          

128
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,565
the wood chips come from the shorea tree,      

129
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,367
[ speaks thai ] in thailand. which is called...       

130
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,471
the chips well help prevent the sap from fermenting.     

131
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:26,277
some palmyra trees are more than 100 years old.     

132
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,946
here, the harvester climbs    

133
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,216
a ladder that reaches up around 66 feet.         

134
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,887
at the top of the tree,     

135
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,989
the harvester uses a machete   

136
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,792
to cut the tip off the palmyra flowers.       

137
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,997
safely on the ground,      

138
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,534
he demonstrates what he does up in the tree.   

139
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,037
he starts by binding together  
two of the cylindrical flowers  

140
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,908
and then carefully trimming off their tips.     

141
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:03,315
where they've been cut, the flowers exude drops of sap,              

142
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,485
which will collect in the bamboo tubes.       

143
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,789
up in the tree, the harvester secures the tubes in place.   

144
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,292
having swapped empty tubes for full ones,          

145
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:19,231
he brings the sap he's collected to an outdoor stove.       

146
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,667
the harvester prepares a basket covered         

147
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,306
with several layers of gauze to filter the liquid.      

148
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,207
he then slowly and carefully   

149
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,409
pours the sap through the filters,       

150
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,078
into the wok below.       

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,081
the harvesting stage is complete.        

152
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,616
production now begins.      

153
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,187
the filtered sap now boils away in the wok    

154
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,589
for approximately 45 minutes   

155
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,792
as it thickens into a sugar.   

156
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,964
the worker takes advantage of the hot oven fire       

157
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:55,500
to sterilize his bamboo tubes.  

158
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,970
he turns them upside-down, one by one,           

159
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,405
over small holes in the oven.  

160
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,943
the worker must harvest twice a day.       

161
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,679
if he doesn't, the cuts will heal over too much.     

162
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,481
and he'll be forced to wait for a specific period of time  

163
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,751
before making additional cuts  

164
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,287
in order to prevent damage to the tree.           

165
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,826
the boiling process thickens the sap.        

166
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,295
and the worker must stir it frequently            

167
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,163
to keep it from sticking.    

168
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:33,004
after roughly 30 minutes, the sap begins to turn white.  

169
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,307
the tubes are now thoroughly sterilized.      

170
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,143
and the worker can remove them and let them cool.        

171
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:44,749
the bubbling sap has now been reduced to a thick substance.  

172
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,520
the worker removes the pan from the heat source.      

173
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:53,358
it's ready for the next phase  
on its path to becoming sugar.  

174
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,094
although it's often referred to as palm sugar,          

175
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,530
it's also known as jaggery.   

176
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,102
the worker now uses a custom-made whisking tool   

177
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,373
to thoroughly mix the jaggery.  

178
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,241
shaped like a large spring,   

179
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:14,512
the whisk helps cool the sugar while mixing it.         

180
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,949
he continues mixing the jaggery until it thickens and cools   

181
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,218
to a paste-like consistency.   

182
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,625
at this point, the jaggery is too thick for the whisk.   

183
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,928
so the worker continues     
mixing it with a simple stick.  

184
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,966
finally, the sugar cools and dries to a thick,      

185
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,435
flaky texture,          

186
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:40,938
ready to be packaged and shipped around the world.  

187
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,575
it has taken nearly a gallon of palmyra palm sap   

188
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,311
to create roughly 2 1/4 pounds  

189
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,648
of this highly nutritious alternative sweetener.      

190
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,699
narrator: the first yachts were simple, sturdy vessels   

191
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,269
used to take explorers on voyages of discovery.     

192
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,339
today's yachts are floating vacation homes.     

193
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,141
equipped with every convenience,          

194
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,411
the luxuries increase with the scale of the vessel.  

195
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,279
modern yachts are the ultimate way         

196
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,248
to explore the coastline.    

197
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,687
if you can afford one of these,             

198
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,522
you're living the dream.     

199
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,856
this motor yacht offers     

200
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:36,094
all the comforts of home on the water.          

201
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:40,831
making this mid-sized yacht starts with a mold for the hull.              

202
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,934
the team sprays a gel-coat paint         

203
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,003
onto the entire inner surface of the mold.           

204
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,642
this paint will transfer to the hull during molding.   

205
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:55,080
they layer fiberglass strips around a p.v.c foam core     

206
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,416
and create a series of distribution channels for resin.             

207
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,418
the crew now drapes an enormous sheet        

208
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,888
of clear plastic        
over the materials in the mold  

209
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,558
and seals the edges with tape.  

210
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,394
the crew leaves a lot of slack in the plastic          

211
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,697
to conform to the mold's deep recesses.   

212
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,735
a vacuum hose suctions out the air beneath the plastic.   

213
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,204
the crew then connects plastic tubing to the ports   

214
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,840
in the distribution channels.  

215
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:27,845
all this plastic tubing leads to one place -- the vacuum pump.              

216
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,982
the vacuum pulls resin     
through the network of tubing,  

217
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,586
into the ports and through the distribution channels.    

218
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,322
the resin saturates the fiberglass strips      

219
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,091
that surround the p.v.c. foam core.      

220
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,528
the vacuum sucks the layers into a tight sandwich      

221
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,699
and pulls out more air and excess resin.        

222
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,669
a worker pulls the plastic away from dry spots          

223
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:53,905
so the resin flows into these areas.        

224
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,573
the resin cures,         

225
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,610
and the fiberglass layers harden.          

226
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,412
the next day, the team removes         

227
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,081
the plastic sheet from the molded part.      

228
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,088
they pull off the resin distribution channels            

229
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,159
and the ports.          

230
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,662
a crane lifts the newly molded hull out of the mold.      

231
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,769
the gel coat has adhered to it, giving it a glossy finish.    

232
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,173
the crane transfers the hull to a wooden cradle.       

233
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,946
next, they create the yacht's deck.        

234
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,381
the crew covers some areas    

235
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,783
of the mold in plastic to protect them         

236
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,987
from the first gel coat in a 2-toned paint job.     

237
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,093
after the first color goes on, they gel-coat the areas     

238
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,929
that had been covered in plastic.       

239
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,466
this two-toned paint job    
is done for aesthetic reasons.  

240
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,502
but it also color-codes the areas            

241
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,638
that have a nonskid texture.   

242
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,711
like the hull, the crew makes the deck mainly from fiberglass.           

243
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,481
a worker cuts out the strips in different sizes.       

244
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,417
the fabrics have various thicknesses and weaves,             

245
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,489
all geared to the deck's structural requirements.     

246
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,791
he numbers the pieces to designate their placement   

247
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,660
in the mold.           

248
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,063
and the worker stacks them sequentially.          

249
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,735
after arranging some of the fiberglass strips     

250
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,036
in the mold,           

251
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,239
the crew builds up the deck in certain areas         

252
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,109
using pieces of balsa wood.   

253
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,111
balsa wood is extremely lightweight.      

254
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,513
but it will add strength     

255
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:45,016
when laminated into the fiberglass sandwich.     

256
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,118
the strategic placement of the balsa wood        

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,221
in high-traffic areas creates a solid core       

258
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,257
that will hold up to heavy use.              

259
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,995
a worker lays more fiberglass strips,     

260
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,431
encapsulating the balsa wood.  

261
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,833
they'll laminate the layers   

262
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,102
with resin the way they did with the hull.     

263
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,340
the crew also makes the roof structure the same way.              

264
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,010
a boat builder applies putty to the fiberglass     

265
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,379
to even out any irregularities.         

266
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,517
and after grinding the hardened putty smooth,    

267
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,621
they spread polishing compound 
on all the yacht's body parts.  

268
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,492
the worker buffs the fiberglass           

269
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,495
until the glossy surface gleams even more.        

270
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,302
using a router, the crew cuts out holes for lights,      

271
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,705
portholes and other features.  

272
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,875
an inspector taps the fiberglass           

273
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,211
to check for air voids that would compromise      

274
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,913
the yacht's structural integrity.            

275
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,083
he confirms that everything is shipshape.     

276
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,786
production now moves to the yacht's interior.     

277
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,423
we'll have the inside information coming up.      

278
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,071
narrator: a motor yacht is a home away from home.      

279
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,441
it's usually equipped with a full kitchen,       

280
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,775
one or more bathrooms,      

281
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,978
and luxurious common areas called salons.          

282
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,346
everything is designed to fit  

283
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,150
into the limited space below deck.           

284
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,484
the waters may get rough.    

285
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,086
but in the yacht's private quarters,        

286
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,655
the living is easy.       

287
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,358
with the bulkheads now in place,          

288
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,428
the hull is ready for furnishings and fittings.  

289
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,330
a computerized router cuts american cherry wood       

290
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,366
to a set of exact measurements.          

291
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,971
this particular piece will be part of a storage locker.    

292
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,139
at another station, a craftsman glues        

293
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,710
a dozen cherry strips together for a valence.     

294
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,012
these laminated strips will be easier          

295
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,849
to bend to the desired shape than a thick board.       

296
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,519
he wraps them in wax paper to prevent the glue       

297
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,422
from seeping out during bending.         

298
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,624
the team places the laminated strips       

299
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,027
between the two parts of a bending jig.        

300
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,199
they clamp the jig to close it tightly.       

301
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,636
the adhesive sets overnight.   

302
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,671
and the wood hardens to the curved shape       

303
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,542
of the bending jig.       

304
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,544
the woodworker now clamps the valence           

305
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,048
to the workbench to steady it as he trims the edges.      

306
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,852
he positions a template on the valence          

307
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,354
and follows it with a router          

308
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,891
to cut out a hole for an air-conditioning vent.  

309
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,426
yes. the yacht will be equipped    

310
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,695
with air conditioning.      

311
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,335
the woodworker inserts the custom            

312
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,371
wooden vent in the hole.     

313
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,810
turning now to the salon's coffee table,    

314
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,744
a router cuts holes in the cherry wood        

315
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,549
while bristles keep the dust down.       

316
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,651
a worker applies glue      

317
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,454
and inserts pieces of maple into the cutouts.        

318
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,890
he lightly hammers the pieces  

319
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:16,394
to drive them further into the holes.         

320
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,897
then, it's into an automated sander.       

321
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,668
it sands the inlaid wood flush to the cherry tabletop.  

322
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,775
a crew now brushes varnish onto all the wood pieces.    

323
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,111
the varnish enhances the wood grain.         

324
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,046
and it protects the surface.   

325
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,550
after the varnish dries,     

326
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:43,054
another worker polishes the wood to a high sheen.    

327
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,959
a worker then screws pedestal hardware        

328
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,527
into the back of each table   

329
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,397
to prepare them for installation in the yacht.    

330
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,835
the hull has been equipped    

331
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,004
with the two diesel engines at the back.           

332
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,842
a worker now assembles the clothing locker       

333
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,778
in the guest stateroom.     

334
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,751
and in the master stateroom,   

335
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:18,522
construction on the en suite bathroom is underway.      

336
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,859
the worker screws the toilet in place       

337
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,429
and connects the water and waste hoses.         

338
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,400
they roughen a utility room   

339
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,069
for a washer and dryer at the back of the yacht,    

340
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,305
next to the mechanical systems.            

341
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,343
the crew situates the propellers          

342
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,079
in the molded niches in the bottom of the hull.    

343
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,714
and the technician connects them          

344
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,883
to swiveling mechanisms called pods.           

345
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,751
he hooks up a pump that will replace        

346
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,821
the lubricating oil when needed,           

347
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:50,989
so there'll be no need      

348
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:53,491
to pull it into port for oil changes.         

349
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,229
the technician installs intake systems     

350
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,798
that will suction lake or ocean water into the hull   

351
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,734
to cool the diesel engines.   

352
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,771
the other mechanics include the air-conditioning system,   

353
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,908
water heater and a generator.  

354
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,977
and now, the big moment.     

355
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,746
using a crane, the crew lowers the yacht's deck         

356
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,149
and pilothouse onto the hull.  

357
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,621
this deck assembly weighs 3 tons.          

358
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,390
looks like it's a good fit.         

359
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,428
using crowbars, the team pulls the rim,     

360
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,799
also known as the flange of the deck, over the hull.   

361
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,802
they drill threaded holes through the fiberglass flange  

362
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,737
and the hull and screw bolts   

363
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,440
into those holes to connect the two.       

364
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,575
special adhesive has been applied    

365
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,577
to these bolts to keep water          

366
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,513
from penetrating the vessel.   

367
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,215
here's the view inside.     

368
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,217
the cherry paneling in the pilothouse        

369
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:57,221
seamlessly matches the paneling in the living quarters.     

370
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,690
the builders complete the furnishings,         

371
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,627
giving the cabin the look and feel of luxury.       

372
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,098
they install a high-end galley kitchen.    

373
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,533
and this yacht is complete.   

374
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:14,238
after 6 months of work, let the good times begin.
