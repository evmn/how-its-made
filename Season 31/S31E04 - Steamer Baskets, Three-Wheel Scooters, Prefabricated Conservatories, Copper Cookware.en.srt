narrator: people have been steaming food for thousands of years.    

10
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,792
once upon a time, steamers were
made out of clay pots     

11
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,994
with perforated floors.    

12
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,263
today, we've come up with all sorts of metal    

13
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,198
and plastic innovations.    

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,068
the traditional bamboo steamer is a perfect balance      

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,170
between the old and the new.          

16
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,941
perfected by generations of craftsmen,         

17
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,944
traditional bamboo steamers are lightweight, strong,    

18
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,546
and durable.          

19
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,748
they look like simple cooking tools,         

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,752
but building them requires enormous artisanal skill.   

21
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,023
the craftsman buys lengths of bamboo from local farmers. 

22
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,226
he uses a traditional planer he crafted himself       

23
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,397
to smooth the bamboo joints.  

24
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,369
a customized chopper tool helps
him split the bamboo lengthwise.

25
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:48,174
he inserts a bamboo stick to hold the split open.    

26
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,910
after removing the chopper, he pulls on the stick     

27
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:53,779
to split            
the entire length of the bamboo.

28
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:59,584
the craftsman splits the sections again.      

29
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,387
to assemble the steamer base, 

30
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,257
the craftsman will split the bamboo into 32 pieces.   

31
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,195
the cover will require 128 pieces.          

32
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:15,233
a custom-made knife knocks down
the intersections of the bamboo.

33
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,736
for the steamer's cover,    

34
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,872
the craftsman splits the bamboo horizontally.    

35
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,946
next, the craftsman uses this slicing tool to cut the wood. 

36
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,350
he sets the desired width   

37
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,620
and slices a thin sheet of wood lengthwise.      

38
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,027
he uses this section of wood to form the base of the steamer

39
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,765
and slides a bamboo ring over it to hold it in place.  

40
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,372
then he punches small holes with a drill...        

41
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:59,011
...and reinforces the joint with stainless steel wire.   

42
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,850
the installation process begins.

43
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,853
first by installing a series of inner rings         

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,190
which will serve to reinforce the structure of the steamer  

45
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:15,794
and to support multiple levels of steamers inside it.     

46
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,464
the craftsman uses special techniques to ensure      

47
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:23,002
that each joint is perfectly aligned for maximum strength. 

48
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:27,339
working almost entirely by hand
with skills acquired over time,

49
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,675
he meticulously creates a strong,           

50
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,278
yet lightweight piece of kitchen equipment.     

51
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:41,153
the basket still needs a bottom
to rest dumplings in.     

52
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,090
the craftsman begins building the basket floor        

53
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:47,959
by custom fitting       
a series of rugged cross pieces.

54
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,764
he ensures that each piece fits
perfectly before proceeding.  

55
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,569
then he inserts thin, more pliable pieces of bamboo 

56
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,039
to hold the cross pieces in place.   

57
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,644
next, he lays the final layer on top,            

58
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,780
placing the pieces with their outer sides     

59
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:11,116
facing up to form a smooth surface for food   

60
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,085
to sit on while steaming.   

61
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,324
with the floor of the steamer in place,           

62
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,326
it's time to secure the upper pieces        

63
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,063
by binding them to the support pieces.     

64
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,003
to do this, he threads a stainless steel wire     

65
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,337
through the cracks,      

66
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,974
twisting the ends tightly to the base.          

67
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,212
then he gives the inner support
rings under          

68
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:44,816
the steamer floor a few taps, securing them in place.    

69
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,453
the basket's base is now complete.           

70
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,959
next, the craftsman begins weaving the bamboo pieces   

71
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,295
together that will form the cover.   

72
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,502
he uses a traditional pattern called a twill weave.     

73
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,540
then he inserts paper before  
adding a second layer of bamboo.

74
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,245
the paper will help prevent steam from escaping

the basket too quickly.    

76
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,318
he then snaps in a series of carefully sized reinforcements 

77
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,387
to keep the layers in place.  

78
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,326
finally, he custom fits another
interior ring         

79
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:30,663
under the reinforcements to hold everything together,  

80
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,198
tapping it carefully into position.

00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:17,755
cast iron has less thermal conductivity than copper,   

303
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,956
so the heat from the pan    

304
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:23,094
will travel more slowly up the handle.     

305
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,497
the craftsperson clamps the handle to the saucepan.  

306
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,968
this holds it tightly in place as he drills rivet holes    

307
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,238
through both the iron handle and the copper pan.      

308
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,441
the craftsman removes the clamp

309
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:41,846
and bolts the handle to the pan temporarily.    

310
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,114
this stabilizes it       

311
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,283
for the drilling of the second rivet hole.   

312
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,190
a rivet is inserted in the second hole       

313
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:55,059
from the inside of the pan.  

314
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,329
the coppersmith heats the tail of the rivet to soften it.   

315
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,869
then the pan is transferred to an anvil.          

316
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,537
using a pneumatic hammer,   

317
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,206
the coppersmith flattens the first rivet,        

318
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,145
removes the temporary bolt, and installs the second rivet. 

319
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,815
he heats the pan over a flame 

320
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:19,818
and melts a tin bar to the bottom.         

321
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,620
he spreads the molten tin up the sides of the pan    

322
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:26,557
using a rag that's been soaked with a flux chemical.  

323
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,426
the flux cleans the copper   

324
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,896
and allows the tin to flow more smoothly.     

325
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,165
the tin lining will prevent acidic foods   

326
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:38,369
from leeching raw copper into the food.         

327
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:43,040
the heat from the tinning flame
has caused some discoloration. 

328
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,509
the coppersmith removes the stains by using      

329
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:49,180
a cotton buffing wheel and polishing compound.    

330
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,515
as he continues,        

331
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,185
the polishing takes the copper to a high sheen.  

332
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,789
this copper saucepan is now ready for the stovetop.    

333
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,858
but first, the craftsman pounds
a steel stamp         

334
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,594
into the bottom of the pan,  

335
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,796
imprinting it with the company logo.     

336
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,800
for cookware that only takes a couple hours to make,    

337
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,669
a copper pan can last for decades.     

338
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:15,774
and if it's well cared for, it won't even show its age.
