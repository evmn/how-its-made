captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,986
narrator: at many work sites,      

4
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,188
grapples do all the heavy lifting.     

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,990
dangling from crane booms,   

6
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,393
these huge mechanized claws move mountains of material   

7
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,128
one load at a time.      

8
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,530
some are equipped with powerful electromagnets  

9
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,333
for gathering small bits of metal      

10
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,001
along with the large ones.   

11
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:17,142
not much can escape the grasp of the mighty grapple.     

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,345
a magnet at the center pulls metal from the scrap heap,   

13
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,815
while four fingers dig into the pile.       

14
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:27,019
it then transfers the load of steel for recycling.    

15
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:30,423
it actually takes some of that recycled steel  

16
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:34,093
to make a grapple in the form of steel plate.  

17
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,162
a computer-guided flame burns through the steel    

18
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,765
to cut out the various part shapes.    

19
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,100
it will take approximately 50 pieces    

20
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,172
in a range of shapes and    
thicknesses to make one grapple.

21
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,245
a press brake repeatedly rams one of the parts        

22
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,849
while an operator adjusts it forward between thrusts.    

23
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,186
the process curls the part to give it a claw-like profile.

24
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:03,122
it's the basic shape of a grapple finger.      

25
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,990
using a template,       

26
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,060
he checks the curvature to confirm it's on target.   

27
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,930
he'll curl four fingers per grapple.          

28
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:15,668
meanwhile, a welder pieces together the grapple's core,  

29
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,004
working within a special fixture

30
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,806
that allows him to assemble it precisely.   

31
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,875
after he tack-welds them together,           

32
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,810
it's over to the robot.    

33
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,211
it does the permanent welds  

34
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,715
as the core slowly rotates in a special device.      

35
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,489
they hoist the welded grapple core over to the magnet    

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,425
and feed its main wire up through the core.      

37
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,959
they lower the core,      

38
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,230
and it fits onto metal dowels protruding from the magnet.  

39
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,099
this allows them to align the two precisely.  

40
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,702
they thread high-strength bolts
into the dowels        

41
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,904
to secure the assembly.    

42
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,309
next, they place a turntable bearing      

43
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,445
on the grapple's top flange.  

44
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:00,979
this bearing is an important part      

45
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,182
of the claw-rotator mechanism. 

46
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,385
they fasten the bearing's outer ring to the flange    

47
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,653
with numerous bolts,      

48
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,722
torqueing each one tightly   
to withstand the spinning action

49
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,992
of the bearing's inner ring.  

50
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,060
as demonstrated here,     

51
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,062
the bearing turns in both directions       

52
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,366
to give the grapple's claw movements a lot of flexibility.

53
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,540
a worker now lowers the upper rotator assembly   

54
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,808
onto the turntable bearing.  

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,877
this assembly holds the rotator's motor      

56
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,746
and the manifold that feeds hydraulic fluid   

57
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,383
to the cylinders that power the claw.      

58
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,222
they now slide the hydraulic cylinders into their slots   

59
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,825
and lock them in place with pivot pins.        

60
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,230
they install a total of four cylinders.       

61
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,632
each one will power one grapple finger,      

62
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:58,637
and together, they'll open and close the grapple claw.  

63
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,574
they connect the hydraulic feed
lines to the cylinders     

64
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,443
and reinforce the connection with a four-bolt flange    

65
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,380
that can handle the pressure of the hydraulic fluid.    

66
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,191
they guide each steel finger into slots in the grapple core 

67
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,593
and align them correctly.   

68
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,332
they slide a pivot pin into the attachment holes   

69
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,801
to link the two.        

70
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,270
this pin will also act as a kind of hinge       

71
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:34,005
as the finger opens and closes.

72
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,074
they fasten the pivot pin to the grapple         

73
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,610
with a nut that's split in one spot.          

74
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,479
this split enables it to be squeezed tightly     

75
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,349
around the large pin with a small bolt.       

76
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,756
they attach the hydraulic cylinders to the claw fingers 

77
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,692
with more large steel pins.  

78
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,899
and they're now ready to power the grapple claw   

79
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,367
and test the gripping action. 

80
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,571
the four tines, or fingers, open and close in unison.   

81
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,174
the tips mate correctly. there's no overlap.      

82
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,109
they roll paint onto the company emblem,    

83
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,747
and this grapple claw is now ready for the jobsite. 

84
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,519
it weighs 4.5 tons,      

85
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,654
and just dropping it on a car 

86
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,590
will crumple it like a piece of tissue paper. 

87
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,665
it takes about 150 hours to manufacture a grapple claw 

88
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,067
that can get a grip on the really big jobs     

89
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,769
in a matter of seconds.    

90
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,022
narrator: whether it's boysenberry in your muffin,  

91
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,623
hazelnut in your coffee,    

92
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,425
blue cheese in your salad dressing,    

93
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,694
or spearmint in your chewing gum,      

94
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,631
the source is usually a prepared flavoring.     

95
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,700
food and drink makers typically
approach a flavorings company 

96
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,037
to custom-design and produce whatever flavor they need.   

97
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,244
not only do flavoring companies
produce ingredients      

98
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:19,578
for commercial use,      

99
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,113
they also manufacture stand-alone flavoring products 

100
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,782
for retail sale,        

101
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,185
such as those syrups you squirt into coffee,    

102
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,420
fountain drinks, and other beverages.      

103
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,661
in the company's research and development laboratory,  

104
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,863
flavor chemists create each recipe,      

105
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,667
drawing from an elaborate arsenal of ingredients.    

106
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,469
if they're designing an orange flavoring, for example,    

107
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,671
they might combine orange essence and orange peel    

108
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,673
with extracts from other citrus fruits,   

109
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,609
tweaking the proportions    

110
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,679
until they achieve exactly the taste they're after.    

111
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,020
this chemist is designing flavoring for a soft drink.  

112
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,290
he pours a specific amount of his trial recipe into water,

113
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,092
then carbonates the mix    

114
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,228
by adding pressurized carbon dioxide.  

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,030
then he bottles the drink   

116
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,399
and sends it to the client for approval.         

117
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,569
once the client gives the okay,

118
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,105
plant technicians mix a production formula,   

119
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,574
following very precise weights and measures      

120
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,310
set out in the recipe.     

121
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,113
once they combine the formula's key ingredients, 

122
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,848
they add them to the liquid fillers --    

123
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,516
such as fruit juice and water --

124
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,719
and solvents such as ethanol. 

125
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,322
the solvents trigger molecular changes   

126
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:39,058
that transform the oil-soluble key ingredients

127
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,126
into a water-soluble state.  

128
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,128
without this conversion,    

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,330
the finished flavoring would simply float on top   

130
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,533
of any liquid to which it's added.      

131
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,136
at several points throughout the process,    

132
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,671
the company's quality-control lab      

133
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,006
performs an array of tests   

134
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,075
to assess color, flavor, viscosity,       

135
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,944
and other characteristics.   

136
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:04,149
the last ingredients to go into the production formula,  

137
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,252
when the recipe calls for them,
are colorings.         

138
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,892
sometimes a client wants a powdered flavoring      

139
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,427
rather than a liquid one.   

140
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,695
so chemists develop a liquid recipe    

141
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,364
that a machine called a spray dryer      

142
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,167
can process into a powder.   

143
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,568
in the production plant,    

144
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,705
workers pour the required quantity of production formula 

145
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,774
into a large processing kettle.

146
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,308
they add whatever additional ingredients     

147
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,110
the recipe may call for,    

148
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,246
and if required, heat the mix. 

149
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,048
if they're making a powdered flavoring,     

150
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,983
then from the kettle,     

151
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,584
they pour the liquid into a mixer          

152
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,321
containing water, gums, and starches.         

153
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:45,123
these keep all the ingredients evenly blended.        

154
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,992
then they open a hatch     

155
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,528
and drop the mix directly into the spray dryer. 

156
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,330
the machine uses high pressure 

157
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,999
to transform the liquid into a fine mist,       

158
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,468
then heat to dry the mist particles   

159
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,103
into powder particles.     

160
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,807
they put the powder      

161
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,809
into a machine called a ribbon blender    

162
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:09,080
and add whatever dry ingredients
the flavoring recipe calls for. 

163
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,885
then mixing blades slowly blend
all the powders together.   

164
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,955
the plant sends a sample from the blender        

165
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,357
to the quality-control lab.  

166
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:19,624
among other tests,       

167
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,293
lab technicians put the sample under a microscope       

168
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,363
to analyze the particle size, 

169
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,701
which indicates how thoroughly the ingredients are blended.  

170
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,303
exiting the ribbon blender,  

171
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:34,639
the finished flavoring passes through a vibrating screen,  

172
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,843
a magnet, and a metal detector.

173
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,446
the packaging equipment weighs a specific quantity   

174
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,850
and dispenses it into cartons lined with polyethylene.    

175
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,319
a suction hose vacuums what dusts up in the process, 

176
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,623
because airborne powder is an explosion hazard.    

177
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,196
the plant sends a sample from every batch it produces  

178
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:58,663
back to the lab.        

179
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:02,534
trained testers smell and taste the sample   

180
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,137
and compare it to the model lab batch.    

181
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,076
the testers flag any production sample     

182
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,278
that's even the slightest bit off the mark,         

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,247
in which case they alert the flavor chemists,      

184
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,417
who then diagnose and fix the problem.      

185
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,419
this procedure,        

186
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,688
along with the various quality-control measures    

187
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,490
throughout the production process,    

188
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,893
ensures taste consistency, which is absolutely critical, 

189
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,697
whether the prepared flavoring is an ingredient        

190
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,765
in a commercially produced food or beverage        

191
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,100
or a retail flavoring     

192
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,770
that you squirt into or sprinkle onto a drink or snack.

193
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,789
narrator: for centuries,    

194
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,460
dog-driven sleds were a lifeline
across the frozen north,    

195
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,395
delivering medicine and other supplies       

196
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,397
to far-flung communities.   

197
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,532
today, aircraft and snowmobiles

198
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,334
have mostly taken over that work,           

199
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,736
and dog-sledding has become a sport.      

200
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,107
and a well-made sled is behind every winning team. 

201
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,680
a dog-sled race is an endurance test for the dogs,

202
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,349
the driver, and the sled itself.

203
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,018
a good sled is both flexible  

204
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,820
and sturdy enough to go the distance.      

205
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:33,224
at this factory, they make sleds from white ash.

206
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,427
a worker angles the ends of vertical bars   

207
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,494
so they can be fitted     

208
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,897
to the sled's top rail and handlebar.         

209
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,433
these bars are called stanchions.     

210
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:42,767
he shapes the other end of them

211
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,070
so they'll fit into grooves in the sled's runner.     

212
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,374
all the parts of this sled are designed          

213
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,644
to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

214
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,648
a worker now screws aluminum rails   

215
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,117
onto the bottom of the two runners.      

216
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,120
he slides plastic strips into those aluminum rails,   

217
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,323
which gives the runners a smooth base         

218
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:07,058
for gliding over ice or snow. 

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,795
he secures the plastic strips at each end with screws.    

220
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,664
the crew is now ready to assemble    

221
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,133
all the pieces of the dog sled.

222
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,136
they attach metal screw eyes to the runners.        

223
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,871
they'll thread rope through them

224
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,874
when they're ready to tie the parts of the sled together.

225
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,410
all the parts of the framework 

226
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,347
fit into notches made specifically for them.  

227
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:31,750
the location of those notches has been precisely mapped out. 

228
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,486
if one is even a fraction of an inch off,        

229
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,690
the sled would collapse like a house of cards.     

230
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,692
they measure the space between the runners      

231
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,228
to confirm they're perfectly aligned,   

232
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,231
and now tie the joints together
with nylon rope.        

233
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,100
these ties are called lashings,

234
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:51,770
and there are 22 of them on this dog sled.       

235
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,973
historically, lashings were made
of moose hide,         

236
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,875
but nylon is tougher.     

237
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,645
they cut the rope with a hot blade,       

238
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,715
which seals the fibers so that they won't unravel.  

239
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,956
they tie the midpoint joints together...          

240
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,328
...and the focus then moves to the dog-sled handlebar.   

241
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,465
a worker glues strips of ash together.           

242
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,802
the strips are thin so they can be easily bent,  

243
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:28,206
allowing him to curl      
the glued layer around a u-form.

244
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,875
he clamps the wood to the form,

245
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,278
and the glue cures for three hours.        

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
it hardens into the u-shape,  

247
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,950
creating the dog-sled handlebar.    

248
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,486
he secures the handlebar to the dog sled        

249
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,488
with the nylon lashings.    

250
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,093
the team then assembles the bed
of the sled.          

251
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,429
they clamp the slats into place,

252
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,700
and then screw them to the framework.       

253
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:58,103
they install the sled's front bumper,    

254
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,839
called the brushbrow.     

255
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,041
next, a worker cuts off    
the metal bead of a bicycle tire

256
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,444
and discards it.        

257
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,315
he uses the remaining tire tread
to create foot pads      

258
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,517
by wrapping it around pieces of thick plastic    

259
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,387
and screwing it into place.  

260
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,589
he installs a treaded pad on each runner         

261
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,692
to keep the driver's feet from slipping off.       

262
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,999
then they install an aluminum bar brake.     

263
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,201
these pivot bolts will allow this bar brake   

264
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,003
to be raised when not needed, 

265
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,740
and lowered to engage the metal talons.       

266
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,945
he loops a bungee cord on each side of a cross bar  

267
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,416
and burns off an end.     

268
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,884
he hooks the other end of the cord to the brake.   

269
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,420
this simple bungee-cord mechanism     

270
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:52,891
will enable the dog-sled musher
to activate the brake.     

271
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,428
he heat-shrinks rubber tubing around the base of the cord  

272
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,963
to protect it.         

273
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,233
they now weave the back of the sled,     

274
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,370
using nylon cord to create a basket for carrying things. 

275
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,974
it's big enough to hold a tired animal.        

276
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,576
the worker then loops and ties the bridle      

277
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,745
to front stanchions beneath the sled.       

278
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,317
he forms a "v" as he threads it

279
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,753
from the back of the sled to the front.         

280
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,394
he paints urethane onto the wood,         

281
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,930
and even over the lashings.  

282
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,733
this will protect them against wear.         

283
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,070
it's taken about three days  

284
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,473
to make this traditional basket dog sled,        

285
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:44,242
and now it's ready to mush.  

286
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,894
narrator: athletic footwear dates back to ancient times,  

287
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,496
but the concept gained traction

288
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,898
with the development of treaded rubber soles    

289
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,301
in the early part of the 20th century.      

290
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,701
these rubber-soled shoes    

291
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,105
were lightweight, comfortable, and hit the ground quietly,  

292
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,708
earning them the name "sneakers."      

293
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,914
design improvements      

294
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,249
have broadened the appeal of athletic shoes.       

295
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,985
people wear them everywhere.  

296
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,788
the athletic shoe       
has definitely gone main street.

297
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,660
using a hydraulic press,    

298
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,463
this employee forces a die through synthetic fabric    

299
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,066
to cut out patterns for the upper part of the shoe.

300
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,072
at the next station,      
he punches out leather toe tips.

301
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,875
the toe tip is one of numerous cut-outs  

302
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,745
that add shape and structure to the synthetic upper.    

303
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,751
after arranging the tip parts on a nonstick tray,      

304
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,888
this worker places strips of thermal resin onto them.  

305
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,293
she drapes a nonstick sheet over the tray,         

306
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,295
then slides it into a hot metal press.    

307
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,399
the resin melts into the leather
to stiffen and strengthen it. 

308
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,940
another worker stamps the model
number onto the heel cutout.  

309
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,177
then it's over to the sewing department,   

310
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,979
where a worker stitches a reflector          

311
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,948
onto the athletic shoe upper. 

312
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,721
other accent pieces call for more intricate stitching,   

313
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,425
so she arranges the parts on a computerized platform.  

314
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,662
the platform moves back and forth,     

315
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,797
allowing the needle to do a perfect job      

316
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,333
of stitching the accent pieces to the upper.         

317
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,637
this stitching would be difficult to execute manually. 

318
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,076
once some of the more substantial pieces       

319
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,611
have been applied to the shoe, 

320
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,080
it's time to sew on a reflective logo,       

321
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,417
and the needle is once again guided by computer software.  

322
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,889
this athletic-shoe upper is now ready          

323
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,291
for its resin-fortified leather toe tip.        

324
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,162
she stitches it in place,   

325
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,898
and then pieces together the collar           

326
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,801
and sews it to the back of the shoe.    

327
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:30,041
she installs thick foam padding
on the inside of the collar,  

328
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,309
and then turns it right-side-out

329
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,146
to tuck the padding      
neatly inside and hide the seam.

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,788
putting on the collar     
has obscured the top lace holes,

331
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,691
so she clears them with a compressed-air punch.  

332
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,863
down the line,         

333
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,732
more computerized needles embroider brand information  

334
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,601
onto the tongue panels.    

335
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,411
the next worker sews a liner and padding to the panel,   

336
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,147
again working inside-out to hide the seam.       

337
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,490
another worker then stitches a fabric base  

338
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,525
onto the athletic shoe.    

339
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,499
she applies a rigid plastic to the heel.          

340
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,871
that adds structure and support
to the back part of the shoe. 

341
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,044
further down the production line,      

342
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:44,249
a worker tugs the shoe onto a foot form called a last.

343
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,584
they heat it to make it malleable enough  

344
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,920
for this machine to pull it to the shape of the last.   

345
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,989
at the same time,       

346
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:56,461
nozzles apply cement to glue the overlap to the fabric base.

347
00:19:56,463 --> 00:20:00,531
then a machine heats both the upper and the rubber sole. 

348
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,134
the heat activates glue applied to the sole earlier  

349
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,104
and also prepares the upper for bonding to that sole.   

350
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:13,945
they initially use manual force
to press the two together,   

351
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,148
and then the shoe is subjected to mechanized pressure.    

352
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,017
inside this machine,      

353
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,886
a rubber bladder expands to force the two together   

354
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,222
for a complete seal.      

355
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,892
the shoe then gets a foam insole
with an arch support.     

356
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,827
the worker laces it partially 

357
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,597
and then pairs it up with the other shoe.      

358
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,804
an inspector examines the pair for defects.          

359
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,975
it has taken about 21 minutes 

360
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:47,846
to make this pair of athletic shoes.       

361
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:51,349
and they should be able to take
a real workout.
