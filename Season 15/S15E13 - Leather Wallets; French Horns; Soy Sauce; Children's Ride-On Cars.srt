   discovery communications

00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:55,187
   narrator: the pocket wallet  
               was              
 invented in the 17th century.  

4
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,189
      europe had switched       
        to paper money,         

5
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,924
   and the gents of the day     

6
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,060
       needed a handy way       
     to pocket their cash.      

7
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,595
  there's a slot for everything 
               --               

8
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,865
      credit cards, i.d.,       
     and, of course, cash.      

9
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,000
     and yet these wallets      
      remain slim enough        

10
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,802
 to fit into a trouser pocket.  

11
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,608
           these fine           
    handcrafted pocketbooks     

12
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,945
    are made from high-grade    
   vegetable-tanned leather.    

13
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,493
   an employee selects a hide   
    and arranges it on a work   
             table.             

14
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:35,894
     then he chooses a die      

15
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,430
     shaped like one of the     
            wallet's            
        inside pockets.         

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,234
  using this hydraulic press,   
   he punches out the part.     

17
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,711
      he cuts 11 different      
           components           
  for the wallet's interior,    

18
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:54,379
   using a custom die for each  
              one.              

19
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,449
   he chooses tougher leather   
    in a contrasting color      

20
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,318
  for the wallet's exterior.    

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,855
 he now measures the thickness  
  of the interior components.   

22
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,858
      using what's called       
      a skiving machine,        

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,394
      he shaves them down       
    to .7 of a millimeter.      

24
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,300
    another worker preheats     
     an embossing machine.      

25
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,603
  it hot-stamps a pocket part   

26
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,873
     with the company name      
  and the royal warrant logo,   

27
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,209
        which signifies         
   that the prince of wales     

28
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,678
    purchases this company's    
        leather goods.          

29
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,883
       using a different        
       skiving machine,         

30
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:34,754
   they shave down the edges    
 of the exterior wallet parts.  

31
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,355
      this thinner border       

32
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:40,025
   will make the parts easier   
      to assemble later.        

33
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,895
    the next worker applies     
    a water-based adhesive      

34
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,897
      to a leather strip.       

35
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:49,602
       it will reinforce        
  the top of a fabric square.   

36
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,773
   with this manual device,     

37
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:57,109
     she turns the top edge     
to fold it in a straight line.  

38
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,845
      this leather-trimmed      
         fabric square          

39
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,314
     will be used to create     
     a credit-card pocket.      

40
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,050
    she stamps a thin groove    
     onto the leather trim      

41
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,886
  to give it some definition.   

42
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:13,726
 next, she builds a credit-card 
 slot with two of the squares.  

43
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,664
         using an awl,          
    she scores a line in the    
            fabric.             

44
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,400
  the line serves as a guide    

45
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,704
  as she stitches the squares   
together to complete the slot.  

46
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:33,078
       she layers a third       
    leather-trimmed block of    
             fabric             

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,347
   to create a second slot,     

48
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,615
   then adds a leather panel    

49
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,718
      that forms the third      
       credit-card slot.        

50
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,156
      she glues and tucks       
      the excess leather        

51
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,825
         over the back          
     of the fabric pocket.      

52
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,627
 then she checks the alignment  
         of the slots           

53
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,296
          with a tool           
     called a bone folder.      

54
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,564
        the next worker         

55
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,633
      sews the credit-card      
     compartment together.      

56
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,036
     there are two of these     
          per wallet.           

57
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:00,639
  they glue both compartments   
     to the wallet's spine      

58
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,309
  made of fabric and leather.   

59
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,044
      this spine is called      
       the bend section,        

60
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:10,116
        because it bends        
  to fold the wallet in two.    

61
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,451
 she attaches the bend section  

62
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,986
          to a divider          
     for the money pocket.      

63
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,521
 this divider is a bit longer   

64
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,590
       than the assembled       
     interior components,       

65
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,126
         to facilitate          
      the bending action.       

66
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:23,796
     she glues a lining to      
the wallet's leather exterior.  

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,667
    here, she uses a special    
             hammer             

68
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,004
     to ensure the interior     
    and exterior components     

69
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,039
  of this wallet adhere well.   

70
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,381
   then she trims the corner    
   of the rim to make it look   
             neat.              

71
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,087
     she rounds the corners     
         of the wallet          

72
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,422
     to give them a gentler     
            profile.            

73
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,429
        now she stitches        
    the assembly together,      

74
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,499
  leaving the bill pocket open  
          at the top.           

75
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,304
     the next worker tucks      
  a metal wedge under the rim   

76
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,039
           to protect           
    the rest of the wallet      

77
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,377
      as she trims the rim      
     close to the stitch.       

78
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,147
   removing these few slivers   
              will              
make the wallet more flexible.  

79
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,519
   she slides the bone folder   
  into each credit-card slot    

80
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,521
    to remove excess glue.      

81
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,325
      finally, a few dabs       
   of leather preservative,     

82
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,128
     and this luxury wallet     
      is ready for retail       

83
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,797
  with a price tag to match.    

84
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:38,737
     the only question is,      
 will that be cash or credit?   

85
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,422
   narrator: the french horn    
    has a four-octave range     

86
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,390
 and distinctive mellow sound.  

87
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,159
       as with other brass      
          instruments,          

88
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,494
       the musician plays       
  certain valve combinations    

89
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,497
     and alters lip tension     
  to produce the right notes.   

90
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,366
  however, on a french horn,    

91
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,635
         the mouthpiece         
     is relatively small,       

92
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:13,205
   making this instrument one   
   of the most challenging to   
             play.              

93
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,510
   the french horn is made up   
 of 13 feet of coiled tubing,   

94
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,046
        a set of valves,        
      and a flared bell.        

95
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,852
     to make the tail end,      

96
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,854
  they shape a sheet of brass   
    around a steel mandrel,     

97
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,858
 then braze the edges together  
        to form a tube.         

98
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,866
    with a burnishing tool,     
    an artisan rounds out the   
             shape.             

99
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,735
      next, they lubricate      
         a brass disk           

100
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,272
    as it spins on a lathe.     

101
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,176
   using a variety of tools,    
  they shape it into a bell.    

102
00:06:55,549 --> 00:07:00,686
 this plasma-weld machine fuses 
  the bell and tail together.   

103
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,329
  back on the lathe, they trim  
  the diameter of the bell...   

104
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,102
     ...then roll the edge      
   into a rim called a bead.    

105
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,039
   this reinforces the bell.    

106
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,044
   next, they fill the bell     

107
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,913
  with a hot, tar-like liquid   
         called pitch.          

108
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,988
     once the pitch cools,      

109
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,257
       they put the tail        
     into a forming block       

110
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,525
    and carefully bend it.      

111
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:44,129
       the hardened pitch       
       provides support,        

112
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,066
      preventing the tail       
       from collapsing.         

113
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:56,074
      they verify the bend      
      against a template.       

114
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,810
   using the same technique,    

115
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:01,012
     they shape the pieces      
 that form the horn's tubing.   

116
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,948
 of all the brass instruments,  

117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,285
      the french horn has       
    the most complex bends.     

118
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,887
      these valve knuckles      
       connect the tubes        

119
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,223
          to the cases          
  that will house the valves.   

120
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,492
       some french horns        
      have three valves.        

121
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,429
    this double french horn     
           has four.            

122
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,966
      each valve case goes      
  onto this alignment device,   

123
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:25,237
  which pushes in the knuckles  
     to the correct depth.      

124
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,973
   after brazing the knuckles   
         to the cases,          

125
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,843
    they hollow out the case    
   interiors with a cutter.     

126
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,181
   then they solder the valve   
              cases             
         to each other          

127
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,350
    with connecting rings.      

128
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:44,589
  they insert the tubing parts  
   into the valve knuckles.     

129
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,193
       these curved tubes       
    are the horn's slides.      

130
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,861
          the musician          
     tunes the instrument       

131
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,065
  by adjusting them in and out  
    of the straight tubes.      

132
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,477
  after soldering the straight  
    tubes to the knuckles,      

133
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:11,016
 they remove the slides for now 
       to make other areas      
          accessible.           

134
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,218
      then they solder this     
            partially           
    assembled valve section     

135
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,121
     to the tail and bell.      

136
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,759
     now they apply buffing     
            compound            

137
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,097
     and polish the horn's      
      interior surfaces.        

138
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,370
          they polish           
 the more accessible surfaces   

139
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,108
  with a cloth buffing wheel.   

140
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,777
     then they wash off the     
            compound            

141
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,915
  and coat the entire surface   
   in a protective lacquer.     

142
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:47,119
       now final assembly       
    of the valve section can    
             begin.             

143
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,855
      they install rotors       
      in the valve cases        

144
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,623
 and levers to activate them.   

145
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,795
    unlike piston valves on     
   a trumpet that move up and   
             down,              

146
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,365
      these valves rotate       
      to direct air flow        

147
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,801
        through specific        
     tubing combinations.       

148
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:09,274
 a lever connects to each valve 
   via a rod and nylon cord.    

149
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,618
     with the valve section     
         now complete,          

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,887
  they reinstall the slides,    

151
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,224
   then do a final wipe-down    
   to remove grease residue     

152
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,526
       and fingerprints.        

153
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:36,235
      this pristine finish      
           complements          
   the superb sound quality.

     [ french horn plays ]      

155
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,257
    narrator: soy sauce is a    
             staple             
       of asian cuisine,        

156
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,327
    used as both a condiment    
    and cooking ingredient.     

157
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,063
      its roots are in the      
           seasonings           
       of ancient china.        

158
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,800
 today, you can buy artificial  
     or chemically enhanced     
           versions,            

159
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,269
    but authentic soy sauce     
        is all-natural          

160
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:16,675
 and made the traditional way,  
by brewing soybeans and wheat.  

161
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,477
     at this small soy-sauce    
            company,            

162
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,080
   they use the centuries-old   
   slow-fermentation method     

163
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,884
  and just five ingredients --  
          soybeans...           

164
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,619
           water...             

165
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,821
           wheat...             

166
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,957
          sea salt...           

167
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,826
          and yeast.            

168
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,163
 they begin by pouring soybeans 
     into a cooking device      

169
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,499
    called a steam kettle.      

170
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,638
    after thoroughly rinsing    
      the soybeans twice,       

171
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,707
      they fill the kettle      
         with water...          

172
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,244
     ...then close the lid      

173
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,580
       and boil the beans       
        for four hours.         

174
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,450
    meanwhile, they pan-roast   
              wheat             
         in a skillet           

175
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,719
     for about 25 minutes.      

176
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,789
    then they put the roasted   
              wheat             
        through a mill.         

177
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:08,193
 the mill's steel rollers crack 
     each grain into several    
            pieces.             

178
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,933
   this will enable the yeast   
 to better penetrate the wheat  

179
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,269
     during the fermentation    
            process.            

180
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,474
  when the soybeans are ready,  
    they take them out of the   
             kettle             

181
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,611
      and spread them out       
    in large trays to cool.     

182
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:33,418
      when the beans cool       
   to 91 degrees fahrenheit,    

183
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
  it's time to add the wheat.   

184
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,756
    after mixing everything     
          thoroughly,           

185
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,492
     they sprinkle on yeast     
        and mix again.          

186
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,760
   the ingredient proportions   
            are key             

187
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,130
     and therefore a company    
            secret.             

188
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,033
    to activate the yeast,      

189
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,235
     they transfer the mix      
       to shallow boxes         

190
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,370
         and stack them         
      for about 48 hours        

191
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,773
   in a controlled incubation   
             room.              

192
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,842
  this process generates heat,  
         which rises,           

193
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,779
   so they have to gradually    
   move boxes to lower racks    

194
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,116
    to prevent overheating,     
  which would kill the yeast.   

195
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:07,719
      for the next stage,       
       they make a brine        

196
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,722
    by mixing fine sea salt     
      with spring water.        

197
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,729
     to give its soy sauce      
     a distinctive taste,       

198
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:21,666
     this company repurposes    
             bourbon            
       barrels from local       
          distilleries          

199
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,403
     to use as fermentation     
            vessels.            

200
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,873
 traces of bourbon in the wood  
     permeate the mix as it     
           ferments,            

201
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,710
     imbuing the sauce with     
    a subtle smoky and sweet    
            flavor.             

202
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,814
 after dissolving the sea salt  
     in the spring water,       

203
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,684
   they add the soybean mix,    
      creating a moromi,        

204
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,420
       the japanese word        
       for soybean mash.        

205
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,356
 they blend for a few minutes   

206
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,825
      then seal the barrel      
   and leave it to ferment.     

207
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,029
    for the first six weeks,    
          once daily,           

208
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,498
      they open the barrel      
      and mix the moromi        

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,700
      to aerate the gases       
        that build up.          

210
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,103
  this keeps the yeast active   
 and helps develop the flavor.  

211
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:04,109
  then, after that, they open   
   and mix just once a week.    

212
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,778
      after 12 long months      
       of fermentation,         

213
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,846
      it's finally ready.       

214
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,583
      they open the barrel      
    and mix one last time.      

215
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,723
   then they empty the barrel   
    onto a sheet of muslin      

216
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,560
         lining the tub         
  of a stainless-steel press.   

217
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,265
    they fold over the sheet    
   to enclose the moromi...     

218
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:38,377
   ...then lay down planks of   
              wood              
   to form a solid surface.     

219
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,954
       the press applies        
     six tons of pressure,      

220
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,489
  forcing the planks downward   
      against the moromi.       

221
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,225
       this squeezes out        
        all the liquid,         

222
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,894
    which is the soy sauce.     

223
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,030
    it exits through a hose     
    at the base of the tub      

224
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:04,169
  and moves on to be filtered   
     and heat-pasteurized.      

225
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,504
       the pressed moromi       
        gets a new life         

226
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,441
 as high-protein animal feed.   

227
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,109
     while many soy sauces      
      are mass-produced,        

228
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,579
       this factory brews       
   small batches at a time.     

229
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,382
         a batch yields         
      about 600 bottles,        

230
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,852
         each of which          
  workers here fill manually.   

231
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,922
      they top each bottle      
   with a plastic diffuser,     

232
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:27,859
        which dispenses         
    just a dash of sauce at a   
             time.              

233
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,861
  then they twist on a plastic  
              cap               

234
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,730
     and slip a shrinkable      
     plastic band over it.      

235
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,000
       using a heat gun,        
      they seal the band        

236
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,535
     tightly around the cap     
          and bottle.           

237
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,137
        then the label,         

238
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,874
 on which they write the batch  
    code and bottle number by   
             hand,              

239
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:46,611
        a fitting finale        
 for this signature soy sauce.  

240
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,826
           narrator:            
    children's ride-on cars     

241
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,362
    are, quite simply, fun to   
             drive.             

242
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,966
   these molded plastic cars    
      come in hot colors        

243
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,502
 and often have a friendly face 
         on the front.          

244
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,437
  these cars have character,    

245
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,839
         and that's why         
  it's often bumper-to-bumper   

246
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,842
       at the neighborhood      
          playground.           

247
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,715
      there's nothing like      
     that new-car feeling,      

248
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,651
      especially when it's      
   your first set of wheels.    

249
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,055
        like many toys,         
 the appeal of the ride-on car  

250
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,458
  lies with children's desire   
      to emulate adults.        

251
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,127
      and behind the wheel      
 of their own little vehicles,  

252
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,530
a child can feel all grown up.  

253
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:42,400
   today's child-size coupes    
   are synthetic creations.     

254
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,269
           they start           
  with plastic resin pellets.   

255
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:49,073
 they mix in chemical additives 
     and recycled plastic       

256
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,744
     and grind it all into a    
            powder.             

257
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,146
       the powder funnels       
    into a shaking sifter,      

258
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:58,416
 which screens out large pieces 
      the grinder missed.       

259
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,019
         it then flows          
      into a big blender.       

260
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,955
       the plastic powder       
looks a lot like pastry flour,  

261
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:07,158
       but not for long.        

262
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,561
      the next ingredient       
       is the colorant.         

263
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:13,498
  there are various vivid hues  
        to choose from.         

264
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,102
 they pour a measured amount of 
red colorant into the blender,  

265
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,571
     and a spiraling beater     
    evenly distributes it,      

266
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:22,040
   turning the white powder to  
              red.              

267
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,176
  they portion it into jugs,    

268
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,646
       which then shuttle       
       down a conveyor.         

269
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,049
   they arrive at a carousel    
    of molds of car shapes.     

270
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,718
   a worker empties the jugs    
  of colored plastic granules   

271
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,653
          into them.            

272
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,654
these little grains of plastic  

273
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,591
  are about to be transformed   
        into car parts.         

274
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,727
      they lower the lid,       

275
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,430
 which contains the top halves  
         of the molds.          

276
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,002
    the mold cage then spins    
as it travels through an oven.  

277
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,337
   the plastic inside melts,    

278
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,206
     and the spinning action    
            ensures             

279
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,341
      it completely coats       
    the inside of the molds     

280
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,345
     to create solid parts      
    with a hollow interior.     

281
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,415
      the cage then rolls       
        into a station,         

282
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,817
     where a spray of water     
     cools everything down      

283
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,554
 and causes the plastic inside  
         to solidify.           

284
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,424
 the mold cage stops spinning,  

285
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,960
    and a worker hooks it up    
          to a crane,           

286
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,063
     which lifts the lid.       

287
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,634
 the powdered colored plastic   

288
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,303
      has been transformed      
    into ride-on-car parts,     

289
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,473
     and it's taken just 35     
            minutes.            

290
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,846
    some parts fall out, and    
             others             
    have to be pulled out.      

291
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,283
 but it's easy work, thanks to  
 the mold's nonstick surface.   

292
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,119
    seepage during molding      

293
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,055
 creates unwanted bits and nubs 
     on the main car body       

294
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,258
  that they trim off by hand.   

295
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,129
     they also shave areas      
      that appear uneven.       

296
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,464
       vents were formed        
    in the molding process      

297
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,333
         to release air         
   in the core of the part.     

298
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,735
    they now cap the vents      

299
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,772
     to keep little fingers     
  from getting stuck inside.    

300
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:08,747
     they trim the car roof     
   to improve its contours.     

301
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,815
       this also gets rid       
      of any rough edges,       

302
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,584
   making it child-friendly.    

303
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:23,761
  they fit company medallions   
     into slots in the roof     
            pillars.            

304
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,363
     and they do a bit more     
            trimming            

305
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,199
     to improve the profile     
         of the parts.          

306
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:33,037
   drills now work in concert   
    to bore assembly holes      

307
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,373
       into the main part       
        of this coupe.          

308
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,578
  an employee then blasts out   
     the plastic shavings       

309
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,414
      with an air nozzle.       

310
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:48,919
   he applies a sticker with    
    production information on   
             it...              

311
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,823
         and then does          
      a final inspection.       

312
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,326
       if he's satisfied        
       with the quality,        

313
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,962
   he applies another company   
             logo.              

314
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,201
        now flames lick         
  the plastic roofs and doors   

315
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,336
  as they briefly torch them.   

316
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,072
     they melt the surface      
          just enough           

317
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,674
  to give it a shiny veneer.    

318
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,814
           at the end           
    of the production line,     

319
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:21,619
   they pack up all the parts   
   of this children's ride-on   
              car,              

320
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,555
   from the roof pillars...     

321
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,024
        to the tires...         

322
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,626
    to the steering wheel.      

323
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:33,230
     everything fits neatly     
       into one package.        

324
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,233
  then it will be up to mom or  
              dad               

325
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:39,571
   to assemble all the pieces   
     of this ride-on car.       

326
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,241
  it's a job that should take   
    about 15 minutes or so.     

327
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:49,447
       then zoom away --        
 no driver's license required.  

328
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:03,194
    if you have any comments
