00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,024
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,993
golf balls.          

5
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,299
furniture handles.       

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,471
parking meters.        

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,910
and room dividers.       

8
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,255
different types of golf balls deliver different results.   

9
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,524
highly skilled golfers often use
what's called a wound ball -- 

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,994
a ball made of rubber thread wound tightly over a core --  

11
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,464
because its flight is more controllable.     

12
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:08,667
but most people use what's called a two-piece ball --   

13
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,837
a ball whose core is covered in a dimpled material.     

14
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,476
today's golf ball has really come a long way   

15
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:21,079
if you consider that the early ones were made of feathers.  

16
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,550
this is what's inside now -- a bouncy rubber.        

17
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,952
they mix it up with other chemicals to make a hot batter 

18
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,355
and then roll it out like a pie crust,       

19
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:33,892
cooling it between two huge steel drums. 

20
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,297
next they push the rolled-up rubbery sheets  

21
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,099
into this machine, called an extruder.      

22
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:45,437
there's a ram inside, and it  
forces the rubber through a die.

23
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,907
this makes shapes that resemble
large marshmallows,      

24
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,375
called slugs.         

25
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:55,380
a conveyor belt sends them to a compression-mold machine. 

26
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,784
here a worker positions the slugs in a steel mold.   

27
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,786
the slugs often vary in color 

28
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,590
depending on the type of ball being produced.        

29
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,592
when the door closes,     

30
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,661
the bottom part of the mold presses up into the top part, 

31
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,998
applying over a ton of pressure.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,133
this is a shape-and-bake system

33
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,135
because inside this mold,   

34
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,071
the newly rounded rubber is cooking           

35
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,407
at 332 degrees fahrenheit.   

36
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,843
baking it for 13 minutes hardens it.          

37
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,949
then after it's cooled with water,          

38
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:35,353
a worker places a piece of   
slotted plexiglas over the mold.

39
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,755
this holds down the leftover trimmings     

40
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,126
so that only the ball shapes get picked up by the vacuum.  

41
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,967
he peels off the excess rubber for recycling later.      

42
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,237
the marshmallow-shaped slugs have now been transformed   

43
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,307
into a solid golf-ball core.  

44
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:59,511
a robot transports these cores to another mold.        

45
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,381
a ram pushes melted plastic through tubes         

46
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,649
and into a mold cavity.    

47
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,384
this forms the outside shell of the golf ball,       

48
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,852
complete with the dimples   

49
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,589
that will help the ball travel farther.        

50
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,528
this is an inside look at a ball
with its new shell.      

51
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,537
this injecting-molding system generates four dozen golf balls

52
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,172
every minute.         

53
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,610
the new balls are on the move. 

54
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,878
they roll into a bin      

55
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,948
which funnels them to a golf-ball elevator.    

56
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,684
they're on their way to get cleaned up.       

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,219
look closely, and you'll see  

58
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,155
little pieces of leftover plastic on the ball shells.  

59
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,558
the next process will get rid of that.     

60
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:54,299
this is an automatic miller  
that removes the excess plastic.

61
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,111
this is a golf ball before milling.        

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,046
and here it is after.     

63
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,582
the flecks of plastic have been removed.       

64
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,986
next robotic arms shovel the golf balls     

65
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,521
towards a chute entry.     

66
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,590
this is a quality checkpoint. 

67
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,658
if the ball is not smooth and uniform,          

68
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,328
it won't go through this hole. 

69
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:27,599
now a wheel rolls the golf balls
towards a stamping machine.  

70
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,870
robotic arms carry silicone pads
to an etched steel plate.   

71
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,639
the pads soak up ink from the etched plate     

72
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,341
and transfer it to the balls. 

73
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,749
the pads brand each ball with a player number,     

74
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,552
the company name, and the model type.      

75
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,023
then beams of ultraviolet light
harden the ink.        

76
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,634
they dump the balls into a bin,

77
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:07,038
but they funnel some balls over
to another stamping machine.  

78
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,240
this one does custom logoing. 

79
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,276
now, that's a stamp of approval.

80
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,848
next an automated machine sprays
the balls with polyurethane  

81
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,917
while they rotate atop spindles.

82
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,853
the polyurethane protects the ink logos     

83
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,690
that have been stamped on the balls.         

84
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,266
robotic arms carry the wet golf balls to a drying rack,  

85
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:38,937
where they cook at 150 degrees fahrenheit for 5 minutes.   

86
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,873
then they're done.       

87
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,009
and that's the technique behind the golf ball.     

88
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,480
it's up to you to explain your golf technique.      

89
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,625
narrator: imagine a dresser with antique-style brass pulls.

90
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:04,429
now imagine that same dresser with country-style wooden knobs

91
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,032
or funky plastic knobs or sleek
handles in stainless steel.  

92
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,401
the decorative hardware    

93
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,436
on a piece of furniture or on cabinetry        

94
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,305
dramatically affects its look, 

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,742
so changing them is an easy and inexpensive makeover.   

96
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,380
how would we get a grip on things           

97
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,848
without knobs and handles?   

98
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,851
they're more than something that can open doors for you.  

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,989
the many styles add to the appeal of our furniture.

100
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,059
to make a handle, an electrical
hoist drops big chunks of zinc 

101
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,062
into a melting furnace.    

102
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,465
at 800 degrees fahrenheit,   
metal quickly turns into liquid.

103
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:44,136
it's so hot, you'd lose a finger
if you touched it.       

104
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,339
automated arms move an iron pot
full of the liquid       

105
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,606
to a railroad car,       

106
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,476
which takes it to the next stage.       

107
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,545
here they pour the liquid metal

108
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,814
into another furnace that's just as hot.      

109
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,682
this is called a machine furnace.       

110
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,953
a hydraulically driven cylinder
pushes the liquid metal    

111
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,955
through a system of nozzles and pipes           

112
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,423
that run through the furnace. 

113
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,893
it carries the liquid metal to a die.           

114
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,129
the die shapes the handles cookie-cutter style.      

115
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,634
water flushes through the die. 

116
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,035
this cools down the zinc,   

117
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,037
and it hardens into a handle shape      

118
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,439
with a lot of extra molding  

119
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,742
that they're going to have to get rid of.         

120
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,045
so, now that they've cooled,  

121
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,716
it's safe to touch them and remove some of that waste. 

122
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,718
a worker snaps some of it off 

123
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,920
and tosses it into a bin for recycling later,      

124
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,656
and the handle shapes go into a separate bin.    

125
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,193
but there are still some little
bits of waste on the handles  

126
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,461
called overflows,       

127
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,098
so a mechanically driven spinner
tosses the handles around   

128
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,201
and knocks off any overflows that have been missed.     

129
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,972
it's a lot faster than picking 
off those little pieces by hand.

130
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,547
a worker dumps the handle shapes
into a bin.          

131
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,383
they're definitely starting to take shape now.       

132
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,824
a similar die-casting system is used to make knobs,     

133
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,093
but the knobs come in two interlocking pieces.  

134
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,731
they place them on a turntable and fit them together.     

135
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,771
then a 4-ton hydraulic press presses down on the knob,   

136
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,507
and that pressure seals them. 

137
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,708
they pour a mixture of water and oil on the knobs 

138
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,443
to cool and lubricate them,  

139
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,112
while an automated machine   

140
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,314
drives a screw into the back of the knob.          

141
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,850
this makes a thread pattern inside of it          

142
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,987
so it can be easily screwed onto furniture later.     

143
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,390
now they plunge the handles into a chemical bath.     

144
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,259
the chemicals help to conduct electricity.    

145
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,729
this process is called electroplating.   

146
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,664
the handles are negatively charged.    

147
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,468
the brass particles in the water
are positively charged.    

148
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,269
they attract and connect,   

149
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,439
and this causes the brass plating to form.   

150
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,475
they dip the handles into the chemical wash twice  

151
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,545
and then rinse twice.     

152
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:18,222
next they dump the brass handles
into a vat of acid.      

153
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,691
this oxidizes it,       

154
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,961
blackening the finish to make it look antique.    

155
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,097
this brass pull has aged a hundred years        

156
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,899
in just a few minutes.     

157
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,372
next they funnel the handles into a big, round polisher.  

158
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,173
it's called a bowl vibrator.  

159
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,177
the handles are mixed in with steel ball bearings.   

160
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,845
the machine vibrates,     

161
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,783
and the friction from the ball bearings polishes the handles. 

162
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,420
now those antique brass handles
have a shinier finish.     

163
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,791
sometimes they use ceramic pellets in the polisher

164
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,193
instead of ball bearings.   

165
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,862
they spray soap and water into the bowl         

166
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,332
to lubricate the handles and allow them to move freely. 

167
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,735
this gentler friction results in a different finish. 

168
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,672
the polish on the handles will be brighter.       

169
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,811
now they put a handle into a clamp.         

170
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,481
with air pressure, it squeeze the handle     

171
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,950
so that it hooks into a backplate.       

172
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,953
when the pressure is released, the fit is snug.        

173
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,757
a front and backplate gives a handle a more elaborate look.

174
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,564
they buff up a knob with a cloth polishing wheel  

175
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:33,898
that's mechanically driven.  

176
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,370
this process gives knobs and handles a certain gleam.  

177
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,372
it's the finishing touch.   

178
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,530
narrator: the beatles wrote a song about lovely rita the meter maid,  

179
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,867
but try finding anyone else singing the praises      

180
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,601
of those uniformed patrols   

181
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,871
who ticket your car when your meter expires.    

182
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,809
parking meters have been around
since the 1930s,        

183
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,979
and ever since then, drivers have had to pay for parking.  

184
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,619
it's time to find out     

185
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,690
just how these heavy-duty piggy banks are made.     

186
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,759
first the low-tech part.    

187
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:38,028
the time-limit label goes onto a zinc dome-shaped plate. 

188
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,598
then a worker sprays lubricant 

189
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,900
onto various parts of the motherboard       

190
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,170
that contains computer circuitry.      

191
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:48,439
after he snaps the board    
onto the plate, he screws it in.

192
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,509
then he fastens another    
dome-shaped plate onto the back,

193
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,246
sandwiching the motherboard between the two plates.    

194
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,248
the worker hooks the board up 

195
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,584
to the power source -- the battery pack --      

196
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,186
and he tucks the pack into a special compartment   

197
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,589
so that it's secure.      

198
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,926
then he plugs a programming device called an "x" key    

199
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,861
into prongs protruding from the motherboard.     

200
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,932
the key feeds software to the motherboard inside.   

201
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,202
when numbers appear on the screen, it's programmed.

202
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,537
the next piece, called a smartchute,      

203
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,405
also has computer circuitry.  

204
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,809
it analyzes the coins as they fall through the meter.

205
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,979
it can even recognize coins from other countries.     

206
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,886
he puts the chute into a protective plastic casing  

207
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,355
and plugs it into the protruding prongs   

208
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,490
that were used earlier to program the meter.     

209
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,292
the two boards make a connection       

210
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,294
and can now communicate to one another.        

211
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,096
he clicks another zinc plate over the coin chute      

212
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,367
and adds a stainless-steel coin slot for added protection.

213
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,502
this card is a radio-frequency probe   

214
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,038
that detects how much money is in the meter        

215
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,574
as well as maintenance information.    

216
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,044
just how good is a parking meter
at analyzing coins?      

217
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,980
this particular meter was made in canada.      

218
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,383
a canadian nickel and a british 20 pence     

219
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,785
are roughly the same size.   

220
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,788
put in a canadian nickel, and you get three minutes.   

221
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,994
but try the 20 pence. nothing registers.       

222
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,764
the meter treats it like a plug nickel.      

223
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,403
the meters are now in an environmental chamber.  

224
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,073
this chamber replicates the most
extreme climate conditions.  

225
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,877
it's a test to make sure they're
ready for life on the street. 

226
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,879
now it's time to make a lock. 

227
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,483
he puts a zinc-alloy lock plug containing brass tumblers   

228
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,218
into a miniature lathe.    

229
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,087
the lathe spins rapidly on its axis          

230
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,623
while pressing against the hard steel blades. 

231
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,892
the blades cut the spinning lock tumblers   

232
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,627
to the appropriate length.   

233
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,162
the result?          

234
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,098
a lock plug that has brass tumblers of different lengths 

235
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,635
that can't be opened without the correct key.    

236
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,705
here a worker places the lock barrel in a vise   

237
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,708
to give a better view of the lock system.      

238
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,511
as you can see, it turns easily with the key. 

239
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,513
but, vandals, beware.     

240
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,717
this lock is designed to be tough to pick.      

241
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,923
next he inserts the lock into the bottom of a coin can 

242
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,258
that's made of plastic.    

243
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,659
he closes it          

244
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,796
and then puts it on what's called a sonic welding machine.

245
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,432
it emits high-frequency sound vibrations        

246
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,001
that actually melt the rigid plastic,       

247
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,005
welding the top and bottom pieces together.  

248
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,074
now these coins will be really tough to get out    

249
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,210
without that key.       

250
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,347
next he brushes a second lock system with a lubricant    

251
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,148
and adds a hard steel shield  

252
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,618
that will resist attempts to drill into it.       

253
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,021
this lock goes onto an iron door

254
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,425
which will be part of the vault
that contains the coin can.  

255
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,495
he brushes the lock assembly with another lubricant     

256
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,898
to make the locking operation smoother.           

257
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,708
then he installs a rubber gasket
along the frame        

258
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,443
for the meter dome window.   

259
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,111
this gasket seals the dome   

260
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,613
and protects the electronics from harsh weather.      

261
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,316
he places a tough plastic window
on the gasket         

262
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,051
and tops it with a zinc strap. 

263
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,120
he screws all the pieces together.           

264
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,590
then he places the iron case  
that will hold all the mechanics

265
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,260
on top of the vault containing the coin can.    

266
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,330
he attaches the windowed cap and strap assembly with hinges.

267
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,666
and there's a third lock    

268
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,269
to help protect the electrical 
components of the parking meter.

269
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,537
after a check for fit and function,     

270
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,540
he installs the actual mechanics.     

271
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,408
this means it's all systems go.

272
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,211
the parking meter is ready for the street.        

273
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,280
later the coins can be collected

274
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,083
without even opening the plastic coin can.     

275
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,485
this special receptacle activates the lock       

276
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,886
at the bottom of the can.   

277
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,624
once turned, the coins deposited
into the parking meter     

278
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,859
drop into the receptacle.   

279
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,101
narrator: if you need to section off part of a room, 

280
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,238
there are many types of room dividers that can do the job. 

281
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,109
accordion doors routinely divide
meeting rooms.         

282
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,578
sliding walls made up of multiple panels       

283
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,581
can easily split a large reception hall in half 

284
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,684
or partition an office in no time at all.       

285
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,728
this particular company makes two types of room dividers -- 

286
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,129
sliding panels called operable walls     

287
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,065
and accordion doors.      

288
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,801
both have built-in soundproofing.    

289
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,738
the folding mechanism     
at the core of an accordion door

290
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,338
is called a pantograph.    

291
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,675
it's made of flat steel bars riveted together        

292
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,210
in a crisscross configuration. 

293
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,746
a worker tightens the rivets  

294
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,815
just enough to hold the bars in position          

295
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,751
without impeding their movement.

296
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,287
then he inserts pins along the top and bottom,   

297
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:07,691
securing them with steel retaining rings.  

298
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,560
the pantograph is custom-built 

299
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,163
to expand to the precise width of the door they're making,  

300
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,698
the pins attached to the covers

301
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,900
that will later sandwich the pantograph,    

302
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,838
forming the accordion door's surface.            

303
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,440
to make those covers, they first make slats.     

304
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,710
this automated machine hot-glues a band of cardboard 

305
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,112
onto a band of steel.     

306
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,081
then a series of rollers    

307
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,517
progressively folds the sides upward,       

308
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,720
forming a steel edge around the cardboard.     

309
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:39,590
finally the machine cuts the continuous band into slats,

310
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,859
whose length is the height of the accordion door     

311
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,261
they're making.        

312
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,397
now workers pair up the slats, 

313
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,400
connecting them with cardboard strips.     

314
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,874
they feed each pair into a glue machine.      

315
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,609
the slats come out adhered   

316
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:03,181
to a soft and flexible type of paper that's tearproof.   

317
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,692
next workers connect six pairs of slats to form a panel.   

318
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,495
then they glue on the decorative surface --   

319
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,965
in this case, commercial-quality vinyl.   

320
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,567
to block sound from passing through the space       

321
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,636
above and below the accordion door,      

322
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,905
a worker glues a felt-and-vinyl strip     

323
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,707
to the top and bottom of each panel.         

324
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,844
after lining the inside of each
panel with acoustic wool,   

325
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,246
a soundproofing material,   

326
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,781
another worker gathers the number of panels      

327
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,650
required for the door's width. 

328
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,851
he attaches them        

329
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,588
using industrial-strength steel staples.         

330
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,257
then he slips u-shaped steel channels    

331
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:49,193
onto what will be the door's inside folds.    

332
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,196
using an air-powered machine called a serter,        

333
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:55,633
he presses the channels tightly
in place.           

334
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,339
now he installs the pentographs.

335
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,341
the height of the doors determine how many.      

336
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,476
using steel retaining rings,  

337
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,047
he locks the pentograph pins into holes on the channels.  

338
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,989
the second cover goes on the same way.         

339
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,636
after this, workers apply a metal trim   

340
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,171
to finish off the front and back ends.         

341
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,042
they also install a handle for opening and closing the door. 

342
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,646
the door hangs by wheels attached to the top pentograph.

343
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,182
operable walls are made up of several sliding panels.   

344
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,452
for each one,         
workers build an aluminum frame,

345
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,922
then install a soundproofing mechanism --  

346
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,857
a crank-activated aluminum seal

347
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,893
that juts out to fill the gap above and below the panel.   

348
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,397
to make the front and back faces
of each panel,         

349
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,866
workers begin with a sheet of gypsum board.        

350
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,069
to one side of it, they glue a steel sheet    

351
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,339
that's at least 4/100 of an inch thick.    

352
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,074
this provides soundproofing.  

353
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,211
to the other side, they glue a decorative surface --    

354
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,745
in this case, laminate,    

355
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:18,482
a thinner version of the material used for countertops. 

356
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,619
a machine called a pinch roll applies pressure        

357
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,988
to ensure the laminate adheres well.   

358
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,025
workers slide the face into the frame,        

359
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,160
fill in the middle       

360
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,428
with acoustical wool for soundproofing,       

361
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,665
then slide in a second facing. 

362
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,440
they close up the bottom,   

363
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,010
then test the retractable soundproofing seal.      

364
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,716
the last step is to install the wheels    

365
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,718
that run along the ceiling rail.

366
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:59,323
an operable wall can have one or many types of faces --   

367
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,059
from fabric, mirror, or galvanized steel      

368
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,230
to blackboard, markerboard, even cork bulletin board.
