00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,304
shielded by the dark portions of
the negative.                   
when they wash away the         

398
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,406
the negative.                   
when they wash away the         
unhardened color, they're left  

399
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,708
when they wash away the         
unhardened color, they're left  
with a color image.             

400
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,843
unhardened color, they're left  
with a color image.             
they layer the films to make the

401
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,978
with a color image.             
they layer the films to make the
client a mockup of the finished 

402
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
they layer the films to make the
client a mockup of the finished 
lottery ticket, in this case a  

403
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,482
client a mockup of the finished 
lottery ticket, in this case a  
scratch-and-win type.           

404
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,083
lottery ticket, in this case a  
scratch-and-win type.           
now they make the printing      

405
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,918
scratch-and-win type.           
now they make the printing      
plates -- one for each color of 

406
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,588
now they make the printing

the design -- first for the     
non-playing area, everything

00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,193
the design -- first for the     
non-playing area, everything    
outside the scratch zone.       

409
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,794
non-playing area, everything    
outside the scratch zone.       
each negative goes onto a       

410
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,730
outside the scratch zone.       
each negative goes onto a       
paper-thin aluminum plate coated

411
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,233
each negative goes onto a       
paper-thin aluminum plate coated
with a u.v.-sensitive emulsion. 

412
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,434
paper-thin aluminum plate coated
with a u.v.-sensitive emulsion. 
they expose the plate to        

413
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,736
with a u.v.-sensitive emulsion. 
they expose the plate to        
u.v. light for about 20 seconds.

00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,939
they expose the plate to        
u.v. light for about 20 seconds.
this hardens the unshielded     

415
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:55,873
u.v. light for about 20 seconds.
this hardens the unshielded     
emulsion.                       

416
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,142
this hardens the unshielded     
emulsion.                       
the rest is washed away in a

00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,344
emulsion.                       
the rest is washed away in a    
chemical bath, leaving the

for the ticket's playing area, a

for the ticket's playing area, a
similar process is used, but    

421
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,820
for the ticket's playing area, a
similar process is used, but    
instead of an aluminum plate    

422
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,088
similar process is used, but    
instead of an aluminum plate    
coated in emulsion, they use one

423
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,756
instead of an aluminum plate    
coated in emulsion, they use one
made of photo polymer, a        

424
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,826
coated in emulsion, they use one
made of photo polymer, a        
light-sensitive plastic.        

425
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,227
made of photo polymer, a        
light-sensitive plastic.        
the finished plates are now     

426
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,628
light-sensitive plastic.        
the finished plates are now     
ready to go on to the printing  

427
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,428
the finished plates are now     
ready to go on to the printing

430
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,703
their raised service will work  
just like a rubber ink stamp.   
the non-playing area goes on    

431
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,336
just like a rubber ink stamp.   
the non-playing area goes on

the press applies up to nine

next comes the playing area.    

442
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,126
between color applications.     
next comes the playing area.    
a high-speed ink-jet printer    

443
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,994
next comes the playing area.    
a high-speed ink-jet printer    
first applies the game numbers,

chosen randomly by computer.    

445
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,334
first applies the game numbers,

infrared lamps dry the ink in a

infrared lamps dry the ink in a

the tickets whiz by at a rate of

then the printer gives each     

452
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,617
16 feet per second.             
then the printer gives each     
ticket a unique bar code.       

453
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,485
then the printer gives each     
ticket a unique bar code.       
this enables ticket vendors to  

454
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,220
ticket a unique bar code.       
this enables ticket vendors to  
scan your ticket to see if

this enables ticket vendors to

scan your ticket to see if      
you've won.                     
it also shows whether a winning

you've won.                     
it also shows whether a winning 
ticket is genuine or a forgery.

it also shows whether a winning 
ticket is genuine or a forgery. 
the next machine seals the game

the next machine seals the game 
numbers with layers of varnish  

460
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,032
the next machine seals the game 
numbers with layers of varnish  
and applies six coats of

00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,368
numbers with layers of varnish  
and applies six coats of        
scratchable ink.                

462
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,303
and applies six coats of        
scratchable ink.                
an electronic scanner checks the

scratchable ink.                
an electronic scanner checks the
positioning of the scratchable

00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,839
an electronic scanner checks the
positioning of the scratchable  
ink, making sure it hides the

the first three scratchable-ink

the first three scratchable-ink 
coats are black.                

468
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,781
the first three scratchable-ink 
coats are black.                
the next three are white.       

469
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,149
coats are black.                
the next three are white.       
all those layers are used to

the next three are white.       
all those layers are used to    
keep cheaters from holding the

here's the actual speed.

00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,517
before the lottery tickets are  

489
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,252
shipped out, several samples    

490

undergo a quality-control       

491

inspection.                     

492
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:00,590
the company checks that the     

493
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,492
tickets are properly printed.   

494
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,328
it also performs a series of

scratch tests and chemical tests

496
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,365
to make sure they're absolutely

cheatproof.
