00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,623
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,160
chains...           

5
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,501
...bagels...          

6
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,306
...and vinyl records.     

7
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,653
chains are as indispensable today     

8
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,255
as they were thousands of years ago.    

9
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,191
ancient historians refer to the use of metal chains   

10
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,862
for jewelry, shackles, and construction.       

11
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,599
today, chains are used for those very same purposes  

12
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,902
and many more.         

13
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,210
chains are used to tie things down,      

14
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,946
hold things together, and pull things along,     

15
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,416
and their many sizes reflect the varied uses.    

16
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,353
to make a chain, a turning drum
uncoils this wire rod     

17
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:32,157
and pulls it through a steel guide ring to a steel draw box.

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,661
grease inside the box lubricates the wire.      

19
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,298
on its way out of the box, the wire goes through a die,  

20
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,435
such as the one being demonstrated here.    

21
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,304
the die has a smaller diameter than the wire,         

22
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,506
and as the turning drum pulls it through,       

23
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,977
the wire narrows, hardens, and becomes stronger.     

24
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,983
now electrically driven tools move in from all sides.    

25
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,717
this is a forming machine.   

26
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,721
a tool called a jaw propels the wire forward,   

27
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,123
while another jaw pushes on the wire,      

28
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,259
bending it around a steel pin. 

29
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,927
it forms a "c" shape.     

30
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,864
another forming tool closes the "c,"        

31
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,599
completing one link in the chain,         

32
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,603
and then another jaw makes the next link.      

33
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,941
this machine is making jack chain,     

34
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,278
which is usually used to hang lights.        

35
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,413
another forming machine makes a chain         

36
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,849
that can haul a heavier load. 

37
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,289
a grip pulls the wire onto rollers that straighten it out.

38
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:46,030
steel cutters now make notches on both sides of the wire.   

39
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,966
these notches mark the place where the wire         

40
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,802
is to be sliced into link-sized pieces.    

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,443
a mechanized knife makes the final cut at the notches. 

42
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,646
next, roller arms loop a cut piece of wire      

43
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,181
around a steel finger.     

44
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,516
the roller arms make it look easy,       

45
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,920
but they're actually exerting tons of pressure        

46
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,921
in order to shape this wire.  

47
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,056
after the rollers form the link,

48
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,993
a pliers-like tool grabs it and turns it around.      

49
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,195
this positions the completed link       

50
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,032
so that it can connect with the next link as it's shaped. 

51
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,003
as each link is added,     

52
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,207
the chain drops into a pile below the machine.   

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,676
there are dozens of forming machines      

54
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,345
in most chain factories.    

55
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:36,548
each machine makes 50 to 60 links per minute.   

56
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,218
that's about 250 feet of chain per machine hour.       

57
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,755
to put that into perspective, one machine could make a chain 

58
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,491
as long as the empire state building is high        

59
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,261
in just under six hours.    

60
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:05,243
after the chain is formed,   
it will need to be strengthened.

61
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:08,280
so it's on to the welding machine.    

62
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,986
hammers to the left and right push the link in,       

63
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,588
then two copper blocks move in from the sides.        

64
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,257
they act as electrodes and zap both sides of the link 

65
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,660
with an electrical current.  

66
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,329
the current ripples through the gap in the link,  

67
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,598
while the hammers push it in. 

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,803
the link reaches a scorching 1,700 degrees fahrenheit.   

69
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,073
the wire melts and the link fuses together.  

70
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,481
now a pulley system drops the freshly welded chain    

71
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,950
into a heat-treating coil.   

72
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,952
an electrical current runs through the copper coil,    

73
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,855
heating the chain inside until it's orange-hot --    

74
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,758
1,724 degrees fahrenheit.   

75
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,895
the pulleys lower the chain into a tub of water to cool.  

76
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,496
the extreme temperature change 

77
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,433
alters the molecular structure of the steel,         

78
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,034
making it much harder.     

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,038
but the experience leaves the chain a bit brittle.    

80
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,306
so it goes into a second heat coil       

81
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,175
that's not as hot as the first one        

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,511
and then into another cool bath.

83
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,579
this takes away the brittleness

84
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,149
and gives the steel a bit of stretch.       

85
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,653
now the ultimate strength test --        

86
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,588
this is the chain calibrator. 

87
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,524
pulleys run the chain into a groove         

88
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,760
that's been cut into a block of steel.       

89
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,929
a clamp on the left holds it in place,       

90
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,066
while the hydraulically powered
block of steel         

91
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,567
pulls the chain to the right. 

92
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,537
will it break or will it hold? 

93
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,140
and can it handle the load?  

94
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:46,645
after all, the chain is only as strong as the weakest link. 

95
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,193
narrator: the first bagels were created in eastern europe 

96
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,761
during the 1600s.       

97
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,563
exactly why is debatable, but one account        

98
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,232
is that they were a tribute to the king of poland.     

99
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,969
the king was a military hero and a great horseman,     

100
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,572
so a baker shaped the dough to resemble a stirrup.     

101
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,875
the austrian word for "stirrup"
sounds like "bagel."      

102
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,649
you used to get bagels in just two varieties --    

103
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,451
sesame seed or poppy seed.   

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,653
today they come in a rainbow of flavors,          

105
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,123
from nine-grain to blueberry to cinnamon-raisin       

106
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,259
to whole-wheat sesame.     

107
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,862
commercial bakeries make them like this.      

108
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,432
the first step is to blend all 
the ingredients in a huge mixer.

109
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,868
these include molasses, salt, yeast, flour,      

110
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,873
sugar, malt flour, ascorbic acid, and enzymes.  

111
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,742
if needed, workers also add the special flavorings.    

112
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,879
raisins or blueberries go in when the mixing's nearly done 

113
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,414
to avoid pulverizing them.   

114
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,150
one batch of dough weighs 750 pounds       

115
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,021
and makes about 3,200 bagels. 

116
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,291
they slowly add about 26 gallons of water   

117
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,626
as the ingredients blend for 10 minutes.        

118
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,162
they monitor the water and air temperatures      

119
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,098
so that the dough reaches 78 degrees fahrenheit.     

120
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,967
that's when yeast activates,  

121
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,771
enabling the dough to rise later on.       

122
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,774
worker uses a thermometer   
to take the dough's temperature.

123
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,043
too warm,           
the dough will rise too quickly.

124
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,447
too cold and the dough won't rise enough.       

125
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:33,051
here, workers cut large chunks of dough for raisin bagels   

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,719
into smaller blocks.      

127
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,055
they'll put these blocks    
into a machine called a divider.

128
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,593
the machine squeezes the dough through small openings     

129
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,329
to create doughballs that weigh 3.7 ounces,     

130
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,664
which will each become one bagel.           

131
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,200
the divider also distributes the balls           

132
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,603
into four single files as they emerge from the machine

133
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,139
and move along plastic conveyor belts.        

134
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:59,143
they're plastic so workers   
can clean them easily and often.

135
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,812
next, a machine called a bagel former         

136
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,882
flattens the balls into strips.

137
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,285
this way, the strips can be curved into rings.       

138
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,355
the curved conveyor belt guides the dough        

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,390
through a tight circular opening

140
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,026
with a stainless-steel rod at its center.         

141
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,896
the rod forces the two ends of the strip to join in a circle. 

142
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,900
this process happens in less than two seconds,   

143
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,035
before the dough has a chance to dry out.          

144
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,436
it's the moisture in the dough 

145
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:29,641
that enables the ends     
of the strips to stick together.

146
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,710
the bagel rings emerge from the bagel former     

147
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:33,979
onto another conveyor.     

148
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,248
workers then visually inspect the rings           

149
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:40,452
to ensure they came out right. 

150
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,921
after placing the bagels onto ungreased trays,     

151
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,723
workers put them in a large room
called a proofer        

152
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,792
for 90 minutes to rise.    

153
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,928
the proofer is kept at 109 degrees fahrenheit   

154
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,164
with 80% humidity.       

155
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,870
next a worker places the trays onto a metal conveyor belt.  

156
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,739
this conveyor moves the bagels into a huge steam oven     

157
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,008
about the size of a school bus.

158
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,143
steam makes the bagels chewy and shiny.        

159
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,212
to ensure the dough develops properly,       

160
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,548
they maintain air temperature in the bakery         

161
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,018
at a constant 68 degrees fahrenheit.     

162
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,953
and there's no air-conditioning

163
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,722
to ensure the right humidity level.        

164
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,828
after baking for exactly 13 minutes           

165
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,631
at precisely 450 degrees fahrenheit,    

166
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,834
the bagels come out of the steam oven.       

167
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,637
they lost moisture during the baking process,   

168
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,174
so they now weigh around a half-ounce less than before. 

169
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,045
to cool down, the bagels move along a winding conveyor belt 

170
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,949
that snakes through 6 floors of this 1.5-square-mile bakery.

171
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,853
bagel-making ranges      
from large commercial operations

172
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,121
like this one         

173
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,523
to small neighborhood bakeries 

174
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,924
that still make them the old-fashioned way --    

175
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,860
rolling and shaping the dough by hand            

176
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,129
and baking them in a brick oven.

177
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,631
during the 50-minute journey, 

178
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:04,002
their temperatures drop to about 98 degrees fahrenheit,

179
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,806
cool enough to package in plastic bags later on.   

180
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:12,076
here, a worker inspects the bagels for shape, color,  

181
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,412
height, and shine.       

182
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,347
to help the consumer,     

183
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,617
a machine preslices the bagels almost in half.        

184
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,086
it leaves a portion uncut   

185
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:25,957
so the bagel sections stick together and stay fresh. 

186
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,960
next, workers separate the bagels into groups of six, 

187
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,029
placing them along another conveyor        

188
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,364
lined with tiny brushes.    

189
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,300
these brushes keep the bagels upright    

190
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:40,171
as they head off for packaging.

191
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,840
a mechanical arm scoops the bagels along,       

192
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,510
and another blows open the bags
and inserts the bagels.    

193
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,447
this bakery prepares up to 3,000 half-dozen packages  

194
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,781
an hour for shipping,     

195
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,051
fast enough to have a fresh bagel         

196
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,055
land on your breakfast plate as soon as 12 hours later.   

197
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,065
narrator: vinyl records have an ever-increasing following  

198
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,334
among audiophiles, collectors, and deejays.          

199
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:14,406
some say they sound better than digital cds and mp3s.   

200
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,740
to cater to this market,    

201
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,010
some record companies are releasing more music on vinyl, 

202
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:23,214
a manufacturing process that's interesting and fun to watch. 

203
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:30,422
the first step is to cut a master record.        

204
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,490
this flat disk is made of aluminum,      

205
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,894
and it will be the core of the master.         

206
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,362
the surface has a gritty texture
early on,           

207
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,232
but they sand it down and polish it smooth.     

208
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,439
they place the aluminum disks on a conveyor belt,      

209
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,642
and they ride towards a device that will coat them  

210
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,711
with a veneer of lacquer.   

211
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,916
the disk enters the curtain coater.      

212
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,651
nitrocellulose lacquer --   

213
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,321
a similar substance to nail polish --       

214
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,323
oozes out of a long, thin opening,         

215
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,993
forming a veil, or curtain.  

216
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,195
as the disk passes through the curtain,      

217
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,531
it's slathered with the lacquer.

218
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,803
rollers with scrapers catch the runoff.       

219
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:22,607
the excess lacquer they collect
is reused.           

220
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,744
the lacquer starts to dry immediately.          

221
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,680
the solvents evaporate,    

222
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,050
and the veneer hardens into a nail-polish-like finish.

223
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:39,691
but like any manicure job, there are often flaws.     

224
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,359
at this inspection station,  

225
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,628
workers scrutinize each lacquered disk      

226
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,631
for pits, bumps, or dirt.   

227
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,434
even a minor imperfection won't be tolerated,      

228
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,038
so the rejection rate is high --
about 50%.           

229
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,674
they recycle the rejects.   

230
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,846
they rim the good masters with plastic edging.      

231
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,516
it will stop the disks from  
rubbing together during stacking

232
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,218
and damaging the finish.    

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,058
next, a worker holds the disk under a hydraulic puncher   

234
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,528
that cuts a hole in the center.

235
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,465
then, handling it carefully so he doesn't disturb the finish, 

236
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,101
he places it on a spindle.   

237
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,406
a robotic arm slides      
a plastic ring down the spindle,

238
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,542
depositing it around the center hole of the disk.  

239
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,010
like the plastic edging,    

240
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:37,014
the ring will also space the disks apart.        

241
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,486
now the master disks are ready to take a trip to the studio. 

242
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,959
the lacquer disk is about to be cut.      

243
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,896
the engineer places it on the recording machine     

244
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,632
called a lathe.        

245
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:59,303
he peels the protective ribbing
away from the rim.       

246
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:03,107
he places a vacuum line at the center,         

247
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,976
which suctions to the underside of the disk  

248
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,511
and holds it in place.     

249
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,781
the engineer now moves the cutter and a microscope  

250
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,118
above the disk.        

251
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,921
he lowers the cutter onto the outer edge of the disk

252
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,190
and it does a test cut.    

253
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,262
he positions a microscope just above the test groove   

254
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:28,799
and then peers into it to get a good look at the cut. 

255
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:34,005
he makes adjustments to the cut,
and then he's ready to record. 

256
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:37,141
the lathe cuts the lead-in groove and the music begins.  

257
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,477
the sapphire-tipped cutter   

258
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,080
etches the sound into the surface of the disk. 

259
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,881
from start to finish,     

260
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,619
the recording will be one   
continuous groove in the record.

261
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,698
a computer monitors the cutting

262
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,501
and adjusts the spacing between
the grooves where needed.   

263
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:09,907
a little vacuum draws up scrap,
as the cutter carves the groove.

264
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,310
some believe this sound is warmer           

265
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,578
and has more depth than digital recordings.    

266
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:18,249
but making music fit on an analog disk       

267
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,685
is sometimes challenging.   

268
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,389
to reproduce bass, the cutter has to make big, wide grooves 

269
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,658
that take up a lot of space.  

270
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,193
and although the grooves can touch,           

271
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,196
they can't cut across one another.          

272
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,365
at the end of the recording,  

273
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:38,703
the cutter lifts and the master
disk is ready for inspection. 

274
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,740
if it's acceptable,      

275
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,410
the engineer places a sliding platform on it    

276
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,947
and scribes a unique serial number into the lacquer.

277
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:56,220
soon, this master disk will be used to make more records.   

278
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:13,037
narrator: the master disk has just been cut,       

279
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,173
but the lacquer surface is far too delicate to play.  

280
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,309
it's been produced solely to act as a mold.       

281
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,445
it will literally be pressed into service          

282
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,180
to make tougher versions of the recorded grooves.    

283
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,450
and this will enable the manufacturers       

284
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,219
to make many copies from just one.         

285
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,258
in the next step,       

286
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,329
they wash the lacquer disk with soap and water.      

287
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,665
they spray it with tin chloride
and liquid silver.       

288
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,668
the tin chloride is a sensitizer

289
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,537
that helps the silver stick to the lacquer.        

290
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,609
they wash away little bits of silver that don't stick.  

291
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,611
in seconds, one side of the lacquer    

292
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,115
has become a stunning silver disk with the grooves intact. 

293
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,021
but next, they'll add a duller metal to the silvered side   

294
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,890
in order to really stiffen the disk.  

295
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,294
they fasten it to a spindle on the underside of a tank lid.

296
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:16,434
the disk spins,        
and they rinse it one more time.

297
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,837
the water in the tank below is green            

298
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,641
because these nickel nuggets are dissolving into it.    

299
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,175
they lower the lid       

300
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,512
and the spinning disk is immersed in the solution.  

301
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,283
an electric charge fuses the nickel to the silver...  

302
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,755
...and the nickel settles neatly into the grooves.    

303
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,528
now they remove it from the tank         

304
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,197
and pry the metal layer away  

305
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,532
from the original lacquer disk.         

306
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,201
this metal layer is a stamper 

307
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,603
that will be used to press vinyl records.         

308
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,472
and the lacquer disk, which has served as its mold, 

309
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,475
is discarded.         

310
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,946
now they look for the exact center of the stamper.     

311
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,683
a worker places it under the microscope,     

312
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,219
which is part of an optical centering punch. 

313
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,488
as the stamper disk spins,   

314
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,424
he aligns the grooves with a guide in the viewfinder.

315
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:18,096
when he finds the center, he punches a hole there.    

316
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:31,042
next, they clamp the stamper disk into a trimming machine. 

317
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,647
the disk turns and a cutting wheel trims the edge,     

318
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:42,186
cutting the stamper disk to a diameter of 12 1/2 inches.

319
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,390
now the stampers are ready to make their mark.      

320
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:51,128
but first the labels must be prepared.       

321
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:55,266
a punch bores into the center of
a stack of them, making holes. 

322
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,874
then they place the labels on a mini-press.        

323
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:07,778
it rises to another cutter, which rounds them out.     

324
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,556
they pour black polyvinyl chloride pellets into a hopper.

325
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,359
the pellets fall into an extruder,       

326
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,695
which turns them into hot   
rubbery paddies called biscuits.

327
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,963
hoists above and below     

328
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,032
push labels to each side of the biscuit.        

329
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,300
suction cups hold them there  

330
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,969
while a carriage moves the biscuit forward      

331
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,771
then drops the biscuit and labels in the press.    

332
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,774
two stampers mounted in the press      

333
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,109
apply 100 tons of pressure.  

334
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,913
the stampers are a searing 380 degrees fahrenheit.    

335
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,315
they melt and mold the biscuit into a record.         

336
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,852
a quick cooling cycle hardens it

337
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,789
and bonds the labels to the vinyl.         

338
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,926
a carriage then transports it to a trimming table.      

339
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,728
the table spins the record against a knife        

340
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,398
as it cuts away the ragged edges.       

341
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,269
then, the table takes the trimmed record       

342
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,672
to the finished stack.     

343
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,540
and the process begins again. 

344
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,683
this is really         

345
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,886
a well-choreographed musical production.      

346
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,489
as one record is lifted out of the press,         

347
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,725
the next one goes in.     

348
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,901
the pressing and trimming of a vinyl record       

349
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,704
takes just 28 seconds.     

350
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,375
but it's sure to get hours of play by enthusiasts     

351
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,645
who refuse to buy into the digital revolution     

352
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,249
and still believe that vinyl is a cut above.        

353
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,739
