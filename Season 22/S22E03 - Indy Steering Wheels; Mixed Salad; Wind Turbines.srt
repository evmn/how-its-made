00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,656
            narrator:           
    the indy steering wheel     
    isn't just for steering.    

4
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:58,991
     it's the control center    
        for the racecar,        

5
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,592
    replacing the dashboard.    

6
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,596
 this incredible steering wheel 
       is also detachable       

7
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:06,599
       to allow the driver      
  to enter and exit the cockpit 

8
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,200
       quickly and easily.      

9
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,203
       it's, quite simply,      
       designed for speed.      

10
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:18,544
   the indy steering wheel is   
  a complex piece of equipment  

11
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,546
      that puts everything      
   at the driver's fingertips.  

12
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,949
            it starts           
    with a full-scale design,   

13
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:28,354
   customized to the driver's   
  racing style and preferences. 

14
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,156
      the technician aligns     

15
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:32,758
     the traditional racing     
steering wheel with the drawing,

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,228
          and marks it          
     for a complete remodel.    

17
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,831
           he cuts out          
    the leather and foam wrap   

18
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,967
     within the marked lines    

19
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,104
      and saws off a chunk      
     of the aluminum frame.     

20
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:52,377
        he then activates       
      a computerized cutter     

21
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,715
 that carves away a big section 
   of the steering wheel hub.   

22
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:59,118
it also cuts holes for switches.

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,186
       with these changes,      

24
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,389
   the steering wheel is ready  
     to accommodate a panel     

25
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,193
  with over two dozen controls  
           and gauges.          

26
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,329
 next, more computerized tooling

27
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,933
       transforms a sheet       
         of carbon fiber        

28
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:16,802
    into the steering wheel's   
          switch plate.         

29
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:21,340
        it cuts out holes       
    for screws and switches,    

30
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:25,611
      and it creates slots      
for the shift and clutch panels.

31
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,681
      the tool then zigzags     
      around the perimeter      

32
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:32,752
 to trim the switch plate to fit
  the modified steering wheel.  

33
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,958
   with the trimmings removed,  

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,095
    the switch plate is ready   
     for the working parts.     

35
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:46,164
    the next technician plugs   
    the color-coded switches    

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,634
         into the holes         
     and locks them in place    

37
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:52,371
            with nuts           
   and anti-vibration washers.  

38
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,040
         the yellow one         
  is a pit-lane speed limiter.  

39
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,909
      as the name suggests,     

40
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:00,913
  it will limit the car's speed 
        in the pit lane.        

41
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,715
      once all the switches     
      have been installed,      

42
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:07,186
      he runs wires to them     
  and solders the connections.  

43
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,422
  this completes the circuitry. 

44
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,594
    he coats each connection    
     with silicone sealant.     

45
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:19,198
    this weather-proofs them    
 and further dampens vibrations.

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
 and for additional protection, 

47
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,403
 he applies glue to the plastic 
   sheathing around the wires.  

48
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,740
      he adds a rubber boot     
       to each connection.      

49
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,609
      the boot fits loosely     
       around it at first,      

50
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,144
     but, using a heat gun,     

51
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,014
           he shrinks           
 the specially formulated rubber

52
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,415
       to the connection.       

53
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:40,519
    this makes the boot fit     
    like it was made for it.    

54
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,957
     the indy-steering-wheel    
          switch plate          

55
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,760
          is now ready          
     for the shift paddles.     

56
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:52,364
 so next, the technician screws 
 a spacer plate into the slot.  

57
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,701
   this metal spacer slightly   
  elevates the paddle mechanism 

58
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,437
   to give it the right amount  
          of clearance.         

59
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,975
  he screws the paddle assembly 
         to the spacer.         

60
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,713
  he installs the second shift  
 paddle and two clutch paddles. 

61
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,584
   then he inserts the rotary   
     switch for fuel mapping    

62
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,520
         and secures it         
     with a washer and nut.     

63
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:18,590
    this fuel-mapping system    
  will adjust the fuel-air mix  

64
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,360
      to boost or decrease      
          power output.         

65
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,900
he adds little decals with icons
  to the color-coded switches.  

66
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,708
 a radio-transmission icon marks
    the communication switch.   

67
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,214
           he returns           
   to the steering wheel now.   

68
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,683
       he attaches a unit       
       that displays rpm        

69
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,953
      and other information     
 that a normal dash would have. 

70
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:54,760
          he screws it          
 to the exposed aluminum frame. 

71
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,430
     he's now ready to mount    
   the completed switch plate   

72
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,833
     to the steering wheel.     

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,039
     three bolts to the hub     
      secure the assembly.      

74
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,844
           he installs          
    a spring-loaded mechanism   

75
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,778
           at the back          
      of the steering wheel     

76
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,648
         that will allow        
       the steering wheel       

77
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,050
   to be installed or removed   
        in half a second.       

78
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,924
 he tests the two shift paddles 
   and the two clutch paddles   

79
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,959
          and confirms          
     they operate smoothly.     

80
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,566
            finally,            
    he attached dense padding   

81
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,867
    to the steering-wheel hub   

82
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,803
       for a soft landing       
      for the driver's head     

83
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,537
     in the even of a crash.    

84
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,209
 this indy steering wheel costs 
 as much as a small compact car.

85
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,344
  but for the driver and crew,  

86
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,249
   it's worth the investment    
   if it helps win the prize.   

87
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,032
   narrator: people have been   
     dining on edible greens    

88
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,100
     for thousands of years.    

89
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,302
     traditionally collected    
          in the wild,          

90
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,771
     today, there's no need     
       to forage for them       

91
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,573
      because field greens      
  are cultivated commercially.  

92
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,109
     they're mixed, washed,     
          and packaged          

93
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,178
 for the consumer's convenience.

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,715
        it's an easy dish       
        to toss together.       

95
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,854
  packaged mixed greens combine 
       mild-tasting leaves      

96
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,724
   with stronger-tasting ones   

97
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,326
       and crunchy greens       
     with more tender ones.     

98
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,862
        so when it comes        
     to texture and flavor,     

99
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,131
     it's truly a mixed bag.    

100
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,734
     they cultivate up to 20    
    different kinds of greens   

101
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,538
    on this california farm,    
   and they aren't all green.   

102
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,474
          some are red.         

103
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,343
 they plant the various lettuces

104
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:54,613
    according to the recipes    
  for different packaged salads 

105
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:58,950
         so they'll have        
   just the right combination.  

106
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,153
     with regular irrigation    
       and fertilization,       

107
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,689
      the leaves flourish.      

108
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,757
     it makes for a stunning    
      red-and-green display     

109
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,892
          in the field.         

110
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,562
      after 30 to 45 days,      

111
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,899
        these baby greens       
     are ready for harvest.     

112
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,970
   a machine with a long blade  
     moves across the field     

113
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,873
       and literally mows       
       the field greens.        

114
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,379
         the greens flow        
        onto one conveyor       

115
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,315
    and transfer to another.    

116
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,585
  the belt is a metal-mesh one  

117
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,055
    to sift out contaminants    
   like small rocks and twigs.  

118
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,793
           at the end           
    of the sifting conveyor,    

119
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,996
    the salad greens fly off    
     and onto another belt.     

120
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:48,133
this belt serves them up to bins
      on a flatbed trailer,     

121
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,470
   creating an enormous salad   
          in each one.          

122
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,743
     workers cover the bins     
          with plastic          

123
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,814
          and haul them         
  to a nearby processing plant. 

124
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:05,751
           on arrival,          
    the salad greens transfer   

125
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,687
   to a vacuum-cooling chamber  
            to chill.           

126
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,223
   the vacuum causes moisture   
   on the greens to evaporate.  

127
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,759
    as the water evaporates,    

128
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,428
         it absorbs heat        
    to lower the temperature    

129
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,829
      and cool the greens.      

130
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:22,835
   the salad greens then head   
     into an optical sorter.    

131
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,038
              here,             
 computerized cameras and lasers

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
   scan the greens for flaws,   

133
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:31,243
       like discoloration       
      and foreign material.     

134
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,046
   the operator has programmed  
           the system           

135
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,314
to detect flaws or contaminants.

136
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,117
  when the computer finds one,  

137
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:42,721
 it sends a signal to an air jet
         that expels it.        

138
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,859
   some good leaves get lost    
   along the way -- about 3%.   

139
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,528
         it's considered        
       an acceptable loss.      

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,698
 the rejects will be composted. 

141
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,667
   out of the optical sorter,   

142
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,670
      an employee tosses in     
       the bitter greens,       

143
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,006
   like radicchio and frisée.   

144
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:06,078
   this moving salad now heads  
 into a three-part wash system. 

145
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,748
       the first wash tank      
has rolling perforated cylinders

146
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,885
 that keep the greens submerged 
          for washing.          

147
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,487
        they also pick up       
      unwanted tiny leaves      

148
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,422
  and remove them from the mix. 

149
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,492
    the salad greens transfer   
     to a vibrating conveyor    

150
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,094
   that shakes out the water.   

151
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,763
        then they travel        
   through a second wash tank   

152
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,900
and finally receive a third wash
     from overhead sprayers.    

153
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,301
     the washed salad greens    

154
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,372
  fall into plastic containers  
       with perforations.       

155
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:36,241
       they're essentially      
      very large colanders.     

156
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,913
   they transfer each colander  
  to a centrifuge and power up. 

157
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,714
     it spins the colander,     

158
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,383
  and this causes the moisture  
          on the greens         

159
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,652
            to drain            
   through there perforations.  

160
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,388
 this leaves them dry and crisp.

161
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,657
   it is a large-scale version  
      of the salad spinner      

162
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,094
        many people have        
       in their kitchens.       

163
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:05,070
these field greens are now ready
     for the packaging line.    

164
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,341
   it's an entirely mechanized  
system with an endless appetite.

165
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,652
    the greens funnel through   
  a hopper and land in buckets. 

166
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,857
  this is a weighing operation. 

167
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:31,897
         there's a scale        
       under each bucket.       

168
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,232
     when the target weight     
           is reached,          

169
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,035
 the bucket releases the greens.

170
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:41,907
     they slide down chutes     
    into the bagging machine.   

171
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,710
     these salad greens are     
 still living, breathing plants.

172
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,778
          the packaging         
   will slow their respiration  

173
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,515
    and put the aging process   
            on hold.            

174
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,318
  machinery hermetically seals  
         them in plastic        

175
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,055
    to give them a shelf life   
     of 14 days to 19 days.     

176
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,724
   and with that availability,  

177
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:02,794
        there's no excuse       
     not to eat your greens.    

178
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,610
   narrator: wind turbines use  
 an unlimited natural resource, 

179
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,012
the wind, to produce electricity

180
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,147
        without polluting       
        the environment.        

181
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,751
  a turbine consists of a rotor 
     and a massive propeller    

182
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,954
     that spins in the wind     
     on top of a high tower.    

183
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:33,225
 it drives a built-in generator 
   that produces electricity.   

184
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,899
      the higher up you go,     
       the windier it is.       

185
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,767
   so the taller the turbine,   

186
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,370
       the more wind power      
          it harnesses.         

187
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,106
      they may not look it      
        from a distance,        

188
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:52,043
    but wind turbines can be    
 as high as a 20-story building 

189
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,981
        with rotor blades       
   half a football field long.  

190
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,584
      to begin constructing     
      those massive blades,     

191
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,387
         workers prepare        
       fiberglass sheets,       

192
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,991
   each one numbered according  
 to a detailed engineering plan.

193
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,993
    then, following the plan,   

194
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,664
workers lay down specific sheets
     in designated locations    

195
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,367
       in the bottom half       
     of a blade-shaped mold.    

196
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,941
           for a blade          
     to be free of defects,     

197
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,610
           each sheet           
    must lie perfectly flat.    

198
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,412
   so, using a smoothing tool,  

199
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,082
   workers remove air bubbles   
          and creases.          

200
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,888
 the surface of the mold cavity 

201
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,023
           is treated           
    with a non-stick coating.   

202
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,827
   this will prevent the blade  
    from adhering to the mold   

203
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,295
      when they extract it.     

204
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:47,299
  after placing all the sheets  
 in the bottom half of the mold,

205
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,502
        workers construct       
   the upper part of the blade  

206
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,640
 by laying fiberglass sheets on 
 the top half of the blade mold.

207
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:58,110
   again, every single sheet    
   is numbered and positioned   

208
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,578
            according           
    to the blade-design plan.   

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,651
  an area of the mold can have  
 from for to 120 layered sheets 

210
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,987
 of varying thickness, weights, 
           and weaves,          

211
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,590
            depending           
   on how structurally strong   

212
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:14,159
     that part of the blade     
           has to be.           

213
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,862
     to make specific areas     
           more rigid,          

214
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:20,332
  between layers of fiberglass  
       they install balsa,      

215
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,433
 an extremely lightweight wood. 

216
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,137
       cut channels enable      
        the balsa panels        

217
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,605
      to flex to the shape      
          of the blade.         

218
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,141
          the channels          
      are also the pathways     

219
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,412
 through which the bonding agent
         epoxy will flow        

220
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:36,615
      to saturate the wood      
   and surrounding fiberglass.  

221
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,955
    precision in the setup of   
fiberglass and wood is critical.

222
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,893
        the process takes       
 a team of six workers 16 hours.

223
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,496
     they close up the mold     

224
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,366
    by lowering the top half    
      onto the bottom half.     

225
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,039
   then they inject the epoxy.  

226
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:07,779
simultaneously, workers heat the
mold to 158 degrees fahrenheit. 

227
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,647
 this aids the chemical reaction

228
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,049
             between            
  the epoxy's two components -- 

229
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,586
     a resin and a hardener.    

230
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:18,724
         after 9½ hours,        
    the epoxy is fully cured.   

231
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,258
      with overhead cranes,     

232
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,127
         they lift away         
    the top half of the mold,   

233
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,864
    revealing a turbine blade   
 measuring up to 60 yards long, 

234
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,236
  weighing in at about 10 tons. 

235
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,279
using lifting devices positioned
     at specific locations,     

236
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,149
  they slowly extract the blade 
from the bottom half of the mold

237
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:52,057
     and lay it onto a stand    
      to cool for 4½ hours.     

238
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,232
 workers then transfer the blade
  to a mill-and-drill machine,  

239
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,770
    which shapes the open end   
  to align with the rotor hub.  

240
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:08,372
  the machine also drills holes 
      for the 54 pin bolts      

241
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,909
   that will fasten the blade   
           to the hub.          

242
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,246
    next, workers grind away    
   the seam of hardened epoxy   

243
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,449
that formed where the two halves
         of the mold met        

244
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:20,518
      and sand the surface      
        perfectly smooth.       

245
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,121
    then they spray the blade   
     with a coat of primer,     

246
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,324
       which they let cure      
         for six hours.         

247
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,860
           then a coat          
      of epoxy-based paint,     

248
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,796
        letting that cure       
     for about eight hours.     

249
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,533
       then workers insert      
       those 54 pin bolts       

250
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,603
  made of a particularly strong 
         grade of steel         

251
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,205
        and tighten them        
      with a torque wrench.     

252
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,543
     after this, they weigh     
   each blade on a floor scale  

253
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:48,213
     and group three blades     
  of similar weight per turbine 

254
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,483
     to ensure the rotation     
        will be balanced.       

255
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,886
       the install a cover      
over the opened end of the blade

256
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,222
        to prevent debris       
       from falling inside      

257
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,491
        during transport        
        to the wind farm.       

258
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,963
    upon arrival, crews bolt    
  three blades to a rotor hub,  

259
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,233
      then hoist the rotor      
 to the top of the turbine tower

260
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,102
 and connect it to the nacelle. 

261
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:29,120
      narrator: the nacelle     
  is the part of a wind turbine 

262
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,323
   which transforms wind power  
        into electricity.       

263
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,191
  with the rotor mounted to it, 

264
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,660
       the nacelle houses       
       a giant drivetrain.      

265
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,397
  it multiplies the rotational  
  speed of the spinning blades  

266
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,933
        then transfers it       
     to a massive generator,    

267
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,568
   which produces electricity.  

268
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:50,008
     a wind turbine's rotor     
     is made of three blades    

269
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,342
       attached to a hub.       

270
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,212
      the hub alone weighs      
       more than 30 tons.       

271
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:58,750
  it's cast from ductile iron,  
  a strong grade of cast iron.  

272
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,422
at the factory, they use a crane
       to hoist and affix       

273
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,958
         the hub casting        
     to an assembly fixture.    

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,963
   this fixture holds the hub   
securely in a suspended position

275
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,299
 while workers mount components 
             to it,             

276
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,434
            starting            
   with three blade bearings.   

277
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,103
         a blade bearing        
     is a giant ball bearing    

278
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,105
 to which the blade is attached.

279
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:24,241
        when it rotates,        
       the blade pitches,       

280
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,377
    meaning it changes angle.   

281
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,046
    blades need to be pitched   
    to better catch the wind    

282
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,783
  and to spin at optimal speed. 

283
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:37,588
each bearing attaches to the hub
       with 54 huge bolts.      

284
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,192
   the next hub components --   
      three accumulators --     

285
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,261
   one for each blade bearing.  

286
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:47,065
      an accumulator stores     
  hydraulic oil under pressure. 

287
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,868
         this oil moves         
      hydraulic cylinders,      

288
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,538
 which rotate the blade bearing 
       to pitch the blade.      

289
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,141
        workers assemble        
        each accumulator,       

290
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,744
        mount its cover,        

291
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,581
         then install it        
       on a blade bearing.      

292
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,423
   once all three accumulators  

293
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,891
      and other components      
         are installed,         

294
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,293
      the hub is finished.      

295
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,829
         they remove it         
    from the assembly fixture   

296
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,431
   and put a fiberglass cover   
        over each bearing       

297
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,133
 to protect the workings inside.

298
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:27,104
 meanwhile, in the same factory,

299
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,041
        workers assemble        
   the wind turbine's nacelle.  

300
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,509
       first, they lay out      

301
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,379
       the bottom section       
      of its steel housing,     

302
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,582
       then they assemble       
         the yaw system,        

303
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,919
 the key component that enables 
      the nacelle and rotor     

304
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,721
     to rotate 360 degrees.     

305
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,723
           they mount           
     a large stationary gear    

306
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,992
          in the center         
   of the system's mainframe.   

307
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,596
    then, on the reverse side   
        of the mainframe,       

308
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,998
  they install eight yaw gears. 

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,570
 these smaller gears engage the 
 large gear on the other side.  

310
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:05,410
 fully assembled, the mainframe 
    weighs more than 22 tons.   

311
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:09,280
 workers hoist it with a crane, 
         then install it        

312
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,550
     into the bottom section    
 of the nacelle's steel housing.

313
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,885
    they connect the gearbox    

314
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,620
           to the rest          
  of the nacelle's drivetrain.  

315
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,490
it works like a car transmission
           in reverse.          

316
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,694
   while the car transmission   
takes combustion-produced energy

317
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,763
  and turns it into rotation -- 
   the car wheel's turning --   

318
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,299
     the nacelle drivetrain     
        takes rotation --       

319
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,435
       the blades spinning      
         in the wind --         

320
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,370
          and turns it          
     into electrical energy.    

321
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,838
  those spinning blades rotate  

322
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,975
        the drivetrain's        
      massive steel shaft.      

323
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:40,445
 the opposite end of that shaft 
    connects to the gearbox.    

324
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,248
       the gear's multiply      
     the speed of rotation,     

325
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,849
   rotating the second shaft,   

326
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,118
     which they now connect     
         to a generator,        

327
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,387
        installed inside        
      the nacelle housing.      

328
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,056
        the second shaft        
      powers the generator,     

329
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,858
   which produces electricity.  

330
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,262
 after connecting the drivetrain
        to the generator,       

331
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,397
         workers install        
 the top section of the housing,

332
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,368
     as well as access doors    
      for maintenance work.     

333
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,807
           technicians          
      conduct various tests     

334
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,609
          to make sure          
    everything runs properly.   

335
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,547
here, they are verifying the fan
    that cools the generator.   

336
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,361
 the finished nacelle looks like
      a mammoth aa battery.     

337
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,030
       it weighs 85 tons.       

338
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,867
       nearly half of that      
       is the drivetrain.       

339
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,906
         the plant ships        
  both the nacelle and the hub  

340
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,376
   separately to the wind farm  
    by either truck or rail.    

341
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,712
     the blades are shipped     
           to the farm          

342
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:50,949
      from another factory      
 and the tower from yet another.

343
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,857
    once all the parts arrive   
  on site, assembly can begin.  

344
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,459
  crews first direct the tower. 

345
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,396
then they hoist the nacelle all 
the way to the top and mount it.

346
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,799
         on the ground,         
     they assemble the rotor    

347
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,201
    by installing the blades    
           in the hub.          

348
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:14,205
    then they hoist the rotor   
     to the top of the tower    

349
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,474
  and mount it to the nacelle.  

350
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,545
     and from that point on,    
   the wind does all the work.  

351
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,292
