2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,974
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,186
   narrator: used for windows,  
     doors, and partitions,     

4
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,657
     patterned glass panels     
 add beauty and light to a room.

5
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,259
        but their purpose       
    is more than decorative.    

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,862
    the designs in the glass    
     also obscure the view,     

7
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:06,131
     making patterned glass     
  an effective privacy screen.  

8
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,635
        they let light in       
    and keep prying eyes out.   

9
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,006
      with patterned glass,     

10
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:17,209
    windows become something    
 to look<i> at</i> rather than<i> through.</i>

11
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,546
 there are a variety of designs 
  and textures to choose from,  

12
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,749
   offering different degrees   
           of privacy.          

13
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,219
   at the heart of the process  
   are engraved metal rollers   

14
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,088
      that transfer designs     
           onto glass.          

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,491
        before production       
         can even begin,        

16
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,293
   this roller rotates through  
            a chamber           

17
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,964
  where grit blasts off grease  
            and dirt.           

18
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,833
  if the designs on the roller  
          are damaged,          

19
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,035
 they shave off the outer skin, 

20
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,105
    exposing a smooth surface   
        for re-engraving.       

21
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,307
but that isn't always necessary.

22
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:54,313
  small problems can be fixed,  
so they circle those for repair.

23
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,582
            some need           
  no refurbishment whatsoever,  

24
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,717
         so they move on        
        to the next step.       

25
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,054
        a worker brushes        
      a polishing compound      

26
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,256
    onto the printing roller.   

27
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,058
      a buffing wheel rubs      
          the compound          

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,927
        into the roller's       
         chrome surface,        

29
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:10,963
       taking it from dull      
        to a high shine.        

30
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,067
           meanwhile,           
 at another part of the factory,

31
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,204
 craftsmen repair trouble spots 
        on other rollers.       

32
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,873
            the work            
   has to blend in perfectly.   

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,213
   the craftsmen do their jobs  
         with a finesse         

34
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,818
  that comes from natural skill 
     and years of practice.     

35
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,422
     one false move, and the    
 entire pattern could be ruined.

36
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,290
 but the touch-ups are perfect, 

37
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,827
 and these rollers are now ready
    for the production line.    

38
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,897
      the raw ingredients       
      for the glass panels      

39
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,166
    are stored in huge silos.   

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,769
   these ingredients all come   
        from the earth --       

41
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:54,173
   sand, limestone, dolomite,   
    soda ash, and salt cake.    

42
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,509
   here's a sampling in a jar.  

43
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,244
       conveyor belts feed      
  a mixed batch of ingredients  

44
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,447
      to a roaring furnace.     

45
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,650
      they add waste glass      
 and recycle it into the process

46
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,652
      to reduce the effect      
      on the environment.       

47
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,256
              fired             
  at 2,900 degrees fahrenheit,  

48
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,324
  the ingredients melt quickly. 

49
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:16,328
now a molten mass, it circulates
      in a looped pathway.      

50
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,333
an inspector checks the melting 
status of the glass ingredients,

51
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,470
 as well as the flow of gas fuel
      to fire the furnace.      

52
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:28,274
     this furnace is burning    
  24 hours a day, 7 days a week 

53
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:30,743
  and is monitored constantly.  

54
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:36,148
      the hot, liquid glass     
 now flows between two rollers, 

55
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,084
      one of them engraved.     

56
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,686
   the rollers imprint designs  
         onto the glass         

57
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,555
         and squeeze it         
     to its final thickness.    

58
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,624
  the glass rapidly solidifies, 

59
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,226
       fixing the pattern       
     in the ribbon of glass.    

60
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,895
     it then travels through    

61
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,631
         a 65-foot-long         
    temperature-control zone.   

62
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,900
        the glass ribbon        
      is exposed to flames      

63
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,303
   to relieve stresses caused   
  by the manufacturing process. 

64
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,706
    this is called annealing.   

65
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,642
     the glass slowly cools     
     as it leaves the zone.     

66
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,178
     this seals in strength     
         and durability         

67
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,415
  so it can now be cut cleanly  
       without fracturing.      

68
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,118
       this cutter scores       
      the glass lengthwise      

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,387
       but doesn't cut it       
      all the way through.      

70
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,892
    the scored line maps out    
 the desired width of the glass.

71
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,797
 another cutter moves to and fro

72
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,399
            to create           
     horizontal score lines.    

73
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,802
   these score lines establish  
           the length           

74
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,004
 of the patterned glass panels. 

75
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,209
      then a roller pops up     

76
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:40,479
   and breaks the glass along   
   the horizontal score lines.  

77
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,017
            the sides           
    of the glass now collide    

78
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,219
       with little wheels       
       known as bonkers,        

79
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,189
   which snap the glass along   
    the lateral score lines.    

80
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,160
   the waste glass falls down   
             a chute            

81
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,762
to rollers that bust it to bits.

82
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,897
  these bits are called cullet, 

83
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,767
     and they'll be recycled    
         into new glass.        

84
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,272
            a worker            
   now backlights glass panels  

85
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,109
    and examines their finish   
           for flaws.           

86
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,644
     this solar glass panel     
       has a matte finish.      

87
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,181
  compared to the small sample  
    of standard, clear glass,   

88
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,583
      it's less reflective,     

89
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,852
        allowing more of        
the sun's energy to be captured.

90
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,389
     minerals high in iron      
     produce greenish glass     

91
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,457
     that's light-absorbent.    

92
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,826
        for solar glass,        
    they go easy on the iron    

93
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,996
     to produce white glass     
     that transmits light.      

94
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:35,000
   a carrier with suction cups  
 stacks the glass for shipping. 

95
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,839
       now all that's left      
     is the window shopping.    

96
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,022
      narrator: road cases      
    are designed for the job    

97
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,091
         of transporting        
      sensitive equipment,      

98
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,894
    like musical instruments    
       and audio systems.       

99
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,363
      these wheeled trunks      
    are tough on the outside,   

100
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,899
 with cushy foam on the inside. 

101
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,366
        with road cases,        

102
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,171
     the gear arrives intact    
   and ready to rock 'n' roll.  

103
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,376
     behind every superstar,    

104
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,312
         there is plenty        
     of this custom luggage.    

105
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,382
    each case is designed for   
a particular piece of equipment,

106
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,918
  like an audio-mixing console. 

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,587
            the case            
    is being made to measure.   

108
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,856
    they load the dimensions    
      of the audio console      

109
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,191
         into a computer        

110
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,793
         and then design        
    a virtual case around it    

111
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,896
              using             
   three-dimensional software.  

112
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,803
    once a customer approves    
    the computer blueprint,     

113
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,939
     they're ready to build.    

114
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,009
      workers roll adhesive     
    onto thick birch plywood.   

115
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:51,777
   they coat the entire sheet.  

116
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,948
    the plywood is now ready    

117
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,350
           to receive           
   a thermoplastic outer skin.  

118
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:02,153
  they align the thermoplastic  
with the adhesive-coated plywood

119
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,223
    and lower it into place.    

120
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,958
   they feed the thermoplastic  
       and plywood layers       

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,361
           to rollers           
  that squeeze out any bubbles  

122
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,497
      for an airtight bond.     

123
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:19,171
   then the heat from this hot  
  press activates the adhesive, 

124
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:23,308
 and it cures for an even better
      bond to the plywood.      

125
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,846
    the result is a laminated   
  thermoplastic plywood sheet.  

126
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,985
 next, a computer-guided router 

127
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:35,521
         carves through         
      the laminated sheet,      

128
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,590
  following the design drawn up 
         in cyberspace.         

129
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,393
          this produces         
      the exterior panels,      

130
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,397
    each one precisely sized    
   for the audio-console case.  

131
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,535
 the router also cuts out holes 
 for latches and other fittings.

132
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,537
    a worker pieces together    
           the panels           

133
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,307
    to form the basic carcass   
          of the case.          

134
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,410
     he tacks them together     
           temporarily          

135
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,878
       with a staple gun.       

136
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,949
  he'll join them permanently   
  with extruded aluminum trim.  

137
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:10,155
  he preps the aluminum edging  
  by punching rivet holes in it 

138
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,524
     at strategic locations.    

139
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:20,499
      he also cuts notches      
 for bending it around corners. 

140
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,901
         he's now ready         
  to install the aluminum trim. 

141
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:27,172
he can actually bend the corners
   by hand for a perfect fit.   

142
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,308
    the edging gives the case   
        a tailored look,        

143
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,312
 and once riveted to the panels,
    it will hold it together.   

144
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,782
   he drills through the holes  
           in the trim          

145
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,519
   to make corresponding holes  
    in the laminated plywood.   

146
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,454
        he inserts rivets       
         into the holes.        

147
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,857
          these rivets          
 have mandrels attached to them.

148
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,926
    he drives those mandrels    
       through the rivets,      

149
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,729
     causing them to expand     
    around the drilled holes    

150
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,198
       and secure the trim      
          to the trunk.         

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,733
       with the job done,       

152
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:58,070
     the mandrel breaks off     
       and is disposed of.      

153
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,939
 with the case now held together
       by the metal trim,       

154
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,608
   he rivets the latch to it,   

155
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,878
        and then it's on        
     to the inner framework.    

156
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,614
       the plywood parts        
       have also been cut       

157
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,482
   with computerized precision  

158
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,418
        designed to hold        
       the audio console.       

159
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,753
      he reinforces a piece     
         called a cheek         

160
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,289
   with a thick block of wood.  

161
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,158
  this cheek is one of the two  

162
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,628
        that will cradle        
       the audio console.       

163
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,498
    he bulks up the wide end    

164
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,967
     with plywood copies of     
 the cheek's contoured profile, 

165
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,904
  gluing them and nailing them  
        to the main part        

166
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,541
so this reinforcement job holds.

167
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,115
         he spray-paints        
  the cheek substructure black, 

168
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,684
      giving it a durable,      
        textured finish.        

169
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,859
 he fits the cheeks in the case,
        one on each side,       

170
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,894
  and bolts them into position. 

171
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,732
 another worker hot-glues blocks
            of foam,            

172
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,267
      each specifically cut     

173
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,102
   to fit together like pieces  
           of a puzzle          

174
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,205
as he installs them in the case.

175
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,875
        all this padding        
     will cushion the impact    

176
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,745
    of any bumps on the road    
     or backstage jostling.     

177
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,017
         he even covers         
   the top of a plywood drawer  

178
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,319
      made for a keyboard.      

179
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,292
           they slide           
    the audio-mixing console    

180
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,094
          into the case         
       to try it for size.      

181
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,231
      from start to finish,     

182
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,767
  it's taken about three hours  
     to make this road case.    

183
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,237
   it should last for as long   
  as the audio equipment does,  

184
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,574
 but it all depends on how rough
      it gets on the road.

187

         the characters

00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,664

   the puppet ever so slightly

takes a large and talented team,

199
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,754
     which includes writers,    
      directors, animators,

          camera crews,

 and, of course, puppet makers, 

202
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,596
      who create, maintain,     
     and repair the puppets.

 how stop-frame animation works,

204
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,035
    let's rewind this scene,    

205
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,139
        which stars timmy       
   and features a red balloon.  

206
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,710
       the director takes       
       the writer's script      

207
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,912
   and breaks down each scene   
         of the episode         

208
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,981
     into a series of shots.    

209
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,117
 this shooting script then goes 
    to the storyboard artist,   

210
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:03,388
who draws each shot of the scene
on a digital storyboard tablet. 

211
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,333
         for each scene,        
      the director prepares     

212
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,336
      a set plan detailing      
    the background elements,    

213
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,505
     the puppet placement,      
     and the camera angles.     

214
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:27,346
   the storyboard artist sends  
   his drawings to the editor,  

215
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:30,415
   who works with the director  
 to edit them into an animatic, 

216
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,452
     a still-drawing version    
         of the episode.

the dialogue in a sound studio. 

219
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,367
       now the editor cuts      
that dialogue into the animatic.

220

 the visuals in this soundtrack 
 must be perfectly synchronized,

221
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,906
      because the animators     
      will use the animatic     

222
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,641
    as a frame-by-frame guide

239
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,352

      they open up the mold     
    and extract the casting.    

242
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,970
        they drill a hole

249
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,410
      when the paint dries,     

250
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,679
  they drill another tiny hole  
   at the base of the balloon   

251
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,347
       and insert a strand      

252
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,750
 of flexible copper wire wrapped
        in cotton thread.       

253
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,853
   this is the balloon string.  

254
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,026
  the team of animators shoot   
  several scenes concurrently.  

255
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,028
           therefore,           
    in the puppet department,   

256
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,364
  model makers produce multiple 
   puppets for each character,  

257
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,101
 plus lots of extra body parts. 

258
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,042
   certain puppet body parts,   
    such as hands and wings,    

259
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,046
      are made of silicone      
  with a wire skeleton within.  

260
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,048
     after forming the wire     
            to shape            

261
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,317
          and applying          
    a base coat of silicone,    

262
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,986
    the puppet maker lays it    
       in a two-part mold,      

263
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,656
    then fills both cavities    
         with silicone.         

264
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,727
     she closes the mold...     

265
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,196
     clamps it tightly shut,    

266
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,933
     and leaves the silicone    
        to set overnight.       

267
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,871
          the flexible,         
    wire skeleton at the core   

268
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:44,075
enables the animator to position
  a hand or wing various ways.  

269
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,160
            narrator:           
    in stop-frame animation,    

270
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,496
   the more movable the puppet  
    and its facial features,    

271
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,499
        the more lifelike       
 the animated character appears.

272
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,101
       the animator moves       
    the puppet incrementally    

273
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,169
   for each frame they shoot,   

274
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,042
   and 25 such frames produce   
  just one second of animation. 

275
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,516
          timmy's torso         

276
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:27,385
   is a polyurethane-foam core  
     dressed in a wool coat.    

277
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,721
         it has channels        
    for interchangeable wires   

278
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,390
 that support his head and arms.

279
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,392
   his head is made of resin,   

280
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,529
      his arm silicone over     
        a wire skeleton.        

281
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,330
  timmy and his friends' faces  

282
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,733
    can express a wide range    
           of emotions          

283
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,336
             thanks             
   to interchangeable mouths,   

284
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,337
    flexible ears and blinks,   

285
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,339
          an assortment         
     of exchangeable eyelids    

286
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,776
      conveying expressions     
   from wide-eyed to cockeyed.  

287
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,281
  these facial features attach  
       either magnetically      

288
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:00,519
      or with tacky wax --      
 a flexible, quick-release glue.

289
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,022
   the puppet-maintenance team  
      packs each character      

290
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,157
 and its parts in a travel box, 

291
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,828
  then sends it to the animator 
      on the studio floor.      

292
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,162
        during shooting,        

293
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,832
    the animator changes the    
 facial expressions as required.

294
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,236
  while their work does indeed  
 require great technical skill, 

295
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:22,106
 the animators are actors who,  
 under the director's guidance, 

296
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,109
         perform through        
 the puppets they bring to life.

297
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,512
     the puppet's legs must     
        be sturdy enough        

298
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,981
      to support the weight     
        of the upper body       

299
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,582
  when the puppet is standing,  

300
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,050
       so the leg skeleton      

301
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,055
 is made of metal rods connected
  with ball-and-socket joints.  

302
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,992
    the feet are metal plates   
    hinged to allow movement.   

303
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,128
     just like the flexible,    
         wire skeletons,        

304
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,264
       this metal skeleton      
      also goes into a mold     

305
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,933
   to be encased in silicone.   

306
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,803
         the arms attach        
 with square-section brass tubes

307
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,039
             so they            
   can be easily interchanged   

308
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,274
        with a few turns        
        of an allen key.        

309
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,745
    certain puppet movements    
        require rigging.        

310
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,147
        a rig is a device       
     that enables animators     

311
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,817
       to raise the puppet      
    off the floor of the set    

312
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,553
to perform jumping and skipping.

313
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,224
          the animator          
     can incrementally lift     

314
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,094
 or lower the rig to any height 
       and lock it there.       

315
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,169
   there are many preparations  
     before shooting begins,    

316
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,503
        such as lighting,       

317
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,573
      puppet positioning...     

318
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,009
        and set dressing.       

319
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:36,981
   using the animatic playing   
  on a monitor as a reference,  

320
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,618
the director and camera operator
         frame the shot.        

321
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,260
   meanwhile, the set dressers  
      prepare the next set,     

322
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,663
       gathering whatever       
    scenic objects they need    

323
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,632
   from the set-dressing kit.   

324
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,671
    to create these objects,    

325
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:03,274
 artists first sculpt the shapes
    out of modeling material.   

326
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:06,010
       they create a mold       
 from which they produce copies 

327
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,413
          in fiberglass         
     or quick-setting resin.    

328
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,783
   then they paint the copies.  

329
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,425
      with the set dressed      
          and approved,         

330
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,094
     the animator can begin.    

331
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,297
    with great care referring   
        to the animatic,        

332
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,400
 he positions the rigged puppet.

333
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,641
then, with the push of a button,
       he shoots a frame,       

334
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,779
     or, in animation lingo,    
        grabs the frame.        

335
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,315
         next, he moves         
    the puppet incrementally    

336
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,152
    and makes slight changes    
     to body positioning...     

337
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,457
   ...and grabs another frame.  

338
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:57,328
      25 consecutive frames     
 equal one second of animation. 

339
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,598
       the animator's art       
 is knowing how and by how much 

340
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,668
       to move the puppet       
  to create lifelike movement.  

341
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,405
         to get special         
      close-up facial shots     

342
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,275
  that they'll later intercut   
  with the full-body sequence,  

343
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,610
  they sometimes set the puppet 

344
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,514
  on a rig positioned directly  
     in front of the camera.    

345
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,486
once they've shot the animation,

346
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,621
     they take what's called    
           a plate --           

347
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,892
 a shot of the set with puppets,
    props, and rigs removed.    

348
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,628
  they send the plate digitally 
      to the editing suite,     

349
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,098
      where the editor uses     
the visuals to cover up the rig,

350
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,835
     essentially erasing it     
           from view.           

351
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:39,904
          this process          
    is called compositing --    

352
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,640
          a little bit          
  of behind-the-scenes artistry 

353
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,644
      to create a whole lot     
       of onscreen magic.       

354
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,613
           [ laughs ]           

355
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,251
        [ laughing ] baa!       

356
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,419
              ooh!              

357
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,394
      narrator: if you have     
  any comments about the show,
