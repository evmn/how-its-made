00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,157
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,294
...horse-drawn carriages...

3
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,400
...artificial eyes...

4
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,338
...dog and cat food...

5
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,044
...and mirrors.

6
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,187
nothing takes you back to the past

7
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,390
quite like a ride in a horse-drawn carriage,

8
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,995
a timeless vehicle in both appearance and construction.

9
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,065
building one today still requires the expertise

10
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,533
of several traditional craftspeople,

11
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,337
from ironworkers to wheelwrights.

12
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,740
the carriage's turning mechanism
is a fifth wheel

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,011
that is positioned horizontally
above the two front wheels.

14
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,948
workers weld the fifth wheel to the carriage's steel frame

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,552
then weld the boarding steps to the frame.

16
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:30,488
until now the frame has been positioned upside down.

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,626
now they turn it right side up to install the driver's seat.

18
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,561
first they measure carefully

19
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,231
to ensure it's perfectly centered.

20
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,967
then they weld it in place.

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,169
once the frame is complete,

22
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,840
it goes through an acid wash to remove any residue.

23
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:54,580
then they buff the welded joints
to smooth out their surface.

24
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,649
the carriage has drum brakes.

25
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,185
workers install them onto the axle

26
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:05,190
then assemble the steel springs
that make up the suspension

27
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,259
and bolt them onto the axle as well.

28
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:13,298
next, they connect the brake line.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,135
then they install the whole assembly

30
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,471
under the carriage's frame.

31
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,940
like in the olden days,

32
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,008
they make the wheels out of wood.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,946
metal isn't flexible enough to withstand bumps in the road.

34
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,281
they use ash

35
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:33,552
because it's a very hard wood that doesn't rot easily.

36
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,756
workers position 16 spokes around a steel hub.

37
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,758
they clamp the spokes in place,

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,228
compressing them against the hub.

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,798
then they secure them with nuts and bolts.

40
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,509
next, they mark the spokes in two places.

41
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,580
the first line shows how long to cut each spoke,

42
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,850
the second line how far to dowel the end.

43
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,120
to form the dowel,

44
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,389
they first shape the end into a cone.

45
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,294
then the cone into a dowel.

46
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,932
those doweled spokes will fit into corresponding holes

47
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,536
they now drill into two semicircular strips of wood.

48
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,807
the strips form what's called the fellow,

49
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,043
the round part of the wheel.

50
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,281
workers tighten the hub

51
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,985
then press a steel band called a channel against the fellow.

52
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,692
they cut the channel to size.

53
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,431
then weld the ends together.

54
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,700
finally, they buff the joint smooth.

55
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,837
next, they drill eight holes through the channel

56
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,505
then, using a tapering tool,

57
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,841
thread the holes to fit the bolts

58
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,710
that bind the channel to the fellow.

59
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,714
finally, they tighten the bolts
with a special gun.

60
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,784
the tires are made of rubber.

61
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,786
they contain two steel wires

62
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,788
to hold them in place over the wheel.

63
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,191
workers grease the channel of the now-painted wheel

64
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,794
so that the tire will slip on easily.

65
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,129
then they mount the wheel

66
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,398
on the automated tire-installation machine,

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,066
which pulls on the wires,

68
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,436
installing the tire tightly over the wheel.

69
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,141
they solder the wire ends together

70
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,211
using bronze solder for a stronger joint.

71
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,349
then -- here comes the high-tech part --

72
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,552
they bang the wheel on the ground four or five times

73
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,555
until the distance between the tire ends closes,

74
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,059
covering the soldered wires inside.

75
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,965
a tap of the hammer followed by a final bang

76
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,501
ensures the tire joint is secure.

77
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,503
now they can mount the wheels onto the axles

78
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:09,775
and install the axles under the body of the carriage.

79
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,553
after testing the fifth wheel and the brakes...

80
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,592
...it's time to apply the finishing artistic touches.

81
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:39,338
all they need now is a little horsepower.

82
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,882
narrator: the ancient romans and egyptians

83
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,418
fashioned artificial eyes out of painted clay.

84
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,420
by the 1500s,

85
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,356
europeans started making them out of enameled gold

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,891
and soon out of glass,

87
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:03,895
which remained the norm for hundreds of years.

88
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,899
today most artificial eyes are made of acrylic.

89
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:14,238
if you've lost an eye in an accident or to a disease,

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,708
a specialist known as an ocularist

91
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,044
can fit you with an artificial eye.

92
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,381
you can get a ready-made model or a custom-made prosthesis,

93
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,118
like the one for which this patient is being fitted.

94
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,654
no two people's eye sockets are the same,

95
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,524
so the first step is to take an impression.

96
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,926
after inserting an impression tray,

97
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,395
they inject a material called alginate,

98
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,931
filling the entire socket cavity.

99
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:44,268
after 90 seconds, the alginate sets,

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,005
and they can remove the hardened impression.

101
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,375
they place the impression in a mold.

102
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,947
and pour in a type of plaster.

103
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,016
when the plaster has hardened,

104
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,686
they remove the impression tray
and then the impression itself.

105
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:06,157
what's left in the mold is a plaster replica of the socket.

106
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,028
now they put a wad of acrylic plastic dough into the mold...

107
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,899
...lock the mold into a press,

108
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,169
and submerge it in a high-pressure curing unit

109
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,838
for 25 minutes.

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,907
then they cool the mold in cold water.

111
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,510
here's the original impression

112
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,647
compared to the acrylic model they've just cast.

113
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,516
this model is called the fitting shape

114
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,984
because they use it

115
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,455
to fit and mark the positioning
of the fake iris.

116
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,794
they accentuate the markings,

117
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,398
then attach a peg with a drop of wax.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,867
the peg indicates the natural angle of the iris

119
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,670
when the patient is looking forward.

120
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,339
next, they add wax around the perimeter

121
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,340
to enlarge the fitting shape.

122
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,944
this excess will give the ocularist

123
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,214
some room to work with for the final sizing.

124
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,750
now they take this marked and enlarged fitting shape

125
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,619
and make a plaster mold.

126
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,087
they will later use that mold

127
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,424
to cast the actual artificial eye.

128
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,159
but first they have to make the iris.

129
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,296
they take a curved, black acrylic disc

130
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,832
and paint it as realistically as possible

131
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,501
with high-quality artist oils.

132
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:27,505
the patient has to be present so they can match the real eye.

133
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,908
next, they glue an acrylic cornea

134
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,045
with an appropriate-sized pupil
onto the painted iris.

135
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,313
at this point,

136
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,649
the artificial iris is half an inch in diameter.

137
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,719
if the patient's real iris is smaller,

138
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,455
they trim down the replica to match.

139
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,392
the iris then goes into the plaster mold

140
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,727
covered with white acrylic dough.

141
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,731
after the same high-pressure curing process as before,

142
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,734
out comes the artificial eye

143
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,804
covered with excess white acrylic.

144
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,673
they trim off that excess and the peg

145
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,276
using a grinding tool and a cutter.

146
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,545
this refines the shape

147
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,081
and exposes the iris buried underneath.

148
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,151
they smooth the surface against a grinding stone

149
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,954
and verify the measurements.

150
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,757
then, using hard coloring pencils,

151
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,959
they add finishing touches to the iris

152
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,027
and draw blood vessels.

153
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,764
they label the eye with the patient's initials

154
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,032
and then apply an acrylic coating

155
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,968
to seal the pencil marks.

156
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,977
to create veins with some dimension,

157
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,978
they use the same acrylic coating

158
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,715
to stick on some delicate silk threads.

159
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,990
once they're satisfied

160
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,593
the artificial eye is a perfect match,

161
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,129
they seal the artwork with another acrylic coating.

162
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,131
once that cures,

163
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,936
they polish the eye to a shine with a cotton wheel.

164
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,739
the shapes and colors of artificial eyes are endless

165
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,811
because patients' eye sockets and irises vary greatly,

166
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,480
as do their scleras, the white of the eye.

167
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:21,352
this artificial eye, or ocular prosthesis, is ready.

168
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,756
the final step is to ensure that the fit is perfect.

169
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,159
the patient's ocular muscles attach to the implant,

170
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,695
enabling his artificial eye

171
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,998
to move in unison with his real eye.

172
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,911
narrator: so much for feeding fido scraps from the table.

173
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,713
today's pet food

174
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:52,050
is the stuff of sophisticated nutritional science.

175
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,852
it's about protein, carbohydrates,

176
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,256
vitamins, minerals -- a well-balanced diet.

177
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:02,327
want to bet some dogs and cats eat healthier than their owners?

178
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,667
the formulas for dog and cat food differ

179
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,135
because dogs and cats

180
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,671
have different nutritional requirements.

181
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,206
cats, for instance,

182
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,343
need more fat and protein in their diet than dogs do.

183
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,279
but the basic ingredients that factories grind up

184
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,881
to make dog and cat food are similar.

185
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,519
first, corn kernels.

186
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:41,232
then cereals, such as barley...

187
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,701
wheat...

188
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,369
and rice.

189
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,706
workers weigh the ingredients, grind them in a mill,

190
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,842
then combine everything in a mixer

191
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,044
until they have an even and well-blended powder.

192
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:59,116
a machine called the extruder transforms that powder

193
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,186
into bite-sized pieces of pet food.

194
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,555
it steam-coats the mixture,

195
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,592
then forces it through dies at high pressure.

196
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,129
the dies shape it, the way the tip of a pastry bag

197
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,832
shapes icing into swirls or roses.

198
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,068
check out this dog-bone die.

199
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,206
as the continuous stream of shaped mixture exits the die,

200
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,709
a spinning knife cuts it into pieces.

201
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,685
the company has different dies to produce different shapes.

202
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,859
this is a batch of round pieces.

203
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:51,435
next stop, a hot-air dryer for 25 minutes.

204
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,972
it heats the pieces to 300 degrees fahrenheit

205
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,374
to draw out the moisture,

206
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,144
then cools them at room temperature.

207
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,854
once the pieces exit the dryer,
they enter a revolving drum,

208
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,523
where they're sprayed with fat and flavoring.

209
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,660
the fat is designed to add food energy

210
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,729
while the flavoring gives the bland pieces

211
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,198
an appetizing odor and taste --

212
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,834
appetizing for pets, that is.

213
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,009
the rotation ensures the pieces
get coated evenly.

214
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:42,220
from here, the pieces go into storage silos.

215
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,889
when they leave the silos for bagging,

216
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,792
the machinery screens out any crumbs.

217
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,899
the pet-food industry has made some interesting observations

218
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,369
about the likes and dislikes of its four-legged clientele.

219
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:02,240
apparently, cats and dogs aren't crazy about food

220
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:06,110
that's too dry, too hard to chew, or too mushy.

221
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,247
if the pieces are too small, they'll swallow them whole

222
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,916
without chewing and not digest them properly.

223
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,585
but if the pieces are too big,

224
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,489
they'll gag and get turned off to the food altogether.

225
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,593
in the packaging department,

226
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,664
automated scales weigh the exact quantity per package.

227
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,768
this batch is destined for bags
weighing about 6 1/2 pounds.

228
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,881
the package sizes range from just under one pound

229
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,051
all the way up to 44 pounds.

230
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,356
shelf life is from 12 to 16 months,

231
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,258
depending on the formula.

232
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,570
pet-food experts say

233
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,974
dogs and cats prefer food with a fattier content

234
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,577
and a combined meat-and-cereal formula

235
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,580
over just cereal alone,

236
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,317
but too much meat flavoring can turn them off.

237
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,387
cats, as a rule, are more particular.

238
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,322
they favor more acidic food,

239
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,857
while dogs tend to have a sweeter tooth.

240
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,662
and you thought kids were fussy eaters.

241
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,073
narrator: no bathroom is complete without one.

242
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,941
and any parent will tell you

243
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,810
that no teenager can survive without one.

244
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:51,482
mirror, mirror on the wall, how do they make you, after all?

245
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,485
well, "how it's made" is about to show you.

246
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:58,589
but first, let's reflect on the history of mirrors.

247
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,966
the earliest mirrors were curved
pieces of highly polished metal,

248
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,935
such as brass or bronze.

249
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:14,038
they're even mentioned in the bible.

250
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,174
then, in the 14th century,

251
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,510
the venetians invented very crude glass mirrors

252
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,046
that reflected off a metallic backing.

253
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,515
they later perfected this technique

254
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,051
using an amalgam of tin and mercury.

255
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,187
eventually, the secret of mirror-making spread

256
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,722
to other cities.

257
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,792
by 1835, a german chemist developed

258
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,663
the silver-backed mirror that we know today.

259
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,807
a mirror starts out as clear glass.

260
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,878
a robot lays each panel horizontally on a conveyor belt,

261
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,082
which transports it to the washing station.

262
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,219
there, sprayers blast the glass
with water and cerium oxide,

263
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,222
a powder derived from a type of soil.

264
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,426
rotating brushes scrub and polish

265
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,695
both the top and bottom surfaces,

266
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,031
removing oils and other contaminants.

267
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,369
this washing process takes about a minute per panel.

268
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,105
next, sprayers rinse the glass

269
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,908
with piping-hot demineralized water,

270
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,178
demineralized because the minerals in plain tap water

271
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,380
would damage the metals they apply next.

272
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,784
the first metal is liquefied tin,

273
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,655
which goes on what will be the back of the mirror.

274
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:41,392
it allows the second metal, silver, to adhere

275
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,394
because silver won't stick directly to glass.

276
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,997
the silver is also in liquid form

277
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,667
mixed with a chemical activator.

278
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,204
within seconds of interacting with the tin, it hardens.

279
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,673
and as it does, you begin to see a reflection.

280
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,609
it's this silver backing

281
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:02,146
that transforms clear glass into a mirror.

282
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,748
sprayers rinse off the excess silver,

283
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,019
which gets recycled back into the system.

284
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:15,026
the factory will seal the silver
backing with two coats of paint.

285
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,560
paint by itself, however,

286
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,830
isn't enough to protect the silver in the long term.

287
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,501
so they first spray on a layer of copper.

288
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,378
sprayers rinse off the excess copper.

289
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,048
then the panel passes through a dryer

290
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,384
at almost 160 degrees fahrenheit.

291
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,054
this evaporates the moisture on the surface

292
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,423
in just 75 seconds.

293
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,327
now the panel passes, copper side up,

294
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,996
through what is called the curtain coater,

295
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:55,466
a machine that runs a continuous curtain of paint

296
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,534
across the conveyor belt.

297
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,737
with its fresh coat of paint,

298
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,907
the mirror then passes through an oven

299
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,741
heated to 210 degrees fahrenheit.

300
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:09,680
after a minute and 45 seconds, the paint is cured.

301
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,082
now the second coat of paint.

302
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,418
there's no reason for the different color

303
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,020
other than to differentiate the coats.

304
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,291
this time, the curing period is twice as long

305
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:25,763
and at a higher temperature, close to 245 degrees fahrenheit.

306
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,299
after an acid wash to remove any metal residues,

307
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:34,038
they stand the panel upright to inspect it.

308
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,441
if they find a fault, such as a bubble in the glass,

309
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,011
they cut that portion out.

310
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,516
the factory now cuts these large panels

311
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,387
into whatever size and shape the customer has ordered

312
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,523
using a special mirror-cutting machine

313
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,327
that's precision-guided by computer software.

314
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,201
it scores the mirror using a carbide wheel.

315
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,803
carbide is a strong metal.

316
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,540
to make round mirrors,

317
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,810
the machine first scores the panel into squares.

318
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,212
then, in each square, it scores a circle.

319
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,481
using special tools,

320
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,952
workers separate the squares, then the circles.

321
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,332
to make beveled mirrors,

322
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,068
they use what's called the shape-bevel machine.

323
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,807
first, it carves out the edge.

324
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:49,480
then polishes it to a shine using concentrated cerium oxide,

325
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,049
a stronger version of what they used earlier

326
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,853
to clean the glass surface before plating it with metals.

327
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,659
mirror factories also ship whole panels

328
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,528
