jimadores have grown and harvested the agave plant for

it takes seven years, on average, for a species called

00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:47,840
tool, the jimadores chop away the greenery until all that's

warm shade of amber. the master distiller personally  approves

goat skins. hitting the market in the  l 

50
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,133
pretty wavy and made some people seasick. but innovative changes in d 

51
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:17,109
make today's waterbeds as stable as a traditional mattress.   

52
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,647
displaces. that's why a waterbed mattress shapes to your body, giving  

53
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:26,718
equal support everywhere with no pressure points. a washable quilted cover sits 

54
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,590
top of the mattress to provide extra cushioning and absorb   

55
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:36,395
the mattress is made of high-durability vinyl.   i

00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:40,399
factory in giant rolls which workers feed into a conditioning    machi 

57
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:45,671
at a speed of one yard per minute, the machine heats the vinyl to 100 degrees  fah 

58
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:51,210
this preshrinks the material, ensuring the mattress won't   

59
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:56,014
next, computer-guided machines cut out the mattress's top and 

60
00:06:56,016 --> 00:07:04,422
die cutters stamp out the smaller and simpler corner and 

61
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:10,029
then, workers lay the top piece on a wooden pattern mold. applying this pattern makes  

62
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:17,569
vinyl more flexible, enabling the mattress to better follow  

63
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:27,112
the company won't reveal exactly how this caged device molds the pattern into 

64
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:32,985
now, with a die, workers cut a hole in the top piece for the  

65
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:38,590
after fitting the valve and cap to a piece of vinyl printed with product information, they lay 

66
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,461
the top piece, then fuse the vinyl with a high-frequency w 

67
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:47,532
it emits high-frequency electromagnetic waves that heat   and cause  

68
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:53,739
interact, blending the two pieces seamlessly into one.

00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:58,277
mattress. this is the most complex part of the process because it     

70
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:07,086
making a very particular angle. after fusing the folds with the high-frequency welder, they  

71
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:13,158
each corner onto a rounded form, then close off the tip by  w 

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:22,501
this makes a rounded corner, which is far more durable than a  pointed on 

73
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:28,106
whereas regular mattresses are foam-filled, waterbed mattresses  contain

bed waveless. mattresses come in various   

75
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:42,454
the more layers of fiber inside, the less the mattress moves. once they've inserted the f 

76
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:47,725
workers perform a final round of high-frequency welding to close    up the m 

77
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:53,198
first, they position an aluminum stick under the area they have 

78
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,602
a static laser line shows workers where to position the

they put the mattress in a press and, with a vacuum hose, extract  all the a 

83
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:30,569
then, they set the mattress aside for six hours to ensure  

84
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:37,643
would indicate a leak. elsewhere in the factory, they construct the frame in which  

85
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:42,714
mattress sits. the lower part is made of pvc plastic extruded into a    

86
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:47,186
shape. workers fuse the frame parts

the upper sides of the frame are made of upholstered foam, designed to be soft against  

93
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:27,359
back of your legs when you sit on the side of the bed. waterbed mattresses are

modeled after traditional japanese sandals that have a

y-shaped straps called uppers. the sole is constructed from the top and bott 

102
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,690
they make the bottom out of either heat-moldable plastic or rubber.

an injection-molding machine shoots the molten material into passing mold

111
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:26,611
for each color of the design. the screen is kind of like a  

112
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:31,883
shape of the design, and the rest of the mesh is blocked. workers load a pair of soles  

113
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:37,956
each station of a rotary-screen printing machine.  then, 

114
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,695
they close the first screen over the pair of soles, then, with

00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:09,854
now for the uppers. for this flip-flop style, they

once they've correctly positioned the ribbon, they

then, they connect the left-side and right-side straps with m

00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:30,609
add a toe piece... then stitch everything together. for aesthetics, they sew a c 

121
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:39,217
piece over the toe piece. uppers give flip-flops their

00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:19,591
trim the ends... then insert a last -- a foot form in the required shoe s

128
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:42,547
oven activates the adhesive. workers then place the bottom sole on a positioning guide  

129
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,952
stick the top sole onto it, locking the strap ends in    

130
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:52,424
this is instant-contact glue, so they have just one chance to get  the alignme

silver in its natural state isn't silver-colored at all.  

148
00:16:52,078 --> 00:17:00,418
those silver-looking deposits are actually zinc and lead.   

149
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,823
silver-rich areas the geologists pinpointed, then   

150
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:20,505
after the blast, carts hall the chunks of rock, called ore, to 

151
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:26,177
geologists then test ore piles and blend them as required to  

152
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:32,783
silver content per kilogram of ore.   the ore fi 

153
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:37,989
primary crusher. the machine's huge steel teeth 

154
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:41,926
smaller pieces. those pieces then drop through 

155
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:49,067
secondary crusher, which breaks them down into even smaller p 

156
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:59,944
those go into vibrating cone crushers, which pulverize them 

157
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:05,683
a conveyor transports the crushed ore to the ball mill.  

158
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:14,559
are roughly 2/10 of an inch big. as the mill's large cylinder  

159
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:20,966
around inside, grinding the ore into powder.   a wate 

160
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:26,371
flushes the silver-rich powder out of the cylinder and into large tanks which keep the w 

161
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:31,309
moving. to separate and dissolve the  

162
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:37,048
workers pour in acid. 72 hours later, the rock waste 

163
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,319
the solution containing dissolved silver is pumped t 

164
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:47,726
the filter plates are treated with a zinc-based chemical which   attracts  

165
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:53,064
as the solution passes through, the plates trap particles  c 

166
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:58,403
layer of black powder called silver precipitate. this precipitate is composed  

167
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:05,610
approximately 50% silver and 50% waste -- the waste being a jumble of various metals, d 

168
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:10,682
and other impurities. to separate the silver from the    waste, th 

169
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:15,620
precipitate in a gas furnace for a couple of hours.  in t 

170
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:20,158
technicians continuously test ore samples to determine the  

171
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,833
quantity of silver per kilogram of ore. they heat t 

172
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:34,706
degrees fahrenheit for about an hour to burn off the impurities. what's l 

173
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:41,513
are the silver and other metals, such as lead, zinc, copper, s 

174
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:46,184
lab technicians then treat the samples with a chemical that prevents silver from burning  

175
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:51,522
and put them back in the oven. when the samples come out, about  an hour la 

176
00:19:51,524 --> 00:20:00,732
metals have burnt off, and only silver is left.    they 

177
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:05,270
compare it to the weight of the original sample in order to   

178
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:10,742
the key to running a profitable mine is to ensure that the grade is consiste 

179
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:18,283
parameters. back at the mill, workers put the now dried silver  pre 

180
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:22,687
into an oven, along with chemicals which prevent silver 

181
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,955
approximately four hours later,             

182
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,558
the silver and waste have    

183
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,092
separated and melted.      

184
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,560
workers pour them into      

185
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,895
bar-shaped molds.        

186
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,630
the silver, being heavier,    

187
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,365
settles at the bottom.      

188
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,100
workers skim off the waste    

189
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,368
floating on top.         

190
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,571
in less than five minutes, the  

191
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,973
molten silver cools and hardens,            

192
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,175
enabling workers to extract what              

193
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,778
is now a silver bar.       

194
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,445
the mining company sells the   

195
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,048
bars to a refinery for      

196
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,783
processing into industrial-grade        

197
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,250
silver.
