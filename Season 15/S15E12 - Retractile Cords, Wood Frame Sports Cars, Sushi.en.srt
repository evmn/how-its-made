narrator: retractile cords        

4
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,322
were invented for telephone handsets in the late 1930s,  

5
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,590
and ever since, these coiled cords       

6
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,193
have been making a lot of great connections,  

7
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,862
from medical equipment to construction tools      

8
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,331
to industrial machinery.    

9
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,368
they keep in a lot of things plugged in, in a very neat way.

10
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:15,408
retractile cords stretch when needed          

11
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,944
and spring back into a tight coil afterwards, 

12
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,347
and that means no tangled knots
and wiring snarl-ups,     

13
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,681
which saves time        

14
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,686
that would otherwise be spent straightening things out.   

15
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,822
production begins with thermoplastic coloring.  

16
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,825
the color selected indicates the electrical function    

17
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,293
of each wire in the cord.   

18
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,162
it takes just a small amount  

19
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:39,432
to tint a batch of white plastic
pellets a vivid hue      

20
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,634
as they melt in an extruder.  

21
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,439
tin-plated copper wire feeds into that extruder,   

22
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,974
and the colored molten plastic coats the wire         

23
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,578
to provide an insulating wrap. 

24
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,181
as it exits the extruder,   

25
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,716
the plastic casing is still warm and soft,    

26
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,119
but cool water solidifies it. 

27
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:08,193
a spool then takes up the insulated wiring.     

28
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,931
next, several wires unwind simultaneously     

29
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,667
over guide rollers and into a spreader plate.   

30
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:20,606
the plate precisely aligns the wires as they feed into a die. 

31
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,275
this die draws them down to the correct diameter,    

32
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,877
while a mechanism       
further down the production line

33
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,980
twists the wires into one cord.

34
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:35,020
the cord continues to twist  

35
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,690
as rollers wrap polyester-backed
foil around it.        

36
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,891
this foil is a shield     

37
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,226
to protect the wires from electrical interference  

38
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,630
and is an optional feature.  

39
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:47,967
the cord then passes through the twisting mechanism 

40
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,669
and onto a take-up reel.    

41
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,638
next, standard unshielded cord 

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,375
travels through beads of electrodes      

43
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,378
as thousands of volts of    
electricity are applied to them.

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,315
the energized electrodes detect
any faults in the wires.    

45
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,652
if they find none, the cord moves forward.    

46
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,724
the next machine gives the cord
a paper wrap.         

47
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:16,195
that's followed by the final layer, a thermoplastic jacket. 

48
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,968
it also takes a trip through a cooling station to solidify. 

49
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,375
an ink-jet printer applies   
technical and other information.

50
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,012
the plastic casings of some cords         

51
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,748
have been treated with fire-retardant chemicals. 

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,151
now they put that treatment to the test.          

53
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,819
the cord doesn't catch fire,  

54
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,889
confirming that it's flame-resistant.   

55
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,025
so it's now ready to be coiled.

56
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,961
this worker gets the process started    

57
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,231
by manually winding it around a rod.         

58
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,102
then he presses a button,   

59
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:01,574
and the automated winder does the rest.         

60
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:06,178
this establishes the spiraling profile of the retractile cord.

61
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,181
but at this point, the coil won't hold.      

62
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,518
simply pulling out the rod would cause it to unravel.   

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,855
the plastic sheathing around the wires has no memory,

64
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,924
so it won't retain the shape. 

65
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,794
they wheel the cords, still on rods,         

66
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:26,198
into an industrial oven and bake
them at 200 degrees fahrenheit. 

67
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,741
this gives the cord's plastic casing the necessary memory  

68
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:40,479
so that when the operator pulls 
out the rod, the coil is intact.

69
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,352
but it still doesn't have the necessary snap.      

70
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,553
that is now achieved      

71
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,890
by reversing the direction of the coil.          

72
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:53,358
the equipment used for that is proprietary,        

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,229
so this worker demonstrates the basic concept with a drill.

74
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,765
the drill turns the cord counterclockwise        

75
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,300
for an impressive rewind.   

76
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,436
the effect ripples all the way down to the end.  

77
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,706
reversing the direction of the coil transforms it.   

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,708
the process tightens the spiral

79
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,044
so that after the cord is stretched,         

80
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,480
it retracts to its original shape.     

81
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,518
the difference is very apparent.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,988
the top coil in this shot hasn't been reversed,     

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,292
while the bottom one has, and it's clearly much tighter. 

84
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,663
so these retractile cords   

85
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,132
are now ready to be stretched to the max           

86
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,435
and snap right back again.   

87
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,288
narrator: being behind the wheel     

88
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,423
of a traditional-style british sports car       

89
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,226
will surely get you noticed.  

90
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:04,229
these vehicles combine modern 
performance with classic styling

91
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,099
that dates back        
to the turn of the last century.

92
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,567
even the inner construction is traditional,        

93
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,404
with the car's body frame handcrafted out of wood.    

94
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,242
the first models, in the early 1900s,      

95
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,845
were three-wheelers with motorcycle engines.    

96
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,114
it wasn't until the mid-1930s 

97
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,250
that these hip sports cars acquired a fourth wheel    

98
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,786
and a four-cylinder automotive engine.       

99
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,923
but one thing hasn't changed in more than a century --   

100
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,725
the wood-frame construction.  

101
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,926
in the factory's woodshop,   

102
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,530
workers glue together 2/10"-thick ash panels     

103
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,933
to produce a 3-ply lamination 

104
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:43,869
with which to make the frame's curved components. 

105
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,537
to make each wheel arch,    

106
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,473
they clamp a lamination into a rounded jig       

107
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,075
for a couple of hours.     

108
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,011
the glue dries, locking the curve in the wood. 

109
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,481
they make the frame's front section         

110
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,950
out of three solid pieces of ash.            

111
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,819
triangular wood jigs align the frame,        

112
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,623
while workers screw in a solid ash rail on each side. 

113
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,758
these rails connect to back framing        

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,361
and form the bottom of the car's door openings.  

115
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,097
two vertical rails form the side of the openings 

116
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,566
on which the door will hinge. 

117
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,835
using a spoke shave,      

118
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,705
workers fine-tune each doorframe
so that it fits perfectly   

119
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,840
into the openings they have just constructed.  

120
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,282
then they mount the doorframe with strong steel hinges.   

121
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:36,388
they submerge the finished frame
in wood preservative,     

122
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,390
giving the chemical plenty of time         

123
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,060
to thoroughly penetrate the pores of the wood.     

124
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:43,395
this will prevent the frame from rotting.         

125
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,868
in another part of the factory,

126
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,472
workers assemble the engine, transmission, and drive shaft 

127
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,141
to the car's galvanized-steel chassis,   

128
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,545
then mount the front and rear axles and wheels.       

129
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,347
they'll switch the brass wheel nuts      

130
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,616
for fancy chrome ones later on.

131
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,220
back to the bodywork now.   

132
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,890
they cut an aluminum panel to the shape of the doorframe, 

133
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,961
only wider all around, clamp it on to the doorframe, 

134
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,230
hammer down this door skin, as it's called,        

135
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,833
over the frame edge all around.

136
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,837
they remove the clamps,    

137
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,841
then peel off         
the panel's protective covering.

138
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,378
after paneling the rest of the wood frame in aluminum, 

139
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,416
they re-install the door, gently
tapping the hinge pin in place. 

140
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,454
now they lower the paneled body
onto the chassis.       

141
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,123
the only wooden parts not covered with metal     

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,791
are the rear wheel wells.   

143
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,261
unlike the rest of the body frame,       

144
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,330
these are made of water-resistant plywood.  

145
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,834
two bonnets form the car's hood.

146
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,269
to make each one,       

147
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:02,006
a craftsman feeds aluminum through rollers to curve it.  

148
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,276
then he massages it over an old log        

149
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,212
that this factory's been using for this purpose        

150
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,414
since the 1930s.        

151
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,819
they put each panel through a press that cuts louver holes.

152
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,154
in the old days,        

153
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:18,357
the purpose of louvers was to ventilate the engine,  

154
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,558
but now they're mostly for style.           

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,427
the two finished bonnet panels 

156
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,830
go on either side of a central hinge,      

157
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:28,000
forming a car hood       
that opens like butterfly wings.

158
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,906
the body gets a paint job.   

159
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:37,775
then they trim the car's interior with genuine leather, 

160
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,712
cutting and stitching every piece by hand      

161
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,781
and affixing it to the wood frame.       

162
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:47,319
they make door seals by wrapping
leather around rubber tubing. 

163
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,859
and finally they re-fit the wings,     

164
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,329
now painted, over the front and back wheels.

165
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,397
the front wings have shells  

166
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,567
which house the car's headlights.     

167
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,871
workers install the radiator at the front          

168
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,173
and top it with a cover called a cowl.         

169
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,345
then the electronic-dashboard instruments, gearshift,    

170
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,616
windshield, mirrors, and, of course, the steering wheel. 

171
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,752
they also attach the hood --  

172
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:25,891
handcrafted from either vinyl 
or mohair -- to a tubular frame.

173
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,627
after installing the leather-trimmed seats,   

174
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,363
they take the vehicle out for a test drive,       

175
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:32,731
then, upon return,       

176
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,100
put it through a meticulous inspection, inside and out.  

177
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,170
after a wax polishing,     

178
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,106
this fancy fusion of technology and tradition  

179
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,809
finally gets the green light. 

180
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,524
narrator: sushi is a meal that appeals  

181
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,258
to the discriminating palate. 

182
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,594
but it had very rudimentary beginnings.  

183
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,664
the first sushi was actually a form of food preservation.  

184
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,200
salted fish was covered in cooked rice   

185
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,202
and left to ferment for months and even years.        

186
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,540
the rice was then thrown away and the fish consumed.     

187
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,345
a fresh approach came about a century ago,      

188
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,215
when the japanese began combining raw fish    

189
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,484
with pressed mounds of cooked rice.        

190
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,819
it was a mouth-watering combination          

191
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,756
and brought something entirely new to the table.   

192
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,625
rice is now an essential part of sushi.  

193
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,361
sushi chefs use short or medium grain   

194
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,098
because it sticks together better than longer grain.    

195
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,701
the rice undergoes a thorough washing.      

196
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,637
first the chef swishes it around in water   

197
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,439
to rinse off impurities.    

198
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,242
this also begins to remove the rice bran,         

199
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,978
which has an undesirable flavor
and aroma.           

200
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,381
he drains the rice and adds clean water.     

201
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,385
next, he scrubs it with his palm
fairly vigorously       

202
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,588
to remove more of the rice bran.     

203
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,590
when the water becomes cloudy from the bran,         

204
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,858
he changes it again.      

205
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,528
by now, the water has softened the rice,     

206
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,930
which makes the grains prone to breakage.       

207
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,199
so he scrubs them more gently this time           

208
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,269
to keep the rice grains whole. 

209
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,538
finally, he rinses the rice under a running faucet     

210
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,941
until the water drains clear. 

211
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,144
this rice is now thoroughly washed and ready to cook,   

212
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,481
so he adds an equal amount of water and a splash of sake 

213
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,516
and plugs in the rice cooker. 

214
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,887
the previous day,       

215
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,758
he seasoned rice vinegar with a strip of dried kombu seaweed 

216
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,294
and left it to soak up the flavors.    

217
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:47,131
the flavored vinegar is key to making good sushi rice.   

218
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,067
it's what makes the rice sticky.

219
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,041
he pours the sushi vinegar into the cooked rice      

220
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,511
and evenly distributes it with a gentle folding motion  

221
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,314
to keep each grain intact.   

222
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:08,053
he fans the rice and grains dry,
to a nice sheen.        

223
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:12,257
with the rice prepared, it's time for all the raw details. 

224
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,993
each fish must be assessed for spoilage or damage.    

225
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,262
the chef lifts the gills    

226
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,398
to confirm that the flesh underneath   

227
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,201
is red and translucent -- essentially fresh-looking.   

228
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,206
he also examines the eyes of the fish.     

229
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,475
they should be bright and clear.

230
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,612
he then prods the skin of this sea bream fish     

231
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,347
to establish it's firm.    

232
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,616
once he's satisfied, he prepares the fish,     

233
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,619
first scraping away the unpalatable and messy scale

234
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,422
with a rasp.          

235
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,226
next, he uses the thin edge of a one-sided blade      

236
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,761
to fillet the fish.      

237
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,163
razor-sharp,          

238
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,166
this knife cuts cleanly through the fragile flesh.   

239
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,202
he slices off and discards the head.     

240
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,241
he then carves the flesh from the backbone.       

241
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,447
now, firmly grasping the tail of the fillet,    

242
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,515
he cuts the skin from the flesh,

243
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,384
using a zigzag motion to pull it away.        

244
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,854
this technique leaves no flesh on the skin at all       

245
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,457
so that not a morsel goes to waste.         

246
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:24,396
using fish-bone tweezers, he extracts all the little bones. 

247
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,868
he now slices the fish on an angle across the grain, 

248
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,336
using one long stroke     

249
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,408
that doesn't tear the fibers the way a sawing motion would. 

250
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,911
the result is a shiny, smooth piece of sea bream.   

251
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,547
next he peels away       

252
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,684
the transparent outer skin of a marinated mackerel    

253
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:49,054
to expose the silvery subskin. 

254
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,356
the gorgeous subskin      

255
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,625
is a feature that adds     
presentation value to the sushi,

256
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,728
and it's also tasty.      

257
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,639
next, he carves tuna      

258
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,109
that's been frozen within hours of being caught. 

259
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,111
this locks in freshness    

260
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,981
so that, when thawed, it's suitable for sushi.    

261
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,451
and the freezing also kills any parasites in the fish.   

262
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,391
he chops spring onions into thin rings.        

263
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,429
they'll be used to offset the strong taste of mackerel sushi.

264
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:36,400
he then mixes water and wasabi 
powder to create wasabi paste --

265
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,737
the pungent condiment that adds kick to sushi.    

266
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,808
and with all the ingredients prepared, 

267
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,644
it's time to start rolling, so stay tuned.         

268
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,562
narrator: once a simple food  
sold by japanese street vendors,

269
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,096
sushi has gone uptown.     

270
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,900
today, skilled chefs produce bite-sized morsels       

271
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,635
with gastronomic artistry.   

272
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,572
a blend of color, texture, and taste,      

273
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:17,108
sushi appeals to the eye as well as the palate.     

274
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,848
the chef moistens his hands  

275
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,051
to keep the rice from adhering to them as he works.      

276
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,586
he dabs wasabi         

277
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,655
and places a ball of rice on one of the tuna slices.   

278
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,992
he pokes a hole in the center of the ball to introduce air. 

279
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,194
this keeps the rice from compacting        

280
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,062
as he shapes the fish around it

281
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:41,166
to make a type of sushi called nigiri sushi.      

282
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:47,672
to form nigiri, the chef works swiftly     

283
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,408
to minimize the fish's exposure
to his touch.         

284
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,878
human body temperature is much higher than room temperature,  

285
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,480
and prolonged exposure to it  

286
00:16:55,482 --> 00:17:00,151
would compromise the fresh taste
of the sushi.         

287
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,221
a little pickled ginger to cleanse the palate,     

288
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,857
and this sushi is ready to serve.       

289
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,428
to make cucumber rolls -- or kappamaki --        

290
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,697
he carves the outer part of the cucumber        

291
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,500
into a long, wide ribbon, stopping at the soft core.   

292
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,705
he slices the ribbon in two and layers the pieces.     

293
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,442
he then chops the cucumber into uniformly thin sticks.  

294
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,312
this exposes more of the vegetable's fiber, 

295
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,115
to maximize the taste.     

296
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,918
this is roasted seaweed, called nori.          

297
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,054
he places it, shiny side down, on a bamboo rolling mat.    

298
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,456
he lightly presses rice into a ball          

299
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,827
so the grains stick together as he transfers it to the nori.

300
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,866
he spreads the rice evenly,  

301
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,735
leaving a margin of nori at the top.          

302
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,342
and now he's ready for those  
expertly sliced cucumber sticks.

303
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:01,479
he groups several in the center
of the bed of rice.      

304
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:06,618
then, gripping the mat on one side,          

305
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,554
he folds the nori around the fillings.      

306
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,489
as he squeezes the pack,    

307
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:16,427
some rice spills into the margin of nori at the top. 

308
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,430
but there's still enough space to create an overlap      

309
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,367
and seal the ends of the nori around the fillings.      

310
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,971
using a wet cloth, he tucks in the overflow at both ends.   

311
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,773
he slices the roll in half.  

312
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,041
he aligns the halves      

313
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,044
and slices three times to create six pieces,      

314
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,780
each piece approximately the same height,        

315
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,749
for an attractive lineup.   

316
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,721
next, he makes uramaki,    

317
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,591
a kind of sushi with rice on the outside,   

318
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,994
which is why they're also called
inside-out rolls.       

319
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,664
he spreads rice evenly over the nori         

320
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,199
and flips it around to the shiny side.       

321
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,934
he dips a finger in wasabi   

322
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:00,672
and spreads it on the nori at midpoint.          

323
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:04,876
he arranges tuna on the wasabi-coated section.   

324
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:09,014
the raw red fish is then paired
with slices of avocado     

325
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,783
for a tantalizing contrast.  

326
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,287
he folds the rice-coated nori over the fillings       

327
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,889
and tucks it around them.   

328
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:21,660
he continues rolling until he reaches the edge.   

329
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,231
he garnishes the rice with toasted sesame seeds   

330
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:30,435
for visual interest and tasty crunch.       

331
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,303
he covers the roll with plastic

332
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,172
to protect it from the grooves of the sushi mat        

333
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,609
as he shapes it into a tighter pack.      

334
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,047
he then removes the mat    

335
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:47,985
and carves the inside-out roll into bite-sized pieces.    

336
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:52,724
inside-out sushi was invented in the 20th century      

337
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:56,895
to appeal to westerners who preferred not to see the nori. 

338
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,672
the final thing on the menu is the hand roll,       

339
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:10,475
also known as temaki sushi.  

340
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:14,479
he presses soft rice into the crispy nori      

341
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,949
and layers the next ingredients
diagonally over the rice --  

342
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:22,687
wasabi, a japanese herb called shiso, and two pieces of tuna. 

343
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,760
he folds the nori around the fillings      

344
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:33,565
to contain them in a seaweed cone.       

345
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,634
now all that's left is the presentation,      

346
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:40,304
and when it comes to sushi, less is more.         

347
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,975
overgarnishing can detract   
from the main event -- the fish.

348
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,112
a simple, artful arrangement  

349
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,948
puts the focus on its raw appeal.       

350
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,194
