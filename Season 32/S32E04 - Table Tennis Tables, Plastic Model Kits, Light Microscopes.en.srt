00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,825
then, the box is wrapped in plastic,     

158
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,461
and the ends are sealed with heat guns.        

159
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,500
a year of planning has gone into
making the plastic mold kit.  

160
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,237
but took less than 10 minutes to mold the kit parts     

161
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,974
and package them.       

162
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,578
building the model will take 10 to 12 hours.      

163
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,447
the factory does a test build on each model         

164
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,651
to confirm that it comes together as planned.

assembling a plastic model kit 

169
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:03,201

decals mimic the i.d. information      

171

on the outside of the original aircraft.   

172

these decals have been pretreated with adhesive.   

173
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,619
soaking the decals in water activates them.        

174
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,090
the assembler brushes more water

175
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,959
onto the design spots on the model.         

176
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,964
and applies the decals to the dampened spots.     

177
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,101
as the glue dries, they adhere to each other.   

178
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:42,574
the plastic models can also be painted

observation is an important aspect of science.

the light microscope increases the power of observation,   

191
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,125
making it possible to see things

192

this 19th-century microscope represented a turning point,

with lenses that delivered more light to specimens,    

195
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,403
increasing resolution.     

196
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,273
a light microscope often has multiple lenses,      

197
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:53,345
all made from special optical glass.     

198
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,281
a drill with a core bit tunnels into the glass     

199
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,085
to produce several solid cylinders.        

200
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,421
the drill cuts them larger and thicker          

201
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,023
than the final specifications. 

202
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,060
this gives technicians extra material to work with.  

203
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,966
a tool moves the cylinder against a spinning blade    

204
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:16,835
slicing it into lens blanks.  

205
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,504
the cylinder is first glued to a glass block,       

206
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,573
then glued to the tool.    

207
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,943
this method holds the cylinder in the correct position.    

208
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,981
since bits of glue are left on the lenses,         

209
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,784
a thorough washing removes them.

210
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:39,391
next, a device grips the lens using vacuum pressure     

211
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,727
and angles it for grinding.  

212
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,867
multiple grinding tools remove any excess glass    

213
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,803
and shape the radius of the lens.

00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,675
in a process known as lapping, 

215
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,477
a technician applies a fine abrasive compound    

216
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,281
to a bowl with the desired contours.   

217
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,951
he rotates and rubs the lens against the bowl        

218
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,386
to further shape the lens.   

219
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,692
he rinses off the lens and holds it against a light  

220
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,094
while he examines it for scratches.         

221
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,234
he measures the radius of a master lens        

222
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:25,970
and compares it to that of the lens he's been working on. 

223
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,638
if the measurements are off,  

224
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,309
he'll remove more material.  

225
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,844
once additional material is removed,          

226
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,913
he measures the thickness of the lens   

227
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,449
and compares it to what it was before the adjustments.    

228
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,855
next, these polishing tools will be used          

229
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,192
to fine-tune the profile of the microscope lenses.   

230
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:53,064
to protect the lenses during polishing,       

231
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,001
a technician sprays on a temporary lacquer.      

232
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,671
these tools will remove    

233
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,407
just a fraction of a millimeter
of glass,           

234
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,410
but it will make an important impact.      

235
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,946
polishing liquid provides fine abrasion     

236
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,316
and enables the tool to move across the glass.   

237
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:18,557
then, a robot trims the edges of the lens.     

238
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,892
a device clamps the lens in place       

239
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,262
as trimming continues along the edges.        

240
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,401
trimming allows the lens to reach the correct diameter. 

241
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,704
next, the lenses are cleaned     

242
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,641
in multiple water-based solutions.     

243
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:40,244
in the baths, the vibrations from high-frequency sound   

244
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,114
create a gentle scrubbing action.       

245
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:47,718
the intensive cleaning leaves the lenses pristine.  

246
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,455
a technician places the freshly cleaned lenses   

247
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,858
in round trays.        

248
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,726
she handles them very carefully

249
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,463
inserting them individually into each tray slot.      

250
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,332
because they're extremely fragile,       

251
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:03,835
the slightest pressure could crack them.       

252
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,207
the lenses in the trays will receive          

253
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,076
an antireflective coating --  

254
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,113
one that will prevent a loss of light due to reflection.  

255
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,352
next, the antireflective material  

256
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,820
is loaded into a coating machine.

of magnesium fluoride into a receptacle in the base.

00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,699
she inserts a piece of aluminum oxide

evaporate the materials.

308
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,075
the larger part of the knob is for quick motorized focus. 

309

it's equipped with a mirror, prism lens,          

320
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,853
and a magnifying lens.     

321
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,922
it will reflect light to the lenses in the eyepiece

or external cameras.      

323
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,197
then the side port revolver is tested.           

324
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,802
at this point, multiple lenses have been installed

this part directs light through
the lens and onto the specimen,

then a technician installs the transmitted light arm.   

340
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,051
the light arm is used for magnifying transparent
