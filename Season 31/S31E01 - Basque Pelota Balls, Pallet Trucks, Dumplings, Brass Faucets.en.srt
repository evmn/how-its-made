      pelota is a ball game     
         that originated        

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,190
      in the basque region      
      of france and spain.      

9
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,592
    most versions are played    
         against a wall,        

10
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,396

 throws the ball either by hand,

      had a plumbing system     
consisting of terra-cotta pipes,

249
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,752
   providing water to faucets   
    made of gold and silver.    

250
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,325
      today's water faucets     
are typically made of cast brass

251
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,861
           plated with          
     another type of metal.     

252
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,765
  this single-handle faucet is  
most commonly seen in a bathroom

253
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,201
      and is chrome-plated.     

254
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,738
  this factory uses steel molds 
      to produce sand molds     

255
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,808
           for casting          
      the brass components.     

256
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,745
    the sand mold is actually   
 a sand model of the brass part,

257
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,947
     only slightly smaller.     

258
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,550
        workers file off        
        the excess sand,        

259
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,484
         which hardened         
       inside the channels      

260
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,622
     consuming the entirety     
    of the steel mold cavity.   

261
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,024
      in the casting area,      

262
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,095
     technicians load brass     
    ingots into the furnace,    

263
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,098
      which stands next to      
  an automated casting machine. 

264
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,769
        the furnace heats       
         the solid metal        

265
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,172
   at a temperature of nearly   
    2,000 degrees fahrenheit,   

266
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,441
   causing the metal to melt.   

267
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:27,979
 technicians place the sand mold
  inside a two-part steel mold. 

268
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,249
the inner cavity is in the shape
       of the faucet part,      

269
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,317
      only slightly larger.     

270
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,720
   the molten brass will flow   
          into the gap          

271
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:40,458
      between the sand mold     
   and the steel mold cavity.   

272
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,129
  the casting machine positions 
    the mold over the furnace   

273
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,398
and lowers the mold into a tube,

274
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,069
   which injects molten brass   
        into the cavity.        

275
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,606
        20 seconds later,       
      the steel mold opens,     

276
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,941
         and technicians        
      extract the castings      

277
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,010
   and set them aside to cool.  

278
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,616
    then the parts are placed   
  into a shotblasting machine,  

279
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,785
   which removes all the sand.  

280
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,823
     next, a worker saws off    
        the excess brass        

281
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:17,295

       of the steel mold.       

282
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:21,166
this separates two faucet bodies
    that were cast together.
