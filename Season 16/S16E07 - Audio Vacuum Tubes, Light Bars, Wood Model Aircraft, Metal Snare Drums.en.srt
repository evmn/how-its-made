        to sound quality,       

2
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,988
        audiophiles swear       
   by amplifiers which contain  

3
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,257
vacuum tubes to boost and modify
     the electrical signal.     

4
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,861
    they were the norm until    
     transistors came along     

5
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,795
          in the 1950s.         

6
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,398
  many audio enthusiasts still  
       prefer tube sound,       

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,870
 which they find warmer, richer,
        and more natural.

00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,205
    [ mid-tempo music plays ]   

9
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,415
    once standard in radios,    
  phonographs, and televisions, 

10
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,083
 today you see vacuum tubes only

11
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,352
        in very high-end        
        audio equipment.        

12
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:29,555
 they come in an array of models
  designed to perform specific  

13
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,557
     sound-enhancing tasks.     

14
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,162
    technicians at this czech   
     factory first wind wire    

15
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,298
 a precise number of revolutions

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,634
   with a very specific degree  
           of tension.          

17
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:47,373
 then they clean the surface and
 weld it to a support structure.

18
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:52,110
 this completes the grid, one of
   the tube's main components.  

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,781
     next, technicians take     
   the second main component,   

20
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,784
          the cathode,          
  and insert it into the grid.  

21
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,920
      when the sound signal     
        enters the tube,        

22
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,922
      the cathode produces      
      a flow of electrons.      

23
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,658
   the grid controls that flow  

24
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,061
   as it travels to the third   
   main component, the anode.   

25
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,197
     the anode's top secret     
          black coating         

26
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,865
     increases the effect of    
    the electrons hitting it,   

27
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,803
  causing the anode and cathode 
 to have two different voltages,

28
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,073
 both of which are greater than 
  that of the original signal.  

29
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,942
  this makes the signal larger  
       and more powerful,       

30
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,478
 meaning it amplifies the sound.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,749
 with those three components now
    assembled into one unit,    

32
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,952
the inside structure of the tube
          is complete.          

33
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:36,421
        now for the bulb,       
   which will encase the unit.  

34
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,423
a glass blower skillfully crafts

35
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,226
         it out of hard,        
     laboratory-grade glass.    

36
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,229
 using a high-temperature torch 
     and glass-making tools,    

37
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,567
      he melts the open end     
        and seals it off.       

38
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,569
  then he blows in a bit of air 

39
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:55,107
 to shape the end into an evenly
          rounded dome.         

40
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,578
   now he mounts the bulb on a  
 lathe to complete the shaping. 

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,781
keeping the glass evenly heated,

42
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,249
     he blows in just enough    
  air pressure to keep the bulb 

43
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,118
     from collapsing inward.    

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,721
     when the glass reaches     
   just the right temperature,  

45
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:13,259
    a die presses against it,   
    setting the final shape.    

46
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,396
 next, they mount a glass collar

47
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,866
    over copper wires clamped   
     into a motorized vice,     

48
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,471
then insert a glass straw called
       an evacuation port.      

49
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,140
 as the vise rotates, they heat 

50
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:31,543
      the collar uniformly      
    with stationary torches.    

51
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,145
     using a handheld torch,    

52
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:37,283
  they remove any stretches or  
  runs in the softening glass.  

53
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,819
     when the time is right,    
       they activate a die      

54
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,220
       to press the glass       
      into the final shape.     

55
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,156
this completes the stem on which

56
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,826
        the tube's inside       
         structure sits.        

57
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,161
      the wires protruding      
    from the top of the stem    

58
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:52,031
         connect to the         
     structure's terminals.     

59
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,170
now they put this assembled unit
         on a turntable         

60
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,339
  and center the bulb over it.  

61
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:11,049
 as the turntable revolves, they
  heat the bottom of the bulb.  

62
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,718
       as the glass melts,      
      they press it inward,     

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,287
     fusing it to the stem.     

64
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,867
  they remove the excess glass  
      and continue heating      

65
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,336
      to ensure the bottom      
        is fully sealed.        

66
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,674
       next, they prepare       
     to suction out the air.    

67
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,610
      this step is critical     
   to the tube's performance,   

68
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,014
      because air molecules     
  hinder the flow of electrons. 

69
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,616
   technicians fuse the tube's  
         evacuation port        

70
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,820
  to the glass evacuation line  
        of a vacuum pump.       

71
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:51,156
 the pump then extracts the air 
        through the port.       

72
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,493
   at the same time, they heat  
  the tube in a pull-down oven. 

73
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,962
 this increases pressure inside 
            the tube,           

74
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,031
   creating a stronger vacuum.  

75
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,035
   next, they run an inductive  
      heater over the tube.     

76
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,371
     this dislodges damaging    
           impurities,          

77
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,440
    enabling the vacuum pump    
        to draw them out.       

78
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,710
    they target the stem area   
 with a second inductive heater 

79
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:15,247
  to draw particles called ions 
   onto the glass permanently   

80
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,450
    so that they can't later    
        damage the tube.        

81
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,453
      finally, they connect     
      the protruding wires      

82
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,856
   to a plastic plug-in base.   

83
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,525
   there are subtle technical   
   differences between tubes    

84
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,993
       of the same model.       

85
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,062
 so the factory tests each tube,

86
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:34,133
 then matches pairs with similar
      performance features.     

87
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:37,403
  this ensures they'll amplify  
          sound evenly.

00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,691
         of a police car        
      or emergency vehicle.     

90
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,694
         the lights are

00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,363
     far more efficient and     
    durable than incandescent   

92
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,633
     or quartz halogen bulbs    
        or strobe tubes.        

93
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,034
 the mounting system is designed

94
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,370
     to withstand emergency     
       high-speed driving.

         [ siren wails ]        

96
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,844
the l.e.d.s are grouped by color
        within a module.        

97
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,446
     modules can be arranged    
      in any configuration      

98
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,115
     on the light-bar base.     

99
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,250
         the base mounts        
      to the vehicle's roof     

100
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,520
       via straps made of       
 high-strength stainless steel. 

101
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,723
       those straps begin       
         as flat pieces,

        a starting shape.       

103
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,729
  a 50-ton forming press bends  
    them to the final shape,    

104
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:43,168
  which fits the exact contour  
   of the vehicle's doorjamb.   

105
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,672
  the light bar's white light   
  modules fasten onto the base

   with the aluminum brackets   
   this worker is assembling.   

107
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,677

     out the heat the lights    
            generate.           

109

  this is critical, because if  
l.e.d.s overheat, they burn out.

        the base is made        
      of extruded aluminum.     

111

 this computer-controlled laser,
 working on six bases at a time,

112
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,627
   cuts out holes for venting   
           and cables.          

113
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,298
 the light bar has two cables --

114
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,233
        one running power       
   from the vehicle's battery   

115
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,169
        to the light bar        
     and another connecting     

116

117
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,506
       to the light bar's       
    electronic control board.   

118
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,777
  an automatic machine measures 
  and cuts the required length  

119
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,846
 of each cable, then strips off 
        a specific amount       

120
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:31,316
     of the pvc outer jacket    
          at both ends.         

121
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,585
    this exposes three wires,   

122
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:38,657
   two of which are insulated   
     and inside a foil wrap.    

123
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,993
  after stripping off the foil, 

124
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:44,396
 an automatic stripping machine 
    removes some insulation,    

125
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:49,268
     bearing the tin-coated     
       copper wire within.      

126
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,004
      workers put contacts      
   onto two of those wires --   

127
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,808
   the ground and the power --  

128
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,010
     then press the contacts    
           on securely          

129
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,679
     with a crimping device.    

130
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,216
  next, they connect a terminal 
       to the third wire,       

131
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,818
        the shield drain.       

132
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,353
  this wire reduces electronic  
          interference          

133
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,823
        from sources like       
        the police radio.       

134
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,025
       now for the l.e.d.       
         light modules,         

135
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,894
      the main component of     
      which is a reflector.     

136
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,364
they put the reflector's plastic
  body into the sealed chamber  

137
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,032
    of a metalizing machine.    

138
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,902
    the machine then releases   
            argon gas           

139
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,105
   while applying hundreds of   
      volts of electricity      

140
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,440
  to a solid piece of aluminum. 

141
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,243
    this vaporizes the metal    
      into tiny particles,      

142
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,779
      which a vacuum draws      
      onto the plastic body     

143
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:37,316
   in an ultra-thin reflective  
            coating.            

144
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,185
 to broaden the horizontal range
       of the reflection,       

145
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,990
 workers install a device called
          a collimator.         

146
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,592
 then they take an l.e.d. light,

147
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,396
    put an electric insulator   
      on the back of it...      

148
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,934
  and mount it inside a housing 
  that's specifically designed  

149
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,603
to remove heat from the l.e.d.s.

150
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,072
     then they install these    
   assembled light components   

151
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,275
       in the reflector...      

152
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,412
install the connector that plugs
      into the wire harness     

153
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,547
           that leads           
     to the control board...    

154
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,685
...and test the finished module.

155
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,899
   to assemble the light bar,   

156
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,901
  they slide the control board  
         onto the base,         

157
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:32,104
    plug in the control cable   
     that connects the board    

158
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,038
   to the dashboard switches,   

159
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,774
     install the power cable    
            that runs           

160
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,110
   from the vehicle's battery   
        to the light bar,       

161
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:41,180
    and the wiring connecting   
    the lights to the board.    

162
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,319
 after mounting the white light 
     modules on the brackets    

163
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,521
 and securing them to the base, 

164
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,790
    workers take the colored    
         l.e.d. modules         

165
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,760
       and slide them onto      
     the tracks on the base.    

166
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,533
     they make the internal     
           connections          

167
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,535
      to the control board,     

168
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,270
   then plug each module into   
  the control board harnesses.  

169
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,407
   after testing to make sure   
   everything works properly,   

170
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,876
 it's just a matter of encasing 
          the modules,          

171
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,078
 starting with an aluminum top, 

172
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,948
    then slide on transparent   
         plastic lenses         

173
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,417
 with divider gaskets in between

174
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,954
to prevent rain from penetrating
   and shorting out the light.  

175
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,958
    a cap closes up each end.   

176
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,032
 after a final round of testing,

177
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:39,104
  the light bar is ready to hit 
     the roof and the road.     

178
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,325
  narrator: flying a wood model 
 aircraft is a way to experience

179
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,128
     the adventure of flight    
        on a small scale.       

180
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,731
     but there's a lot to do    
         before takeoff.        

181
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,267
     these miniature planes     
      usually come in kits      

182
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,069
  that can take dozens of hours 
       to piece together.       

183
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,805
but, of course, that's just part
           of the fun.          

184
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,346
   wood model planes are part   
      of aviation history.      

185
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,349
 the first real flying machines 
       were made of wood,       

186
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,218
            and soon            
     after their invention,     

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,622
 people began building miniature
   wood replicas in kit form.   

188
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,559
   today modern manufacturing   
   techniques take the concept  

189
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,095
      to a whole new level.     

190
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,566
production begins with blocks of
  wood that circle on a system  

191
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,901
          of conveyors.         

192
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:48,607
 each time around, a long blade 
    slices away a thin piece.   

193
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,846
they transfer the sheets of wood
           to a table           

194
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,316
         that moves in a        
 computer-choreographed sequence

195
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,918
while lasers overhead make cuts.

196
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,393
    this computerized system    
         produces parts         

197
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,861
          that will fit         
       together perfectly,      

198
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,364
            no matter           
    how intricate the design.   

199
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,135
  to assemble the kit at home,  

200
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,405
      the modeler extracts      
        the precut parts.       

201
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,409
   he then builds the fuselage  
    right on top of the plans   

202
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,013
     in order to follow them    
         to the letter.         

203
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,548
       after the fuselage       
       has been assembled,      

204
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,350
    he focuses on the wings.    

205
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,620
     he braces the main spar    
       with numerous ribs       

206
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,822
           to create a          
    cross-sectional air foil    

207
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,626
    that will generate lift.    

208
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:45,230
he then glues the wings' leading
     edge to the framework.     

209
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:49,634
the framework is very similar to
that of full-sized wooden wings 

210
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,837
     built in the early days    
           of flight.           

211
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,306
        it's made mainly        
       of tropical balsa,       

212
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:57,843
 a wood that's both lightweight 
    and exceptionally strong.   

213
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,448
the modeler joins the two wings.

214
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,385
 the tongue of one fits into the
   laser-cut slot of another.   

215
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,388
 this joint will later be glued 
        to reinforce it.        

216
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,394
  he demonstrates the next step 
using the wing of another model.

217
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:18,063
     he drapes plastic film     
    over the wing's skeleton.   

218
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,998
   he tacks the plastic to it   

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,068
    and smoothes out ripples    
          and bubbles.          

220
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,403
he then heat-shrinks the plastic

221
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,139
   to give the model aircraft   
         its tight skin.        

222
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,475
   of course, there's no need   
         for a paint job        

223
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,478
 because the plastic is tinted. 

224
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,682
      finally, he confirms      
      that it's drum tight.     

225
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,818
  back on the production line,  

226
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,754
    they're now winding wire    
      to produce a spring.      

227
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,489
 this spring is a shock absorber

228
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,426
         for the plane's        
       front landing gear.      

229
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,227
       with that complete,      

230
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,763
    they now position a sheet   
      of preheated plastic      

231
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,634
        above six molds         
        of wheel covers.        

232
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,240
he activates a vacuum that pulls
   the plastic over the molds.  

233
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,643
    in seconds, it cools and    
    solidifies into the shape   

234
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,180
      of the wheel covers,      
          called pants.         

235
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,787
 with the wheel pants assembled 
          to the craft,         

236
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,256
    the modeler now installs    
         the two-stroked        

237
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,259
     alcohol-burning engine     
    in the front compartment.   

238
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:29,935
     he attaches the muffler    
   to the engine's crank case.  

239
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:33,605
  he then secures the spinner's 
    back plate and propeller    

240
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:38,210
  onto the engine's driveshaft  
     with a washer and bolt.    

241
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,146
   this assembly will have to   
       withstand the force      

242
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,716
   of the spinning propeller,   
  so he tightens it to the max. 

243
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:58,329
   and this model plane is now  
        ready for flight.       

244
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:03,034
   incredibly, it started out   
  as a bunch of parts in a box, 

245
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,503
   but they all come together   

246
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,571
         in the hands of        
       a skillful modeler.      

247
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,841
    of course, a good set of    
   instructions is essential.   

248
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,378
      assembling each model     
    can take up to 50 hours.    

249
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,381
we've just shown the highlights.

250
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,454
        the payoff comes        
        when the operator       

251
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,724
         manipulates the

  the sky really is the limit.  

257

    narrator: the sound of a    
  snare drum is unmistakable -- 

258
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,096
       a sharp rattle with      
   a somewhat tinny resonance.  

259
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,365
       what produces this       
       distinctive sound?       

260
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,835
  it's a vibrating set of wires 
      called the snare wire     

261
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,104
   stretched across the bottom  
          of the drum.          

262
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,308
  the snare drum is the center  
        of the drum kit.

      [ drum music plays ]      

264
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:23,915
     the circular frame of a    
  snare drum, called the shell, 

265
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,183
   can be made of either wood   
            or metal.           

266
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,454
  metal shells produce a sharp, 
 loud, and more brilliant sound.

267
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,657
      the metal this german     
        drum company uses       

268
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,259
    is known as bell bronze,    

269
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:38,864
     which is approximately     
     78% copper and 22% tin.    

270
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,401
   workers first glue together  
       a three-part mold.       

271
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,737
      it's made of a sand       
      and chemical mixture      

272
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,273
   because sand can withstand   
         the temperature        

273
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,808
    of the hot molten metal.    

274
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,079
   the glue sets in about half  
 an hour, and the mold is ready.

275
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,480
         they steady it         
    with heavy steel plates,    

276
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,950
    then scoop a bucket full    
         of bell bronze         

277
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,287
        from the furnace        
        and pour it in.         

278
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:06,758
      it took four hours at     
    2,300 degrees fahrenheit    

279
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,693
       to melt the metal,       

280
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,629
     but just a few seconds     
       for it to solidify       

281
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:14,833
     inside the mold cavity.    

282
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:20,838
    they let the casting cool   
     for a couple of hours,     

283
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,409
    then break the sand mold    
         to extract it.         

284
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:30,315
  they clean off the loose sand 
       with a wire brush,       

285
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,784
      then ship the shell       
      to the drum factory,      

286
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:36,120
  where its first stop is onto  
       an automated lathe.      

287
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:40,325
  as the lathe spins, a cutter  
skims off a thin layer of metal,

288
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,728
   making the shell's exterior  
    surface clean and smooth.   

289
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,735
next, a computer-guided drilling
     machine bores 47 holes     

290
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,203
     for various components,    

291
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,406
  including fittings that hold  
           and adjust           

292
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,273
 the drum heads and a vent hole 

293
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,409
         that increases         
       the drum's volume.       

294
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,013
  then the machine changes the  
drilling tool for a milling tool

295
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,617
  and makes two recessed areas  
        called snare beds       

296
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,419
   in the shell's bottom edge.  

297
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,154
   the drill left rough edges,  

298
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,956
    so they clean and smooth    
            the holes           

299
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,759
   with a small grinding tool.  

300
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,363
     then they manually sand    
         the snare beds.        

301
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,369
   next, they sand the shell's  
        outside surface,        

302
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,638
       first with a rough       
         abrasive belt,         

303
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,574
      then with a fine one.     

304
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,644
   this leaves the metal shiny  
        and silky smooth.       

305
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,115
now they sand the inside surface
            by hand.            

306
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,124
     then they spray it with    
     bronze-colored lacquer     

307
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,394
 to give the metal an even color
     and prevent tarnishing.    

308
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,263
    they taped over the holes   
   to keep the colored lacquer  

309
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,865
    from hitting the outside    
            surface.            

310
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,135
    now they remove the tape    
      and spray the outside     

311
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,337
    with transparent lacquer,   

312
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,941
 which allows the natural color 
 of the metal to show through.

  25 minutes in an oven hardens 

314
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:09,147
        the lacquer into        
     a super durable finish.    

315
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,951
   then final assembly begins,  
 starting with the tension lugs,

316
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,154
     the fittings that hold     
     and adjust the tension

       of the drum heads.       

318
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,227
 next comes the action strainer,

319
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,628
 the mechanism the drummer flips
           up or down           

320
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,565
   to activate and deactivate   
        the snare sound.        

321
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:35,439
  the top drum head is made of  
  a strong polyester material.  

322
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:39,443
 a chrome-plated metal hoop will
   hold the head to the shell.  

323
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,913
  to tune the drum to a higher  
         or lower pitch,        

324
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,381
 the drummer tightens or loosens
           the screws           

325
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,185
to increase or decrease tension.

327
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,062
   the bottom drumhead is made  
    of clear polyester film.    

328
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,331
        it's much thinner       
      than the top drumhead     

329
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,868
    to enable the snare wire    
       to respond faster.       

330
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,470
   that snare wire is made of   

331
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:10,074
  multiple strands of stainless 
  steel, brass, or copper wire. 

332
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,143

        the bottom head,        

333
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,812
         laying each end        
         on a snare bed.        

334
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:18,349
 they attach the ends with nylon
  cords to the action strainer

   the drummer simply pulls up
