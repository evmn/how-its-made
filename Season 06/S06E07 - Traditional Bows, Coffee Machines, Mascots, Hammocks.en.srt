00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,492
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,260
       traditional bows...      

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,932
      ...coffee machines...     

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,471
          ...mascots...         

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,177
        ...and hammocks.        

8
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,454
  when some innovative caveman  
   invented the bow and arrow,  

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,456
   it was a huge breakthrough.  

10
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,193
      the discovery turned      
         the homo sapien        

11
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,661
        into an efficient       
        hunter-gatherer.        

12
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,532
           these days,          
   archery has made a comeback  

13
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,866
    in the hunting community,   

14
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,570
 and it's even been reclassified
      as an olympic sport.      

15
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,345
 today's bows are definitely not
       primitive devices.       

16
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,481
             crafted            
   with calculated precision,   

17
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,350
       they make it easier      
 for you to take your best shot 

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,220
  and hit your intended target. 

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:32,024
 to make a longbow, a craftsman 
 cuts six strips of cherry wood 

20
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:36,161
 just under a quarter of an inch
        using a band saw.       

21
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,562
    then, with a belt sander,   

22
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,632
       he repeatedly thins      
 the wood strips on both sides, 

23
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,634
   tapering the ends a little   
           each time.           

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,037
   the tapering gives the wood  
        some flexibility,       

25
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,974
     which the bow will need    
 to launch arrows into the air. 

26
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,442
       with this band saw,      

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,913
     he now carves a handle     
      from a piece of wood.     

28
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,183
  next he brushes superadhesive 
   glue onto fiberglass strips  

29
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,519
     and the tapered strips     
         of cherry wood.        

30
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,986
        he works swiftly        

31
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,591
   because the glue will start  
  to dry in less than an hour.  

32
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,195
    now he layers the strips.   

33
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,131
 the fiberglass strips buttress 
    the six glued wood strips   

34
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,533
         on either end.         

35
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,903
          this process          
      is called lamination.     

36
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,142
  next he glues the wood handle 

37
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,112
        to the fiberglass       
      and wood lamination.      

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,550
         and he tops it         
  with a piece of masking tape  

39
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,287
          to protect it         
 from scratches and glue smudges

40
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,622
     during the next steps.     

41
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,758
        now the laminates       
     are squeezed together.     

42
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:44,296
   he places them on a carved   
plywood shape called a bow form.

43
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,998
he positions a steel heat strip,
         a rubber hose,         

44
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,835
    and another plywood form    
    on top of the laminates.    

45
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,372
   he clamps it all together,   

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,975
  then inflates the rubber hose 
     with an air compressor.    

47
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,510
   the pressure from the hose   

48
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,179
     combined with the heat     
      from the metal strip      

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,451
 mold the wood to the bow shape 
        as the glue sets.       

50
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,987
         one hour later,        
    he removes the laminates,   

51
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,625
    nicely pressed and glued    
   into more bow-like curves.   

52
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,999
 now he draws the bow form onto 
  the newly curved lamination,  

53
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,536
      following a template      
       made of fiberglass.      

54
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,737
       with his band saw,       

55
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,675
        he cuts the wood        
along the lines he's just drawn.

56
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,546
     he cuts an arrow shelf.    

57
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,283
 that's the notch for the arrow 
   to rest as the archer aims.  

58
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,817
    then he trims the handle,   

59
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,988
    making it a little wider    
   at the center for comfort.   

60
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,227
              next,             
  using a coarse-toothed file,  

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,962
  he hollows out little grooves 

62
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,899
  in the upper and lower limbs  
           of the bow.          

63
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,568
   they're called string nocks  

64
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:00,438
         and the string         
     will loop around them.     

65
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,973
     to strengthen the tips,    

66
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,642
     he glues little pieces     
  of fiberglass and moose horn  

67
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,711
            over them           
  and the freshly filed nocks.  

68
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,448
   he clamps it in a vise grip  
             to set.            

69
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,652
     when it's dry, he files    
 through the horn and fiberglass

70
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,788
 to bring back the nock groove. 

71
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,258
 he smoothes it with sandpaper. 

72
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,661
      now he glues another      
  piece of wood over the handle 

73
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,330
           to improve           
    the look and feel of it.    

74
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,799
      he clamps it together     
      while the glue dries,     

75
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:32,404
     and three hours later,     
          he sands it.          

76
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,006
    next he wraps the handle    
      in a piece of leather     

77
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,342
    and stitches it together    
        with nylon thread       

78
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,344
    called artificial sinew.    

79
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,081
  many years ago, they used the 
tendons of an animal for thread.

80
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,152
      the leather will make     
     the bow easier to grip.    

81
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,754
         with a gel pen,        
    he writes a serial number   

82
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,824
     on the back of the bow,    
   along with the draw weight.  

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,094
    this bow will hold about    
 44 pounds of pressure in check 

84
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,496
        when it's drawn.        

85
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,901
 this is a flemish string jig --
a wood fixture with posts on it.

86
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,904
      he loops nylon string     
        around the posts.       

87
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,772
     this is how he measures    
           the string.          

88
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,176
 it's always four inches shorter
          than the bow.         

89
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,378
he cuts it with a utility knife,

90
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,648
     then rolls wax onto it     
 to make it easier to work with.

91
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,786
    he measures some string.    

92
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,455
         then he twists         
     16 strands of nylon --     

93
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:28,427
   8 black and 8 white -- into  
 a braid with loops on the ends.

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,600
he hooks the string on the nocks

95
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,002
          and it's time         
      for target practice.      

96
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:41,339
      as he bends the bow,      
        energy is stored.       

97
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,210
 he releases it, and the energy 
 propels the pointed projectile 

98
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,146
        right on target.        

99
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,025
     narrator: coin-operated    
  coffee machines are a staple  

100
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,427
  in offices and public places. 

101
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,629
           years ago,           
these machines just weren't able

102
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,964
  to produce consistent brews.  

103
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,834
   and there also wasn't much   
    choice in brewing style.    

104
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,903
  but today, even finicky java  
  junkies drink machine coffee  

105
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,572
   because the latest machines  
      have mastered the art     

106
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,642
   of making delicious coffee   
       one cup at a time.       

107
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,781
   this office coffee machine   

108
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,883
actually makes several different
     types of hot beverages.    

109
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,852
  and if your employer prepays, 

110
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,721
    you don't have to insert    
           any coins.           

111
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,323
        production begins       
      with a sheet of steel     

112
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,060
      about 6 1/2 feet long     
    by about 1 1/2 feet wide.   

113
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,395
   this flat, as it's called,   
       will become the top      

114
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,397
        and side sections       
    of the machine's casing.    

115
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,399
  a computer-guided punch press 

116
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,668
  makes dozens of perforations  
         for ventilation        

117
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,136
  and for the various fittings  

118
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,672
      the machine will need     
      in order to function.     

119
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,545
   a worker puts another sheet  
     of steel into a press.     

120
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,348
   this press bends the metal   
     into 90-degree angles.     

121
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,986
     this piece will become     
    the bottom of the casing.   

122
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,690
          a worker uses         
     a spot-welding machine     

123
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,092
    to assemble what's called   
         the base panel.        

124
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,961
      this will later house     
         a waste chute,         

125
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,531
  overflow sensors, and wires.  

126
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,567
 another worker coats the casing

127
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,304
       with an epoxy-based      
          paint powder.         

128
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,640
          this process          
  statically charges the powder 

129
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,708
    and draws it to the metal   
         like a magnet.         

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,979
          excess powder         
   falls into a barrel below.   

131
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,314
  here a worker installs a fan  
         that will vent         

132
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,918
       the steam and heat       
  generated inside the machine. 

133
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,320
    another worker assembles    

134
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,322
         one of the two         
   coffee-delivery mechanisms,  

135
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,790
         called augers.         

136
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,260
when the machine's on, they move
the ground coffee to the brewer.

137
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:47,798
   he installs the augers into  
 what's called the dual hopper. 

138
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,200
    the hopper's two sections   

139
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,802
   will hold up to six pounds   
   of different coffee blends,  

140
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,673
 such as dark and light roasts. 

141
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,542
 next he installs what's called 
       an agitation wheel.      

142
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,411
  this plastic wheel helps move 
     the ground coffee along    

143
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,481
         and prevents it        
       from getting stuck.      

144
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:07,085
 the worker then aligns plastic 
     couplings on the augers    

145
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,220
             to mate            
 with the ingredient dispenser. 

146
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,023
    the dual hopper attaches    
   to the ingredient dispenser  

147
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,759
         with one screw         
     in a pivoting bracket.     

148
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,362
workers also connect power wires
    to the dispenser's motor    

149
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,765
   and to a water-inlet valve.  

150
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,635
        next they install       
 a heater and temperature sensor

151
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:27,038
   inside a plastic water tank  
that's nearly two gallons large.

152
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:31,042
this 1,100-watt heater keeps the
water at 200 degrees fahrenheit,

153
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,377
       just below boiling.      

154
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,245
 that's the optimal temperature 

155
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,048
      for extracting flavor     
    from ground coffee beans.   

156
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,984
     after applying stickers    
   warning service technicians  

157
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,587
     to turn off the machine    
       before draining it,      

158
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,390
        a worker installs       
     three outlet valves --     

159
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,792
         one to dispense        
       hot water for tea,       

160
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,996
         one for coffee,        
 and another for hot chocolate. 

161
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,864
 next come stainless-steel rods 

162
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,800
           to monitor           
the water level inside the tank.

163
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,337
          they trigger          
 an automatic refill mechanism. 

164
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,280
 the worker connects power wires
      to the brewer motor.      

165
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,349
  then she mounts what's called 
    the whipper mixing bowl.    

166
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,018
        this aligns with        
  the chocolate-syrup dispenser 

167
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,254
  to prepare the hot chocolate. 

168
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,027
        next she installs       
    the brewer-motor assembly   

169
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,630
   into the machine's casing.   

170
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,967
  this is the coffee machine's  
   15-button selection panel.   

171
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,036
       it lets you select       
 what type of hot drink to brew,

172
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,040
        in what cup size,       
       and when to start.       

173
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,709
            the panel           
    also displays the prices    

174
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,945
        when the coffee's       
        not on the house.       

175
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,649
     once that's hooked up,     

176
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,318
workers test the chocolate-syrup
        delivery system.        

177
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,655
    they run water through it   
   to ensure it doesn't leak.   

178
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,990
      they also test to see     

179
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,659
     if the system dispenses    
   the correct dose of syrup.   

180
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,528
   one dose is a half ounce --  
          a tablespoon.         

181
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:01,532
  a small cup of hot chocolate  
       requires two doses.      

182
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,136
   a large cup requires four.   

183
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,005
  now they install the brewer.  

184
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,141
       it works much like       
  a french press coffee maker,  

185
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,744
    brewing a separate batch    
          for each cup.         

186
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,613
           to test it,          
    they run water through it   

187
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,082
   and make sure the selection  
      panel works properly.     

188
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:20,085
      by testing the panel      
 with the coffee machine closed,

189
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,954
    they ensure the circuits    
      are properly aligned      

190
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,956
  behind the selection buttons. 

191
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,760
     depending on how strong    
     you select your coffee,    

192
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,163
      a dispenser releases      
    between .2 and .6 ounces    

193
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,433
        of ground coffee        
 into a re-usable nylon filter. 

194
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,036
 a piston then forces hot water 
       through the filter       

195
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:41,639
 for 10 to 20 seconds, depending
     on the size of the cup.    

196
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,643
      this process extracts     
 the flavor of the ground beans.

197
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,847
  the machine then scrapes away 
        the coffee grinds       

198
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,849
      and throws them down      
    the built-in waste chute.   

199
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,119
        then it prepares        
     for the next customer,     

200
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,755
   and the next delicious cup.  

201
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,064
        narrator: mascots       
   are supposed to bring luck,  

202
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,199
         but the people         
    who wear mascot costumes    

203
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,002
   have had a few lucky breaks  
   themselves in recent years.  

204
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,804
           the outfits          
      are much lighter now,     

205
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,805
        and there's even        
        an exhaust system       

206
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,941
    complete with a tiny fan    
         inside the head        

207
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,476
  so it's not so hot in there.  

208
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,447
 that helps the mascot keep his 
 energy up for the entire game. 

209
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,621
      this dinosaur mascot      
    for the lung association    

210
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,690
     is part of a new breed.    

211
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,492
       it's really evolved      
         into something         

212
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,028
     that's relatively easy     
           to work in.          

213
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,632
     to make this dinosaur,     
      they sketch him out.      

214
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,969
  then the artist modifies the  
  figure to human proportions,  

215
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,305
  targeting a height of 5'10",  

216
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:52,977
  which means the costume would 
 fit performers 5'8" to 6' tall.

217
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,915
  the artist designs huge eyes  
  and a very extravagant mouth, 

218
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,850
          and not just          
      for creative reasons.     

219
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,920
  the large openings will give  
    the mascot performer room   

220
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,056
      to see and to breathe     
        through screens.        

221
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,927
now a sculptor carves big pieces

222
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,795
         of lightweight,        
        uncrushable foam.       

223
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,998
      with a utility knife,     
 he shapes the dinosaur's head, 

224
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,601
  based on the design pattern.  

225
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,804
    traditionally, fiberglass   
 has been used for mascot heads 

226
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,874
  but foam is half the weight.  

227
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,610
   he attaches a battery pack   
   to the inside of the head,   

228
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,680
    at the back of the neck,    
          using velcro.         

229
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,948
    he tests it to make sure    
       it has enough juice      

230
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,218
       to power this tiny,      
       square exhaust fan,      

231
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,287
      which is to be placed     
   inside the head at the top.  

232
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,758
then he sprays glue on the foam,

233
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,562
  sticking the sculpted layers  
        of foam together.       

234
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,799
      now the dinosaur head     
    is starting to shape up.    

235
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,237
           he cuts out          
    those enormous eye holes.   

236
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,040
    then he tries on the head   
            for size.           

237
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:01,178
      he checks visibility      
      and ease of movement.     

238
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,915
    next the sculptor slices    
into a very dense piece of foam.

239
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,319
 it's dense because it will need
  to hold up to heavy traffic.  

240
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,590
  this is the dinosaur's foot.  

241
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,260
       he scoops out foam       
   in the center of the foot,   

242
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,461
     hollowing out an area.     

243
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,929
    then he carves out more,    

244
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,264
       following a pattern      
        of a size-12 shoe       

245
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,636
 so that a human foot could fit 
  inside this big mascot claw.  

246
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:32,143
  he rounds the outside of the  
  foam foot with a belt sander. 

247
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,012
 now the foot is fully sculpted 

248
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,615
            and ready           
   for the fabric department.   

249
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,817
     there, a worker sprays     
         heavy-duty glue        

250
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,419
  onto the outside of the foot, 

251
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,489
          and stretches         
 a nylon fleece fabric over it. 

252
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,090
  the fabric has a lot of give  

253
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,228
so that it can be tightly pulled
  into the grooves of the foam. 

254
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,031
     now she sprays adhesive    
      onto the bottom of it     

255
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,967
 and cuts off the excess fabric.

256
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,004
       she sews the seams       
    with a very tough thread.   

257
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,576
       then a worker glues      
      a rugged rubber sole      

258
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,046
         onto the bottom        
      of the dinosaur foot.     

259
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:14,252
     this is a toenail made     
 of nylon stuffed with polyfill.

260
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,522
      it takes three hours      
         to make a foot.        

261
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,390
 now it's back to the other end.

262
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,993
         he glues an eye        
      onto the mascot head.     

263
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,128
         the eye is made        
       of breathable nylon      

264
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,797
 stretched over a plastic frame.

265
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,666
 another worker sews on a horn, 

266
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,002
          which is made         
     of fabric-covered foam.    

267
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:35,940
      then she stitches on      
          the nostrils.         

268
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,076
       and now the mascot       
      has some expression.      

269
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,079
   but there's one more step.   

270
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,981
  he glues a white nylon screen 
         over the mouth         

271
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,083
           and sticks           
   black fabric strips over it  

272
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,021
  to give the mascot its smile. 

273
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,823
  now a worker drafts a pattern 
       for the outer body.      

274
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,959
         it will go over        
       an inner-body suit       

275
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,763
    that will give the mascot   
        its rotund shape.       

276
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,766
    she cuts the liner fabric   
       for the outer body,      

277
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,402
    following the pattern...    

278
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:09,774
    and then follows the same   
 pattern for the outside fleece.

279
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:14,778
she sews three layers -- fleece,
foam, and liner -- all together.

280
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,316
       this serger machine      
     cuts off excess fabric,    

281
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,886
and it sews and binds the edges.

282
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,456
  she hand-stitches the scales  

283
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:30,261
          onto the back         
     of the dinosaur mascot.    

284
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:35,132
    and now it's time to give   
  this mascot suit a test run.  

285
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,368
      it fits like a glove.     

286
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,007
    but what's the view like    
  from the<i> inside</i> of that head? 

287
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,276
        hmm. not too bad.       

288
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,213
    this dinosaur mascot suit   

289
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:53,184
    is ready to help its user   
        excite the crowd.       

290
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,503
            narrator:           
    when christopher columbus   
    discovered the new world    

291
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,239
    back in the 15th century,   
 he also discovered the hammock.

292
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,909
    it was in the west indies   
   that columbus found natives  

293
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,611
    lounging in what he later   
   described as sleeping nets.  

294
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,180
     and when hammocks were     
  introduced to the europeans,  

295
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,315
     they really caught on.     

296
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,418
     hammocks are still used    
        centuries later.        

297
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,324
            hammocks            
    were once called hamacks    

298
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,462
  because they were woven with  
  fibers from the hamack tree.  

299
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:40,565
       today they're made       
      of braided polyester.     

300
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,271
   to make a hammock, a worker  
  measures and marks the spots  

301
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,608
     for holes to be drilled    
   in a hardwood spreader bar.  

302
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,679
     he spaces the 22 holes     
     almost 3 inches apart.     

303
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,481
       he rounds the edges      
        of the wooden bar       

304
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,482
      with a shaped cutter      
        called a router,        

305
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,952
  smoothing out any sharp edges 
       that could jab you       

306
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,288
when you climb into the hammock.

307
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,890
    using an electric drill,    

308
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,494
   he makes holes a half inch   
  in size in the spreader bar.  

309
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,894
    then, with a countersink,   

310
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,698
     he scoops out the wood     
 around the edges of the holes, 

311
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,834
     to make a gentler slope    
     for the polyester rope.    

312
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,937
    he adheres the company's    
  prepasted label onto the bar. 

313
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,841
next, 16 bobbins turn at a speed

314
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,444
    that could make you dizzy   
         just watching.         

315
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:29,113
        they're spinning        
       the polyester cord.      

316
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,049
           the bobbins          
 twist the 16 polyester strands,

317
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,052
      braiding the strands      
   into a herringbone pattern   

318
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,655
    while electrical pulleys    
          draw them up.         

319
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:41,759
    the pulleys drop the cord   
           in a drum.           

320
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,396
          now it's all          
      in the wrist action.      

321
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,067
   a weaver deftly intertwines  
         the thick cord         

322
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,868
    into a triangular shape.    

323
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,803
          she's making          
     the hammock's harness.     

324
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,605
       it's called a clew.      

325
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,274
    she tugs each row tightly   
      to a ring at the top      

326
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,412
    to ensure that the weave    
          is steadfast.         

327
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:05,282
    as she weaves, she drapes   
     the long pieces of cord    

328
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,820
       over a wood frame,       
   to keep them from tangling.  

329
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,291
  after the triangle is formed, 

330
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,294
      she checks for errors     
          in the weave.         

331
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,029
 now she threads the clew cords 

332
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,498
        through the holes       
      in the spreader bar.      

333
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,167
        she snares a cord       
   with a large crochet hook.   

334
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,969
         using the hook,        
       she threads a cord       

335
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,771
through the hole at the furthest
     end of the spreader bar    

336
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,039
       and then knots it.       

337
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,110
      and she does the same     
  on the other end of the bar.  

338
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,647
       while the bar hangs      
        by the two cords,       

339
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,583
            she pulls           
   the rest of the clew cords   

340
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,786
through all 22 holes in the bar.

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,602
 next she positions the spreader
      bar under a guide bar     

342
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,403
  to ensure everything's level. 

343
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,805
          and she knots         
  the rest of the cords tightly 

344
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,941
       onto the underside       
      of the spreader bar.      

345
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,409
      it's a critical step.     

346
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,878
      if there's any slack      
          in the clew,          

347
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,883
    the yarn will stretch and   
 the hammock will be misshapen. 

348
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,488
      this hammock harness      
      is now strong enough      

349
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,492
 to support a 450-pound person. 

350
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,896
          next she uses         
       a 10-foot-long cord      

351
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,030
 to make a chain of small links 

352
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,501
      by pulling each link      
    through the previous one.   

353
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,904
 the top of the chain rope hangs
  from a hook, stabilizing it,  

354
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,907
     and allowing the weaver    
 to quickly turn the simple cord

355
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,310
into an intricate-looking chain.

356
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:47,318
    now she hooks each end of   
 the chain onto pins on a loom. 

357
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,720
     she weaves another cord    
         into the chain,        

358
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,257
          threading it          
      with a crochet hook.      

359
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,260
       she makes one loop       
    in about every sixth link   

360
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,695
       in the chain rope,       

361
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:02,733
     and she hooks that cord    
 onto the same pin as the chain.

362
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,935
         there's no rest        
     for the hammock weaver.    

363
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,270
      she takes a shuttle,      

364
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,873
    which is a piece of wood    
      with 656 feet of cord     

365
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,141
       wrapped around it.       

366
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,077
   she pulls it from below up   
   through the available loops  

367
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,278
       and then back down,      

368
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:18,749
    expertly weaving the web    
    that is the hammock bed.    

369
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,084
  she hooks a second chain rope 
          on the loom,          

370
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,690
      and threads the edge      
 of the woven bed to this chain.

371
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,626
 now she places the spreader bar
      of a finished harness     

372
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,294
     on one end of the loom.    

373
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,231
  she lines up the pins of the  
 loom with the holes of the bar.

374
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,435
 she knots the cord on each pin 
to a cord from the spreader bar.

375
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,238
     she repeats the process    
  at the other end of the loom, 

376
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:45,375
   binding the second harness   
       to the hammock bed.      

377
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,179
     she makes one last knot    
         in the chain...        

378
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,585
 ...and then removes the excess 
     cord with the heat gun.    

379
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,191
 the heat gun makes a clean cut 
with no ragged edges to unravel.

380
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,459
 with high-quality construction,

381
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:06,897
this hammock will surely provide
      years of relaxation.      

382
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,871
