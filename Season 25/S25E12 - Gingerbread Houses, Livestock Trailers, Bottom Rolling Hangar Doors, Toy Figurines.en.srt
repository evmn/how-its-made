00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,455
  narrator: gingerbread houses  
   are a holiday tradition.     

4
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,925
        it used to take         
     a fair amount of time      

5
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,861
      and baking expertise      
         to make one.           

6
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,864
   but today, there are kits    

7
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,266
     and even pre-assembled     
      gingerbread houses        

8
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,769
     that make the process a    
            breeze.             

9
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,481
    there's something about     
      this edible edifice       

10
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,217
    that makes the holidays     
      seem more special.        

11
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,886
          with a kit,           
    you can let the factory     

12
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,223
   handle the tricky part and   
              just              
 have fun with the trimmings.   

13
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,495
   to make a gingerbread house  
              kit,              

14
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,798
       the factory starts       
       with baking soda.        

15
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,570
       then a worker adds       
       a scoop of salt,         

16
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,139
   measuring the ingredients    
          by weight.            

17
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:53,145
  he transfers the baking soda  
     and salt to a mixer.       

18
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,383
   he measures the spices --    

19
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:01,253
   cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,    
         and allspice.          

20
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,055
        there's actually        
      a lot more cinnamon       

21
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,391
  than ginger in gingerbread.   

22
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:08,727
  but the flavor of the ginger  
      is more pronounced.       

23
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,229
     he closes the mixer,       

24
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,067
   and the system adds water,   
     molasses, and sugar.       

25
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,869
   at the top of the mixer,     

26
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,505
      he tosses in a block      
   of vegetable shortening.     

27
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,944
       the mixer combines       
      all the ingredients       

28
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,411
   and blends in the flour.     

29
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,415
         the result is          
      a putty-like dough.       

30
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:35,620
 a spiraling machine helps move 
  the dough onto a conveyor.    

31
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,622
 a roller flattens the chunks   

32
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:41,560
     so they won't fall off     
    during the steep climb.     

33
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,363
     the conveyor delivers      
      the chunks of dough       

34
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,700
to a machine called a sheeter.  

35
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:50,102
       it gets this name        

36
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,572
   because it rolls the pieces  
              into              
  a seemingly endless sheet.    

37
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,711
     a large cookie cutter      
          comes down.           

38
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:03,115
         it punches out         
   the various shapes needed    

39
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:06,752
to form the gingerbread house.  

40
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:13,859
    the cookie cutouts land     
on moving rubber-coated wires.  

41
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,527
 separators between the wires   

42
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,663
        trim the excess         
      gingerbread dough,        

43
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:21,400
       which is captured        
and mixed into the next batch.  

44
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:26,872
   then the cookies transfer    
      to a mesh conveyor,       

45
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:31,143
        which takes them        
  up to a baking sheet belt.    

46
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,748
   the cookies travel slowly    
through a long convection oven  

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,285
        that's heated to        
    just over 160 degrees.      

48
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,223
    here's an inside look.      

49
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,825
         at any time,           

50
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:49,261
    there are parts for 150     
gingerbread kits in this oven.  

51
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,433
     the baked gingerbread      
        exits the oven          

52
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:58,237
         and transfers          
     to a spiral conveyor.      

53
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,643
    after a 30-minute ride,     
  the dough is cool and firm.   

54
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:08,714
    workers stack the pieces    
   for one gingerbread house    

55
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,250
  onto a piece of cardboard.    

56
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:17,656
  they're ready to be packaged  
   with the rest of the kit.    

57
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,859
        factory workers         
      assemble the houses       

58
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:21,660
    for certain retailers.      

59
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,063
   they glue the gingerbread    
      structure together        

60
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,331
       with royal icing         

61
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,667
  made of confectioner's sugar  
        and egg whites.         

62
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,605
        it dries fast,          

63
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:36,876
 giving this gingerbread house  
 instant structural integrity.  

64
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,547
       for the customer,        

65
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,415
        all that's left         
      is the decorating.        

66
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,821
   elsewhere in the factory,    

67
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,757
      they make the icing       
         for the kits.          

68
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,165
 plastic packaging moves toward 
hot jaws that seal the bottom.  

69
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:06,772
  then a robot grabs a package  
      and opens the top.        

70
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:09,809
         a fill nozzle          
     pumps icing into it.       

71
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,915
     another robot applies      
       an applicator tip        

72
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,983
         and heat-seals         
    the plastic around it.      

73
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:22,388
   the tubes of sugary icing    
    fall on to a conveyor.      

74
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,724
 a worker places them in a box  

75
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,260
          for transfer          
 to the kit-assembly station.   

76
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,935
    these gingerbread houses    
     are ready for retail.      

77
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:46,779
    decorated with icing and    
             candy,             
 they look good enough to eat.  

78
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,362
 narrator: livestock should be  
   transported in a vehicle     

79
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,965
  that keeps them comfortable   

80
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,567
       and protects them        
    from injury and stress.     

81
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,237
      the best way to haul      
  cattle and horses humanely    

82
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,573
  is in a livestock trailer.    

83
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,943
  they're designed to be easy   
   to load, unload, and clean   
              out.              

84
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,849
  a proper livestock trailer    

85
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,319
      keeps its passengers      
  as comfortable as possible.   

86
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,054
 it's built to reduce rattling  

87
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,856
   and other stress-inducing    
            noises.             

88
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:35,727
   it lets in natural light,    
  which has a calming effect,   

89
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,866
   and it has openings along    
  the sides to circulate air.   

90
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,937
 a designer builds a 3-d model  
         on a computer          

91
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,473
 then breaks it down into units 
         for assembly.          

92
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,810
 the factory orders long pieces 
     of extruded aluminum       

93
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,213
designed for the trailer model  

94
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:58,083
         then cuts them         
     to specific lengths.       

95
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:04,023
     to construct the floor,    
             workers            
 slide planks into end rails.   

96
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,892
      they pull the planks      
       tightly together         

97
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:11,063
      using ratchet straps      
 then weld them to the rails.   

98
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,304
   they weld two flat aluminum  
              bars              

99
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:20,439
       across the planks        
      as floor supports.        

100
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:26,712
    the floor is upside down    
             during             
  this part of the assembly.    

101
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,246
    once they flip it over,     

102
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,450
        these supporters        
     will be under the floor    
            planks.             

103
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,454
 next, they install the axles,  
         two or three           

104
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,390
     depending on the size      
   and style of the trailer.    

105
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:42,194
       these steel axles        
 are mounted to a steel frame   

106
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,597
    that provides structural    
             support            
       for the trailer.         

107
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,099
     to attach the frame,       

108
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,735
        they drill holes        
     for lock bolts and lock    
            collars.            

109
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,271
    they use a special tool     

110
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,140
     to squeeze the collar      
      down into the bolt.       

111
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,577
     this ensures the bolt      
 won't loosen with vibration.   

112
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:04,350
 now they flip the floor over.  

113
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,619
   they weld the reverse side   
    of the rails to the floor   
             planks             

114
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,887
     using a track welder.      

115
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,763
    to construct the trailer    
             walls,             
      they weld together        

116
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,900
  horizontal slants, uprights,  
        and a top rail.         

117
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,904
    they connect the wall to    
    the floor then weld it in   
             place.             

118
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,708
    this trailer is designed    
      for a warm climate,       

119
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,578
     so the side walls have     
            openings            
    at the top to improve air   
             flow.              

120
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,516
  several parts of the trailer  
         are cut from           

121
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,786
  sheets of textured aluminum   
      called tread plate.       

122
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,056
        after welding on        
 a large piece of tread plate   

123
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:47,992
 for the trailer's front wall,  
    they attach the gooseneck   
             nose.              

124
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,797
 this nose connects the trailer 
to the back of a pickup truck.  

125
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,469
     it can also transport      
tools, feed, and baby animals.  

126
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,271
    trailers that don't have    
          a gooseneck           

127
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,739
  are called bumper hitches.    

128
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,142
          they connect          
 to the back of a tow vehicle.  

129
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,682
  workers attach the gooseneck  
  using welds and lock bolts.   

130
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,160
           they build           
  the trailer's access gates    

131
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,161
 the same way as the walls --   

132
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,497
  cutting aluminum extrusions   
     to specific lengths,       

133
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:31,303
        assembling them,        
     then welding the parts     
           together.            

134
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,104
     they mount the gates       

135
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:37,076
  by welding the hinge plates   
    to the wall structure.      

136
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,048
     the roof can either be     
      a sheet of aluminum       

137
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,418
   or a sheet of translucent    
      woven glass fiber.        

138
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,056
   they pull the sheet taut     

139
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:55,527
         then rivet it          
 to the top rail of the walls.  

140
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,597
 they add an aluminum strip to  
secure the roof in high winds.  

141
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,337
   workers install reflective   
              tape              
       and l.e.d. lights        

142
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,474
  where transport regulations   
         require them.          

143
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,343
        a rubber grommet        
       around each light        

144
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,813
       reduces vibration        
       and prevents water       
         infiltration.          

145
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,216
 workers complete the assembly  

146
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,419
   by mounting the wheels and   
              tires             
        onto the axles.         

147
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:23,155
     they add a spare tire      
      under the gooseneck       

148
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,691
   and a vinyl graphic decal    
       on the side wall.        

149
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,160
 after a thorough inspection,   

150
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,962
     they give the trailer      
       a mild acid wash         

151
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,166
      to remove any grease      
        and handprints.         

152
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:38,704
   the factory can customize    
      any trailer design.       

153
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,039
  this includes higher windows  
          for horses            

154
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,774
     or installing troughs      

155
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,011
     so the driver can give     
  the animals food and water.   

156
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,850
   every trailer is designed    
      for easy cleaning,        

157
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,986
         which includes         
   unloading the livestock,     

158
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,321
 removing the bedding material  
          and manure,           

159
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:00,159
  as well as pressure-washing   
          the floor.            

160
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,473
       narrator: a hangar       
is a closed building structure  

161
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:18,009
 designed for storing aircraft  
        or spacecraft.          

162
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,678
    they provide protection     

163
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,948
    from direct sun exposure    
       and bad weather.         

164
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,084
   as aircrafts grew bigger,    
     so did their hangars.      

165
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:31,056
       many hangars today       
    use giant bottom-rolling    
             doors.             

166
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,694
the bottom-rolling hangar door  

167
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,762
       moves along rails        
     embedded in the floor      

168
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,165
      and top guide beams       
    built into the ceiling.     

169
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,771
    they use several smaller    
             panels             

170
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,641
          to construct          
the 184-foot-wide hangar door.  

171
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,979
       an oxy fuel cutter       
       carves door parts        

172
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,448
 out of a carbon-steel plate.   

173
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,385
 the torches heat up the metal, 
  then blast it with oxygen.    

174
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,187
   this creates iron oxide,     

175
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,857
     which melts and flows      
        out of the cut.         

176
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,927
 the operator uses an iron rod  

177
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,931
   to lift the machined parts   
    off of the burn table.      

178
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,668
     he cleans up the edges     
   with an electric grinder     

179
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,739
   and removes any iron oxide   
              left              
over from the cutting process.  

180
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:25,677
       the machined parts       
       go to a cnc mill,        

181
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,547
  which turns each round blank  
         into a wheel.          

182
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,418
    a carbide insert carves     
   the rail's tread profile     

183
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,753
        into the steel.         

184
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:39,024
   the machine sprays coolant   
    to prevent overheating,     

185
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,926
        which would warp        
      the finished wheel.       

186
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,565
             next,              
   a machinist uses a smaller   
             blank              

187
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,434
to make an upper-guide roller.  

188
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,703
   the mill runs at a speed     

189
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,906
        of approximately        
   200 rotations per minute.    

190
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,908
   it quickly turns the round   
             blank              

191
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,112
     into a finished roller     
      ready for assembly.       

192
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:05,183
     a worker starts fitting    
             rollers            
 inside the upper guide head.   

193
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,119
        he inserts them         
      into machined holes       

194
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,824
      in the steel housing      
 and tack-welds them in place.  

195
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,264
     he positions the larger    
            rollers             

196
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,402
  outside the upper guide head  
           housing.             

197
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:27,272
         these rollers          
    will bear the load of the   
             door.              

198
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,074
    using a metal sheet as a    
             gauge,             

199
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,143
 he sets the clearance between  
  the roller and the housing    

200
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,813
then welds the parts together.  

201
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,687
     a cnc drilling machine     
       prepares to make         

202
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,357
       the outside frame        
      of the door panels.       

203
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:51,029
 a pressure sensor on the drill 
   moves its carbide insert     

204
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:55,667
 back automatically as soon as  
    it pierces the surface.     

205
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,772
     meanwhile, two welders     
            assemble            
     the bottom door truck      

206
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,375
       on a welding jig.        

207
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:06,578
       they weld a spacer       
       to the main beam         

208
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,047
 using an electric mig welder.  

209
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,586
   they tack-weld the tube in   
             place              

210
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:18,657
 then bring in the side channel 
  of the door truck assembly.   

211
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,864
  they clamp the side channel   
   tightly against the spacer   
             tube.              

212
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,270
     then weld the spacers      
         to the beam,           

213
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:36,007
   making a clean, continuous   
             weld.              

214
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:40,078
      a worker sand-blasts      
   the door truck assembly.     

215
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,281
   he blows compressed air and  
              sand              

216
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,518
  to prepare the metal surface  
         for painting.          

217
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,958
       using a spray gun,       
       a worker applies         

218
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,894
    corrosion-resistant metal   
             primer             
       on the door truck        

219
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,596
     and leaves it to dry.      

220
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:05,504
  workers assemble the panels   
   before the door leaves the   
             shop.              

221
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:08,773
     they use high-strength     
       structural bolts         

222
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,643
    to assemble the parts.      

223
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:17,916
        workers install         
      the unitized operator     
           assembly.            

224
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:22,187
     it contains the engine     
            powering            
   the bottom roller wheels.    

225
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,522
         a worker bolts         
 the electrical control panel   

226
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,858
    to the operator assembly    
             frame.             

227
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,197
    he puts the cabinet door    
    in place and secures the    
             hinge.             

228
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,031
    tightened brace cables      

229
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,601
      keep the door square      
     and prevent racking.       

230
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:41,940
   they mount the upper guide   
  on a telescoping assembly.    

231
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,476
      they add the door's       
  corrugated exterior panels,   

232
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,511
    and it's ready to ship.     

233
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,485
    at the push of a button,    
    the assembled door slowly   
             opens.             

234
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,954
        each panel rolls        
      on the bottom rail        

235
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:02,093
           and hangs            
   from the top guide rail.     

236
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:06,064
   the door opens wide enough   
 to let the aircraft through.   

237
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,183
narrator: playing make-believe  

238
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,520
      is a common pastime       
         for children.          

239
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,255
  research shows that playing   
 with dolls and toy figurines   

240
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,992
     can improve a child's      
          creativity,           

241
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,727
         communication,         
      and social skills.        

242
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,130
         this includes          
       problem solving and      
          empathizing.          

243
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,072
     whether it's an animal,    
             person,            
    or fictional creature,      

244
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,943
     a toy figurine can be a    
            passport            
      to a fantasy world        

245
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,212
    where imagination rules     

246
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,816
    and the story plays out     
     in the child's hands.      

247
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,622
    the toy company designers   
              study             
    photographs or drawings     

248
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,825
        of the creature         
     they plan to create.       

249
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,428
       then they prepare        
   a sketch of the figurine     

250
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,764
            showing             
 the physical characteristics,  

251
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:16,167
     such as size, colors,      
         and textures.          

252
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:24,375
 once the sketch is finalized,  
 they use specialized software  

253
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,312
      to transform it into      
    a 3-dimensional model.      

254
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,653
       then a 3-d printer       
   creates a plastic model.     

255
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:41,660
    the company also employs    
   traditional wax modelers.    

256
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:48,533
     it may look like a slow    
            process,            
but an experienced wax modeler  

257
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:52,804
        can often sculpt        
      a model faster than a     
           computer.            

258
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,614
    the company's engineers     
       determine whether        

259
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:09,153
   the toy should be produced   
    in one piece or multiple    
             parts.             

260
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:14,492
  then the modeler makes a wax  
 or plastic model accordingly.  

261
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,228
     this particular dino is    
             divided            
      into four parts --        

262
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,566
 head, body, jaw, and tongue.   

263
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,170
         for each part,         
    workers create a silicone   
             mold,              

264
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,840
   which will be used to make   
     several copies in hard     
            plastic.            

265
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,912
    workers place the model     
      of the dino's head        

266
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:37,382
            in a box            
     then fill the box with     
           silicone.            

267
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:41,185
    it takes about 12 hours     
   for the silicone to cure.    

268
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,856
     then they cut it open      
    and extract the model.      

269
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,458
  they use the vacated cavity   

270
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,861
        to cast several         
   hard-plastic copies of the   
             part.              

271
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,732
  the art department uses most  
     of them to sample paint    
            colors.             

272
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:58,803
   one copy, however, goes to   
  the company's tool makers,    

273
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,871
           who use it           
 to make the production mold.   

274
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:06,610
       they bury the copy       
 in putty up to the midpoint.   

275
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:12,216
    they leave the top half     
     of the copy exposed.       

276
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,486
         next, they set         
     the half-buried copy       

277
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,757
        in a metal form         
   and fill it with plaster.    

278
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,292
   once the plaster hardens,    

279
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,028
    they cure it in an oven     
       for about an hour        

280
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,097
  then they extract the copy.   

281
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,365
  what's left in the plaster    

282
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,569
    is a cavity in the shape    
     of half the dinosaur.      

283
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,905
      they fill the cavity      
       with molten zinc,        

284
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:39,377
      alloyed with copper,      
   aluminum, and magnesium.     

285
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,779
      once the metal cools      
        and solidifies,         

286
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,915
    they break the plaster,     
      revealing one half        

287
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,917
        of the two-part         
    metal production mold.      

288
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,121
 they repeat the entire process 
    to make the other half.     

289
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,324
         workers mount          
    the two-part dino mold      

290
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,860
     in an injection molding    
            machine.            

291
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,929
       the machine shoots       
      hot, molten plastic       

292
00:19:57,931 --> 00:19:59,197
  into the metal mold cavity.   

293
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,400
          the machine           
 immediately cools the plastic  

294
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,502
  then releases the figurine.   

295
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,808
      the plastic is solid      
        but still soft,         

296
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,610
 so they dip it in cold water.  

297
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,213
   this hardens it further.     

298
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,082
    next, artists hand-paint    
         the figurines          

299
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,086
     using both traditional     
        and airbrushes.         

300
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,758
     the paint is nontoxic      
       and very durable.        

301
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,628
   it's designed to flex with   
     the plastic to prevent     
           cracking.            

302
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,031
  it also withstands abrasion   

303
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:38,236
  because children often drag   
 these toys along the ground.   

304
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,573
     once the paint dries,      
    they assemble the toy.      

305
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,177
    a worker glues the dino's   
             tongue             
     into the hinged jaw,       

306
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:52,250
  snaps the jaw into the head,  
   then glues the head to the   
             body.              

307
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,055
      the company performs      
        safety testing          

308
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,725
      on every new figurine     
           designed.            

309
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,727
  this tensile test makes sure  
            a child             

310
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,664
     can't pull or bite off     
      a piece of the toy.       

311
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,465
  chemical analysis confirmed   

312
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,203
 both the plastic and the paint 
   are completely nontoxic.     

313
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,605
      so this dino may look     
           dangerous,           

314
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,442
        but in reality,         
   he's perfectly harmless.     

315
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:21,179
      this ferocious beast      
       is ready to hit the      
          playground.           

316
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,355
    if you have any comments    
        about the show,
