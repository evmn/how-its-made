captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,253
narrator: cycling shoes have cleats   

4
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,189
for bolting the foot to the pedal.         

5
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,726
the cyclist is connected to the bicycle, body and soul. 

6
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,730
bike shoes with clip-in cleats are a fairly recent innovation.

7
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,267
the first versions appeared in france in the 1980s

8
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,537
and were modeled after alpine ski bindings.      

9
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,144
avid cyclists are very attached
to their bicycles       

10
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,446
through special shoes that clip to the pedals.    

11
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,951
cycling shoes transfer power from the foot to the pedal   

12
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,588
more efficiently than ordinary shoes.      

13
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,425
to start, an overhead press  

14
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,895
drives cookie-cutter shapes called dyes          

15
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:40,299
through layers of fabric to punch out shoe parts.    

16
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:44,303
they use breathable nylon mesh for these upper pieces     

17
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:48,373
and synthetic leather     
for parts like the shoe toe box.

18
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,878
synthetic leather is rigid, waterproof, and lightweight.  

19
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,451
it takes 18 pieces of fabric to make one cycling shoe.   

20
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:01,988
this assembler pieces together the upper mesh parts      

21
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,257
and stitches on synthetic leather trim.    

22
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:11,664
she adds a synthetic leather side with vent holes.     

23
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,000
it gives the cycling shoe structure.           

24
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,008
with one half of the cycling shoe now complete, 

25
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,743
it's ready for the other half. 

26
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,278
she joins it to the other half at the toe end         

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,749
using high-density nylon thread.

28
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,888
the next part is the heel cup. 

29
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,889
it's a piece of molded polyurethane     

30
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,761
that adds strength and form  
to the back of the cycling shoe.

31
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:43,896
she stitches on trim      

32
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,533
and joins the heel cup     
to the rest of the cycling shoe.

33
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,373
next, using superstrong kevlar thread,         

34
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,577
she sews the toe box and tongue
to the cycling-shoe assembly. 

35
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,114
the configuration leaves open areas for mesh vents   

36
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,649
at the front of the shoe.   

37
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,586
the shoe upper is now complete and ready for the inner sole.  

38
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,724
it's made of high-density plastic.    

39
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:16,095
the employee tacks it to a foot mold using small nails. 

40
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,531
he sets it aside        

41
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,202
and places a pair of shoe uppers
in hot and rounded clamps   

42
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,539
to warm them to a pliable state.

43
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,076
he stretches each upper around a foot mold       

44
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,411
with a tacked inner sole.   

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,549
then it's over to a machine that oozes epoxy --      

46
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,752
a high-strength glue that is impervious to weather extremes.

47
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,156
the machine grips and folds the cycling-shoe upper     

48
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:45,357
to the sole          

49
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,627
as it applies epoxy to seal them together.     

50
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,629
the epoxy hardens quickly,   

51
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,233
and a computer-controlled grinder gets rid of the excess.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,772
now a spinning brush applies a different epoxy       

53
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:01,707
that will need heat to activate it.        

54
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,844
at the next station,      

55
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,780
a worker applies a release agent
to a mold.           

56
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,382
he inserts a piece of carbon fiber --   

57
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,451
a high-tech composite material.

58
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,653
he adds nylon for texture.   

59
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,722
he flips the upper part of the mold,          

60
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,458
and the two parts come together
like a waffle iron.      

61
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,128
inside, the layers melt into one
and then cool,         

62
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,532
creating a tough and lightweight
outer sole.          

63
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:32,938
they punch out vent holes and trim the edges of the sole.

64
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,476
they paint designs on to it and add a nonslip clear coat. 

65
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,081
he glues tough nylon mesh over the vent holes      

66
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,883
to keep the dirt out.     

67
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,419
he tapes the cleat mount onto it.            

68
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,622
it will be more securely installed    

69
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,491
for the individual cyclist at the bike shop.       

70
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,361
and after an application of epoxy,    

71
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,095
it's into the oven.      

72
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,363
at the same time,       

73
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,300
he heats the glue-covered outer sole in another oven.  

74
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,436
the heat activates the epoxy. 

75
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:09,507
it's time to join the outer sole
and the shoe upper.      

76
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,878
he carefully aligns them and presses them together.   

77
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,515
he then sets the shoe on a cradle,          

78
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:21,253
and hydraulic pushers     
apply pressure as the glue sets.

79
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,525
he presses the foot form that's still inside the shoe  

80
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,326
onto a sharp post,       

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,729
stabilizing it to pull the shoe off.     

82
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,999
the next employee installs a cable-closure device     

83
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,870
that acts like a shoelace but doesn't become tangled.  

84
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:41,473
she adds a ratchet-style plastic buckle.

85
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,277
crafted by hand using high-tech materials,   

86
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,547
it's taken about an hour to make these cycling shoes.  

87
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,283
and now they're ready for a spin.          

88
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,031
narrator: for centuries,    

89
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,034
yurts have been home to herders
on the asian plateau.     

90
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,704
they continue now for practicality and portability. 

91
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,174
today yurts used as second homes
or studio spaces        

92
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,244
offer durability, comfort,   

93
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:21,146
and a barely detectable footprint.           

94
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,785
this is the engineered, modern version         

95
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,987
of the ancient nomadic structure.       

96
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,524
compression and tension together
form freestanding yurts    

97
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,594
that today feature all the modern conveniences,  

98
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,465
including kitchens, dining areas, and lofts.    

99
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:44,135
the vinyl polymer roof     
is gradually shaped into a cone.

100
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,872
a worker folds the polymer,  

101
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,210
laying two edges beside each  
other on top of a formica board.

102
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:56,115
using a hot-air welder,    
he melts the two edges together.

103
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,687
a vinyl laminate valance is heat-welded         

104
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,956
to the bottom perimeter of the roof,          

105
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
creating a watertight connection.    

106
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:10,562
together, the workers pull the entire bottom perimeter  

107
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,132
of the roof through the heat welder.    

108
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,302
in the woodworking area,    

109
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,839
a worker drills a hole in a roof rafter.       

110
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,375
with a router, he cuts a notch 

111
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,845
that will eventually fit over a support cable.     

112
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,849
workers spray an oil finish onto the tooled rafters    

113
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,019
for aesthetics and added weatherproofing.   

114
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,125
to keep the rafter from slipping off its cable,  

115
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:44,996
a worker screws a keeper bolt 
into a brass thread in the hole.

116
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,798
he assembles the compression ring,     

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
which sits at the top of the yurt.    

118
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,738
he screws in rafter brackets made of galvanized steel.   

119
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,942
a worker uses silicone glue to attach a rubber gasket   

120
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,745
to the bottom edge of the roof's acrylic dome.  

121
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,414
the workers rest it on the compression ring,    

122
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,615
where it'll be held in place  

123
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:07,552
by cables and stainless-steel springs.  

124
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:11,289
they begin preparing the yurt's lattice wall.    

125
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,292
the vertical-grain pieces of douglas fir         

126
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,963
are dipped in water-based nontoxic penetrating oil.   

127
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,367
the pieces for the lattice wall

128
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,170
are placed in a multiple-head boring machine.

129
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,575
in one shot, it precision drills
200 identical holes      

130
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,578
through several pieces of wood.

131
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,714
a worker begins assembling the lattice wall.       

132
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,383
as he lines up the pieces of wood,      

133
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,119
he flexes them to test their strength.    

134
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,257
the alloy rivets he places   
in the holes will act as hinges.

135
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:49,327
he uses a pneumatic riveting machine to assemble the wall. 

136
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,998
its load-bearing capability, once fully assembled,     

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,535
is extremely high.       

138
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,139
larger yurts will have walls with as many as 200 pieces,   

139
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:03,942
while smaller yurts will have closer to 100.    

140
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,011
once riveting is complete,   

141
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,082
the worker makes sure the wall spreads properly.   

142
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,852
on-site,            
workers spread the lattice wall.

143
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,757
they bolt both ends      
of the lattice to the doorjambs.

144
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,694
a worker places the galvanized aircraft cable 

145
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,697
in the upper notch of the lattice wall.      

146
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,568
workers attach roof rafters to the compression ring.    

147
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,170
the ring end of the rafter is attached to the brackets  

148
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,438
with a through bolt,      

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,442
while the wall end of the rafter
attaches to the cable.     

150
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:40,645
the rafters are made of machined stress-rated wood, 

151
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:44,048
which can withstand the weight of snow.      

152
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,618
they level the compression ring.

153
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,455
they drape a polyester insulation lining 

154
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,723
over the rafters        

155
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,059
and fasten it securely in place.

156
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,130
they cover the insulation lining

157
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,101
with a highly-efficient reflective insulation.     

158
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:12,010
using fiberglass-reinforced aluminum tape,         

159
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,445
they seal the seam.      

160
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,283
the foil insulation rests   

161
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,420
between the lining underneath and the exterior roof.     

162
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,958
the workers now roll      
the vinyl laminate exterior wall

163
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,361
around the sides of the yurt. 

164
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:33,899
the exterior wall is securely laced into grommets

165
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,301
along the bottom edge of the roof valance.      

166
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,176
a worker standing in the compression ring    

167
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,980
hoists the acrylic dome up to the top of the roof   

168
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:51,049
and positions it on the compression-ring frame. 

169
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,720
yurt windows are sewn in with mosquito netting     

170
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,988
and have a clear vinyl covering.

171
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,094
all in all, yurt living means never pulling up stakes.    

172
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,675
narrator: marine plywood is used

173
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,944
in the construction of docks and boats.      

174
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,480
you can't use standard plywood in such wet environments.   

175
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,083
marine plywood isn't affected by moisture          

176
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,019
because it's made from sheets of a tropical hardwood     

177
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,021
that's naturally water-resistant

178
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,591
and bonded with water-resistant glue.   

179
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,696
marine plywood is typically used in boats   

180
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,499
for flooring, bulkheads, and furniture.         

181
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:44,236
the surface is typically a decorative type of wood veneer,

182
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,505
such as oak, maple, teak, or mahogany.       

183
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,109
the core, however, is made of bonded layers of okoume,  

184
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,577
a water-resistant species   

185
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,847
that grows in the hot and humid
equatorial forest of gabon   

186
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,582
in africa.           

187
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,052
when the okoume logs arrive at the factory,     

188
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,789
an automated chainsaw cuts half the shipment into pieces, 

189
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,259
measuring the length of a finished panel of plywood,

190
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,927
and the other half into pieces 

191
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,062
measuring the width of a finished panel.      

192
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,466
this produces logs with the grain running in one direction,

193
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,800
as well as logs        

194
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,202
with the grain running in the opposite direction.   

195
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,007
this is critical because    
when they construct the plywood,

196
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,477
they'll crisscross grain directions to add strength.  

197
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:29,347
next the logs go through a series of rotary blades   

198
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,617
that progressively shave off the bark.      

199
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,156
the now-barkless logs enter the rotary peeling machine.  

200
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,758
it works like a giant pencil sharpener,   

201
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,762
shaving off a continuous thin sheet called a ply,    

202
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,697
hence the term plywood.    

203
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:50,035
the ply is between 1/100 and 1/10 of an inch thick,   

204
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,037
depending on its position in the finished panel.     

205
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,306
blades on both sides trim the ply,         

206
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,243
producing neat, straight edges.

207
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,513
then the machine rolls up the ply.       

208
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,186
the next machine unwinds the continuous ply   

209
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,922
and slices it into separate plies.      

210
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,790
if the log that produced this roll    

211
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,192
was one of those cut      

212
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,862
to the eight-foot length of a finished plywood panel,  

213
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,997
then this machine makes a cut every four feet -- 

214
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,400
the width of the finished panel...    

215
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,403
and vice-versa.        

216
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:28,272
this thickness of plywood has a five-ply core.      

217
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,875
three of the plies remain dry, 

218
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,877
while two go through this machine,    

219
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,945
which rolls strong, water-resistant glue      

220
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,681
simultaneously on both sides. 

221
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,618
now assembly begins.      

222
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,555
alternating grain directions, the first ply is a dry one,  

223
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,956
the second a glued one.    

224
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,893
the bottom of it sticks to the ply underneath --

225
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,629
the top to the dry third ply that goes over it.       

226
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,099
the next ply -- the fourth -- is a glued one.        

227
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,368
the bottom sticks to the ply underneath,       

228
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,571
and the top to the fifth and final ply a dry one above. 

229
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,442
workers use a powerful pneumatic staple gun

230
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,577
to attach this assembled core along the front edge      

231
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,248
so that it doesn't come apart as it enters the press.    

232
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,854
the press holds 10 core assemblies at a time. 

233
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,923
the current thickness of a core

234
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,725
is the sum of the piles plus glue.           

235
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,129
the press will reduce that by 10%.            

236
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:28,332
it applies about 170 pounds per square inch of pressure,  

237
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,135
while at the same time     

238
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,404
heating the core to 250 degrees fahrenheit   

239
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,941
to literally cook the adhesive.

240
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,145
the core exits the press after seven minutes,      

241
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:45,550
the plies now perfectly flat and solidly bonded.      

242
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,820
the wood veneer for the core's decorative facing is very thin,

243
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,823
barely more than 1/100 of an inch.       

244
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:55,093
to create a pattern resembling a hardwood floor,  

245
00:14:55,095 --> 00:15:00,165
they join two strips at a time with a wavy thread of glue.  

246
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,370
next they join the two mated strips to two others,

247
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,439
and so on,           

248
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,241
until the assembled veneer   

249
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:12,177
are the length and width of the plywood core.      

250
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,047
the core, meanwhile, goes through the glue machine, 

251
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,316
which coats both top and bottom
with adhesive.         

252
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:22,521
the veneer sheet is also glued,
but on one side only.     

253
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:25,657
workers lay the veneer glued-side up         

254
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,693
then carefully place the core onto it.            

255
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,398
a second veneer, glued-side down, goes on top. 

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,002
the okoume core is now sandwiched       

257
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,804
between two decorative wood veneers.  

258
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,474
the press applies the same heat and pressure   

259
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,142
as it did to the core assembly,

260
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,944
but for just one minute.    

261
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,213
the result -- a finished sheet of,      

262
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,883
in this case, cherry veneered marine plywood.

263
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,555
marine plywood comes not just in a variety of veneer choices,

264
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:58,824
but also in a range of thicknesses.   

265
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:02,360
typically comprised of three to 13 plies --    

266
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,962
always an odd number      

267
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,566
in order to have equal weight on
either side of the central ply 

268
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,501
for balance.          

269
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,320
narrator: there are many types of paints at an artist's disposal,    

270
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,789
each producing a very different effect.    

271
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,792
oil paint is opaque and rich. 

272
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,394
encaustic paint, being wax-based,        

273
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,197
has a unique texture that the artist can shape,   

274
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,101
then reheat, and reshape in countless creative ways.  

275
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,274
oil paint comes in liquid form and stick form.        

276
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,611
with either, the artist can combine it with other products 

277
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:54,613
to modify the consistency.   

278
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:58,884
being oil-based, the paint takes a couple of days to dry, 

279
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:00,685
so there's lots of times to work with it.        

280
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,889
however, once the coat is dry, it can't be reworked.     

281
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,560
encaustic paint, by contrast, is wax-based,         

282
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:11,496
so the artist must melt it while applying it.       

283
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,165
because wax cools and hardens so quickly,          

284
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,835
encaustic paint has a short working time.   

285
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:20,205
however, the artist can    
reheat it and work it some more.

286
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,242
the main ingredient in encaustic paint       

287
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,977
is white beeswax.       

288
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,912
to that, they add carnauba wax,

289
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,383
which comes from the leaves of the carnauba palm tree.   

290
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,718
carnauba wax is quite fragile, 

291
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,789
which is why they strengthen it
with beeswax.         

292
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,724
they melt them in a microwave oven      

293
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,859
on convection mode.      

294
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,263
next they add dammar resin,  

295
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,600
which comes from trees native to southeast asia.   

296
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:52,270
they grind the chunks of resin into of powder         

297
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,805
in a coffee grinder,      

298
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,341
then mix it into the molten waxes.       

299
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,943
the resin will act as a solidifying agent,    

300
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,746
as well as make the paint glossy.     

301
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,016
once the ingredients are evenly blended,       

302
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,151
they pour the mix through cheesecloth      

303
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,021
to filter out minute plant particles,    

304
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,223
which the resin contained.   

305
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,493
they weigh out a quantity of synthetic pigment      

306
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,163
and add it to the wax-resin mixture.   

307
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:21,700
the ratio of pigment to mixture
varies by color.        

308
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:24,302
some have more wax and less pigment        

309
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,304
and others vice-versa.     

310
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,240
this manufacturer won't reveal any specifics   

311
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,375
about ingredient proportions. 

312
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,312
its paint recipes are top-secret.        

313
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,781
after mixing for about 15 minutes,     

314
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,250
the paint is ready.      

315
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,120
they carefully pour it into a mold.          

316
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,557
this type of mold produces sticks.        

317
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,466
the paint hardens in just a few minutes.     

318
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,003
they scrape off the excess and melt it back to liquid   

319
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,339
to cast the next batch of sticks.           

320
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,411
then they unscrew the mold and pry it apart.       

321
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,618
once the mold is safely opened,

322
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,523
they gently extract the finished encaustic sticks. 

323
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:28,099
they wear gloves        

324
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,168
because the sticks are still a bit hot      

325
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,337
and can stain their hands.   

326
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,307
for those same reasons,    

327
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,611
they wrap the sticks, once labeled, in plastic.   

328
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:46,584
this manufacturer also produces
handmade encaustic paint    

329
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,521
in another format -- rectangular blocks.       

330
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,890
the process is identical.   

331
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,929
the mold is made of flexible rubber.      

332
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,799
the paint hardens sooner than in a metal mold      

333
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,736
because rubber dissipates heat far faster than metal does.  

334
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,413
workers don't need to wear gloves   

335
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,881
when extracting the blocks   

336
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,083
because the paint is already cool        

337
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,386
and therefore won't stain their hands.    

338
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,758
to make oil-paint sticks,   

339
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,563
they first make a large batch of oil paint out of walnut oil,

340
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,232
pigment, a drying agent, and a bit of wax.       

341
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,768
then they weigh out a specific quantity      

342
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,903
and add more walnut oil.    

343
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,843
next they add combined carnauba wax and beeswax,   

344
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,780
which are necessary to form the stick shape,    

345
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,782
however less wax than for encaustic sticks.   

346
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,386
they blend all these ingredients
for about 15 minutes,     

347
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:59,256
then pour the paint into a metal mold to cast sticks.  

348
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,794
every batch of oil sticks undergoes drying tests     

349
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:05,529
to ensure the paint dries within two days        

350
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,832
after being applied to paper. 

351
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,336
encaustic is the more durable of these two types of paints  

352
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,405
because it contains a larger percentage of beeswax,

353
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,207
which is resistant to moisture.

354
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,343
and encaustic painting, therefore,           

355
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,813
doesn't have to be varnished or put behind glass.
