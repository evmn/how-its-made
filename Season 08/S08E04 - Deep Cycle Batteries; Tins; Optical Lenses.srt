00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,492
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,194
     deep-cycle batteries...    

3
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,066
           ...tins...           

4
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,806
     ...and optical lenses.     

5
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,189
  a deep-cycle battery is what  
    you find in such vehicles   

6
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,791
    as trains, boats, r.v.s,    
      and forklift trucks.      

7
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,928
 whereas a car battery provides 
    a quick surge of current    

8
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,262
      to start the engine,      

9
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,398
  a deep-cycle battery provides 
   a steady amount of current   

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,635
   over a long period of time.  

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,413
   deep-cycle batteries range   
       from 2 to 48 volts.      

12
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,083
    their power is generated    
            by cells,           

13
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,020
  a group of lead plates coated 
     in lead oxide and acid.    

14
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,355
      this casting machine      
      produces lead grids       

15
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,025
   that will become the plates  
       in the power cells.      

16
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:36,027
  the machine pours molten lead 
     into grid-shaped molds.    

17
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,762
        water circulating       
        through the mold        

18
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,697
        hardens the metal       
      in just five seconds.     

19
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,701
        the machine casts       
      two types of grids --     

20
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,470
    negatives and positives.    

21
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,109
the next machine coats the grids
      with a chemical paste     

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,378
          that contains         
      lead oxide and acid.      

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,847
          the positives         
   get one paste formulation.   

24
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,649
 the negatives, a different one.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,521
the grids are now called plates.

26
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,656
  workers stack them in cases,  

27
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,992
           alternating          
     positive and negative,     

28
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,128
     then drop them in tanks    
   of sulfuric acid to charge.  

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,699
     the lead oxide and acid    
  in the paste store the power. 

30
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,737
         after charging         
       for 24 to 72 hours,      

31
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,205
     depending on the model,    

32
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,609
  the plates go into a machine  
  that washes them three times  

33
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,077
     to remove acid residue,    

34
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,646
         which, if left,        
    would corrode the metal.    

35
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,085
      the charging process      
      blackens the plates,      

36
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:38,022
      which are now called      
       dry-charge plates.       

37
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,426
  a machine wraps each positive 
    in glass-strand matting,    

38
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,429
     an insulation material     
     similar to fiberglass,     

39
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,498
   then in a plastic envelope.  

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,035
     these coverings protect    
 the plates from short circuits.

41
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,373
          workers stack         
       the plates again --      

42
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,976
       positive, negative,      
       positive, negative.      

43
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,380
  this time, though, each stack 
  contains a specific number -- 

44
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:05,717
      from 5 to 33 plates,      
 depending on the battery model.

45
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,652
each stack will become one cell.

46
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,523
         a cell provides        
     2 volts of electricity.    

47
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,992
      each plate has a tab.     

48
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,729
    a robotic machine cleans    
   the tabs with a wire brush   

49
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,198
     and a chemical solution    
          called flux.          

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,734
      then it dips the tabs     
         in molten tin.         

51
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,936
        this tin coating        
      will improve the bond     

52
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,273
        when they solder        
       the tabs together.       

53
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,743
    the robot wipes the tabs    
    on a flux-imbued sponge     

54
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,112
     to clean their surface     
          once again...         

55
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:40,552
  ...then drops the cells into  
 a mold containing molten lead. 

56
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,688
 this solders the tabs together,

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,157
       bonding the plates       
       within each cell.        

58
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,827
the process casts two lead posts
   on the cell's positive side  

59
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,696
  and two on its negative side. 

60
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,964
           these posts          
     will connect the cells     

61
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,766
 and build the required voltage.

62
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,577
      next, each cell goes      
   into a polypropylene casing  

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,112
          called a jar.         

64
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,947
       they test each cell      
   to make sure it functions.   

65
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,451
 this also shows if the cell is 
 positioned correctly in the jar

66
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,388
    so that the positive and    
negative signs on the cell cover

67
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,124
             will be            
   on the corresponding posts.  

68
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,069
    they heat-seal the cover    

69
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,672
  and seal the protruding posts 
           with lead.           

70
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,608
       to test the seals,       
  they pump air into the cell,  

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,144
     then brush soapy water     
         over the cover.        

72
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,114
   any bubbles indicate a gap   
         to be resealed.        

73
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,957
 in another part of the factory,

74
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,759
      workers manually mold     
    various small components    

75
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,128
        from molten lead.       

76
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,433
      among those parts --      

77
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,404
         the connectors         
 that link one cell to another. 

78
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,515
 workers weld them to the posts.

79
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,118
   these are 8-volt batteries,  
        so for each one,        

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,488
     they connect four cells    
   inside a polyethylene case.  

81
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:30,128
 now that assembly is complete, 
     the case cover goes on.    

82
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,999
these rubber grommets keep water
       from seeping inside      

83
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,869
    and shorting the battery.   

84
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,538
    now they fill the inside    
       with sulfuric acid,      

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,340
         which functions        
       as an electrolyte,       

86
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,476
     the medium that helps      
     the lead in the plates     

87
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,178
      conduct electricity.      

88
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,692
      narrator: the tin can     
 was invented back in the 1800s 

89
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,094
    to preserve and protect.    

90
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,430
          we still rely         
    on this trusty container    

91
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,899
         to keep a range        
     of perishables fresh --    

92
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,636
  everything from food to blood 
  plasma to military supplies.  

93
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,972
    and after all these years   
             of use,            

94
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,075
        the tin can still       
   has an airtight reputation.  

95
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,718
    it's time to lift the lid   
  on this traditional container 

96
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,387
    and get the inside story    
        from the factory.       

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,323
         to make a tin,         
 they take a strip of tin steel 

98
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,059
  and weld it to join the ends. 

99
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,263
 the resulting cylindrical shape
     is the body of the tin,    

100
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,599
         and it's about         
   to be hermetically sealed.   

101
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,137
       the rotating tools       
         on this machine        

102
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,908
    stretch out the edges of    
 the cylinder, forming a flange.

103
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,757
      they top off the tins     
        at this station,        

104
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,361
  where a spinning head presses 
  the cylinder into these lids. 

105
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,764
     it simultaneously rolls    
   the flanged edges together   

106
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,967
    to make an airtight seal.   

107
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,112
         this container         
 is for classified military use,

108
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,315
       but over on another      
        production line,        

109
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,650
         they're making         
     a more standard tin --     

110
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,920
            the kind            
   you would put coffee in --   

111
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,121
        so this assembly        
       is more mechanized.      

112
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,190
   in a fraction of a second,   

113
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,593
       an automated welder      
     rounds and joins metal     

114
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,528
  to create the body of a tin.  

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,199
         the tins travel        
       forward and upward       

116
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,800
 on a magnetic conveyor system. 

117
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,003
 they're going to the other side
          of the plant,         

118
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,306
        where they'll get       
        tops and bottoms.       

119
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,019
        this kind of tin        
  has a reusable slipcover lid  

120
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,088
 and gets some decorative work. 

121
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,493
    like a big cookie cutter,   
 a punch press cuts out designs 

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,696
    that have been preprinted   
            on metal.           

123
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,097
        at the same time,       
    it pushes the cut design    

124
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,933
           onto a die           
     to form the lid shape.     

125
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:30,241
       a magnetic conveyor      
       pulls them forward       

126
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,944
       and flips the lids       
   to stack them for packing.   

127
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,319
     elsewhere in the plant,    

128
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,855
       they're making cans      
   to go with some other lids.  

129
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,692
   a lineup of circular blades  
   slices through tin sheets.   

130
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,031
    the cut pieces accumulate   
           in stacks.           

131
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,009
they load the flat pieces of tin
        into a cylinder,        

132
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,012
where they're curled into tubes.

133
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:20,291
   as they exit, robotic arms   
 make seams in the rolled tins, 

134
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,293
    and a press applies force   
          to lock them.         

135
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,629
this lock seam is an alternative

136
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,565
        to the welded one       
         we saw earlier.        

137
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,711
 now, another magnetic conveyor 
  pulls the tin tubes forward,  

138
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,980
     and they go for a spin     
 while rollers flange the edges 

139
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,283
       so that the bottoms      
        can be attached.        

140
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,525
       then a punch cutter      
       makes the bottoms,       

141
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,128
           making sure          
     to recycle the scraps.     

142
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,199
    the can bottoms spin out    
       of the punch cutter      

143
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,437
         before landing         
on the next magnetized conveyor.

144
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,679
        they get a squirt       
        of liquid rubber,       

145
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:19,417
 which will harden into a gasket
  to prevent leaks in the can.  

146
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,555
        a folding machine       

147
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,892
      now locks the bottoms     
   to the tubes as they spin.   

148
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,960
 more than 12,000 cans per hour 

149
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,931
           can be made          
   on this high-speed line...   

150
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,038
 ...from a blank piece of steel 
   to a very useful container.  

151
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,639
    whatever their contents,    

152
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,442
     these tins are destined    
       for a full life --       

153
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,412
 that is, until someone decides 
         to empty them.         

154
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,731
   narrator: it's time to turn  
        our camera's eye        

155
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,132
      on the camera's eye.      

156
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,868
         optical lenses         
    are really several lenses   

157
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,737
  combined into a single unit.  

158
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,407
    together, they re-create    
 an image by bending light rays,

159
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,278
 so they converge into a common 
 point called the focal point.  

160
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,024
  these television lenses start 
   with a very precise design.  

161
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,560
         a diamond blade        
        slices up a block       

162
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,164
      of specially selected     
         optical glass,         

163
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,633
while coolant prevents the blade
        from burning it.        

164
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,304
    the slices then go under    
        a diamond drill,        

165
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,974
  which cuts several puck-sized 
   disks from one glass slice.  

166
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,044
     the operator is careful    
   to keep waste to a minimum.  

167
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,682
optical glass costs up to $1,000
         for 2.2 pounds.        

168
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,734
      during the drilling,      

169
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,936
     the optical glass sits     
   on a thinner piece of glass  

170
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,405
        covered with wax.       

171
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,275
 as the wax is melted, the disks
     are easily pulled away.    

172
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,821
      next, a device spins      
        one of the disks,       

173
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,657
     while a wheel overhead     
     sculpts it into a lens.    

174
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,440
  the operator checks each lens 
           for chips,           

175
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,108
   and this one looks smooth.   

176
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,047
     this tarlike substance     
        is called pitch.        

177
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,516
      the edges of the lens     
  have been built up with tape  

178
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,185
      to contain the pitch.     

179
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,224
    they completely coat the    
 underside of the lens with it. 

180
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,999
  several pitch-covered lenses  
    are now in a metal shell.   

181
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:25,203
a worker picks up a hot aluminum
  dome called a blocking body.  

182
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:29,006
       he presses it onto       
    the pitch-covered lenses,   

183
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,342
  and the pitch melts onto it.  

184
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,216
      dousing it with water     
   causes the pitch to harden,  

185
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,953
       sealing the lenses       
      to the blocking body.     

186
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,297
       the blocking body        
       is now upside down       

187
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,698
 and acting as a holding device 

188
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,835
        as it oscillates        
  on a spinning grinding shell. 

189
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,044
       the grinding makes       
    the surface of the lenses   

190
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,379
       uniform and smooth.      

191
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,657
      they place a polisher     
         on the lenses.         

192
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,427
         it's lubricated        
   with a very fine abrasive.   

193
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,198
       for about an hour,       

194
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,734
     the polisher oscillates    
     while the block spins.     

195
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,404
   polishing makes the lenses   
     smooth and transparent.    

196
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,541
       it also gives them       
  an even more curved profile.  

197
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,419
  the lenses have been removed  
         from the block,        

198
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,155
      and it's time to cut      
   the diameter down to size.   

199
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,694
       using a microscope,      

200
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,998
   a technician centers a lens  
    between two brass chucks.   

201
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,568
   a diamond blade at the back  

202
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,970
          cuts the lens         
  as a technician monitors it.  

203
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,839
  he's making sure the diameter 
      and axis of the lens      

204
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,075
      have a common center.     

205
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:20,184
  next, they group some lenses  
 on round racks called planets. 

206
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,788
         their universe         
      is a vacuum chamber.      

207
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,463
 the technician closes the door,

208
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,799
         and the planets        
      continue their orbit.     

209
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,338
       inside this vacuum,      

210
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,607
        an electron beam        
  evaporates coating materials. 

211
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,277
     the vapor rises to give    
  the lenses a protective coat. 

212
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,682
  a computer monitors the rate  
 of evaporation and the coating.

213
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,684
 but there's much more to come. 

214
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,553
      up next, this process     
       really gets visual       

215
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,624
        as all the pieces       
 of a camera lens come together.

216
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,236
   narrator: the optical lens   
  is the ultimate image maker.  

217
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,704
       along with cameras,      

218
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,241
 you'll find them in projectors,
  microscopes, laser scanners,  

219
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,576
      and x-ray equipment.      

220
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,712
   they give us a closeup view  
       of so many things.       

221
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:25,182
    it seems only appropriate   
   that we take a closeup look  

222
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,985
   at the optical lens itself.  

223
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,726
           the lenses           
   have just spent three hours  

224
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,661
  getting a protective finish.  

225
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,566
 it's time to wipe any residue  
 and make sure they're perfect. 

226
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,342
this particular lens is concave.

227
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,744
   she covers it to protect it  

228
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,945
        while she cleans        
      and inspects the lens     

229
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,782
  with the opposite profile --  
             convex.            

230
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:07,958
      then the convex lens      
   goes to another technician,  

231
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,028
          who places it         
      in a holding device.      

232
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,898
 he looks into a microscope and 
adjusts the position of the lens

233
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,299
 until it's optically centered. 

234
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,842
  he uses wax to keep the lens  

235
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,412
          from shifting         
     in the holding device.     

236
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,586
       they give the lens       
       another cleaning.        

237
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,788
        each one must be        
       absolutely spotless      

238
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,258
       before they proceed      
        to the next step.       

239
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,592
    otherwise, dust particles   

240
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,928
      could become trapped      
    within the optical system   

241
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,131
    and affect image quality.   

242
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,134
     now that the surface of    
 the convex lens is immaculate, 

243
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,770
     she dabs optical cement    
     onto the center of it.     

244
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:03,080
she gives the other concave lens
     a little more scrutiny     

245
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,284
      before she cements it     
      onto the convex lens.     

246
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,087
      she applies pressure      

247
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,289
      to spread the cement      
     between the two lenses.    

248
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,892
     cementing them together    
  means they'll be less likely  

249
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,428
         to shift around        
       in the lens barrel.      

250
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:25,636
       she checks for dust      
         one more time.         

251
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,638
 then it's under the microscope 

252
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,374
    for an optical alignment    
      of this double lens.      

253
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,710
       because the cement       
         isn't yet dry,         

254
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:36,447
 he can push the top lens around
    and adjust its position.    

255
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,121
   next, they prep the barrel   
   that will hold the lenses.   

256
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,257
          a technician          
      traces out lettering      

257
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,793
     using a stylus attached    
         to a sharp tool        

258
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,562
    that engraves information   
      onto the lens barrel.     

259
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,869
   it prints technical details  

260
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,739
 that will tell the photographer
  just what the lens will do -- 

261
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,474
    things like focal length,   
          the f-number,         

262
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,611
          and the size          
    of the aperture opening.    

263
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,080
     these reference points     
         allow the user         

264
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,450
  to pull a picture into focus  
  at the desired magnification. 

265
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,228
now they double-check the design
for this complex optical system 

266
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,998
        and begin to pull       
    all the pieces together.    

267
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,639
  this singlet, or single lens, 

268
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,040
            goes into           
     the metal barrel first.    

269
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,510
          other lenses          
     with various curvatures    

270
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,012
     and dimensions follow.     

271
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,187
she places metal spacers between
  the lenses to separate them.  

272
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,522
   proper spacing will prevent  
    aberrations in the image,   

273
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,325
        such as blurring.       

274
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,676
     between installations,     

275
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,145
   she covers the barrel with   
  a piece of lint-free plastic  

276
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,282
    because eliminating dust    
  continues to be a necessity.  

277
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,319
      one fleck could ruin      
      this entire assembly.     

278
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:33,964
   using tweezers, she coaxes   
 the last lens into the barrel. 

279
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,835
she installs a retaining ring to
 hold the stack of lenses down. 

280
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:41,372
  then she locks it into place. 

281
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,440
  there's one final inspection. 

282
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,311
   she examines the assembled   
  optical lens from all angles. 

283
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,379
  it takes a total of six weeks 

284
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,116
           to make one          
    of these optical lenses,    

285
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,386
         and in the end,        
      it's picture-perfect.
