 narrator: thomas jefferson, one
 of america's founding fathers, 

6
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,492
came up with the first swiveling
  mechanism for office chairs.  

7
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,426
         decades later,         
         charles darwin         

8
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,529
       added small wheels,      
         called casters,        

9
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,898
     to his chair to roll it    
        around the study        

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,567
          as he worked          
   on the theory of evolution.  

11
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,704
      today, office chairs      
     still swivel and roll.     

12
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:18,209
        the office chair        
   has become a status symbol.  

13
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,513
     executive versions have    
       kingly dimensions.       

14
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:25,317
     they're extremely plush    
and have serious lumbar support.

15
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,288
      using a hydraulically     
        powered machine,        

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,458
     a worker bends 14-gauge    
      steel tubing to form      

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,661
    the bottom cushion frame.   

18
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,731
   he joins the ends and welds  
    steel bars to the middle.   

19
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,667
      the bars will support     
          the mechanism         

20
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,004
          for adjusting         
    the position of the seat.   

21
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,477
     he hooks s-shaped steel    
     springs from the front     

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,446
 to the back of the seat frame. 

23
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,649
      these sinuous springs     
     will eventually provide    

24
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,286
         a flexible web         
   of suspension in the seat.   

25
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,957
 he positions the rods laterally

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,492
  and clips them to the springs 

27
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,427
    for additional stability    
          and support.          

28
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,830
   the office chair seat frame  
        is now complete.        

29
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:16,368
      next, a worker builds     
     the chair's back frame.    

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,638
       the frame includes       
     a spine lumbar support,    

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,374
      armrest attachments,      
        and other parts.        

32
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:26,044
    he grinds burrs and other   
   rough spots from the steel.  

33
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,181
  in the upholstery department, 

34
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,617
     another worker smoothes    
         a leather hide         

35
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,953
     so that it sits evenly     
      on the cutting table.     

36
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:39,291
    he cuts out the patterns    
 following cardboard templates. 

37
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:43,195
   as he cuts, he works around  
 the natural flaws in the hide, 

38
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,599
   making calculated decisions  
       to minimize waste.       

39
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,935
      by cutting carefully,     

40
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,603
      he'll be able to get      
         all the leather        

41
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,673
     he needs for one chair     
      from this large hide.     

42
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,474
        that's important        

43
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,876
     because color and grain    

44
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,713
   can vary from hide to hide.  

45
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,881
   using pieces from the same   
     one will give the chair    

46
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,050
 a consistent look and texture. 

47
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,356
  once all the leather pattern  
  pieces have been accumulated, 

48
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,092
    another worker cuts foam    
     cushioning for backing.    

49
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:18,329
     the density of the foam    
      in the chair varies.      

50
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,832
     he uses more rigid foam    

51
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,800
         for the chair's        
      contoured cushioning      

52
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,602
   so it will hold its shape.   

53
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,676
  another worker selects softer 
 foam for the part of the chair 

54
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,345
    that the occupant's back    
       will rest against.       

55
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,153
     he cuts slits into this    
      softer back padding.      

56
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,322
      this creates channels     
      that will ultimately      

57
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,224
    become a design feature.    

58
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,364
   using chalk, he draws lines  

59
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,166
 onto the corresponding leather 

60
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,102
       that match up with       
     the slits in the foam.     

61
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,906
 a worker aligns the chalk lines
         in the leather         

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,076
         with the slits         
           and puckers          

63
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,144
     the leather as he sews     
       the backing to it.       

64
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,113
   this forms a ribbed pattern  

65
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,783
        in the upper half       
    of the chair upholstery.    

66
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,055
  he stitches the padding flat  

67
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,057
      to many of the other      
         pattern pieces.        

68
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,293
      this particular part      
         is a side panel        

69
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,729
   for the back of the chair.   

70
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,034
   returning to the upholstery  
      with the ribbing now,     

71
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,538
        he sews contoured       
      casings to each side.     

72
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,479
      to complete the back      
          of the chair,         

73
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,214
  workers add a chipboard panel 

74
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,116
    and encase the structure    
           with foam,           

75
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:48,120
          then cover it         
  with the leather upholstery.  

76
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,522
       once the chair seat      
      has been upholstered,     

77
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,658
      an employee installs      
         a plastic cover        

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,060
      to enclose the back.      

79
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,130
       he screws a sliding      
       plate to the base.       

80
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,033
    this mechanism will work    
  in conjunction with the plate 

81
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,868
    to slide the seat forward   
          and backward,         

82
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,171
   depending on legroom needs.  

83
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,806
      it also has features      
          for adjusting         

84
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,575
the tilt and height of the seat.

85
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,311
     the hydraulic cylinder     
          for adjusting         

86
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,778
    the seat height is next.    

87
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,483
    the cylinder also doubles   
      as the chair's stem,      

88
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,020
and it swivels to allow the seat
     to rotate 360 degrees.     

89
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:26,357
    he attaches the aluminum    
      base to the cylinder.     

90
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,962
      he snaps the casters      
into slots in the aluminum base.

91
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,365
       he equips the back       
       of the office chair      

92
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,568
    with an automobile-style    
            headrest.           

93
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,506
the prongs fit into the brackets
       in the chair frame.      

94
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,510
        finally, he locks       
  the armrests into the frame.  

95
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:48,013
 this office chair is now ready 

96
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,948
   to make someone's desk job   

97
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,817
     a lot more comfortable.    

98
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,001
 narrator: vinobrew is just what
       the name implies --      

99
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,669
       vino, meaning wine,      

100
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,604
            and brew,           
       referring to beer.       

101
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,106
      this hybrid beverage      
  is part of a fledgling trend  

102
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,043
  by some adventurous breweries 
          and wineries          

103
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,112
  to merge their two otherwise  
   separate worlds of alcohol   

104
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,115
           and create           
         a unique drink.        

105
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:29,521
      this vinobrew is made     
   from port-style sweet wine,  

106
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,457
dark strong beer known as stout,

107
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,860
     and another ingredient     
    that's brewed -- coffee.    

108
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,696
       this concoction is       
   the collaborative creation   

109
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:41,199
   of a winery, microbrewery,   
      and coffee producer.      

110
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,502
     the microbrewery grows     
   some 20 different varieties  

111
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,738
          of hop plants         
      whose flowers contain     

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,441
  the resins and essential oils 
    that give beer its bitter   

113
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:53,178
  and aromatic characteristics. 

114
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,079
            to begin            
    the beer-making process,    

115
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,016
  the brewmaster fills a tank,  
       called a mash tun,       

116
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,719
           with water,          
     then ignites a burner.     

117
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,592
 when the water heats to around 
     150 degrees fahrenheit,    

118
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,628
he pours in a blend of different
         types of malts.        

119
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,063
     malts are cereal grains    
         such as barley         

120
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,198
 or corn which have been soaked 

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,335
   to kick-start germination,   
      then, once sprouted,      

122
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,038
       dried with hot air       
      to halt germination.      

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,442
     stirring the malt into     
          the hot water         

124
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,111
        activates enzymes       
    that convert the starches   

125
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,448
          in the grain          
    into fermentable sugars.    

126
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,517
      after an hour or so,      
  he transfers just the liquid, 

127
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,120
          called wort,          
       to the boil kettle       

128
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,223
       and gradually adds       
  different varieties of hops.  

129
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,292
  he brings the wort to a boil  

130
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:45,130
      to kill off bacteria      
        and sterilize it.       

131
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,665
         next, he cools         
     the wort and transfers     

132
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,334
  it to the fermentation tank.  

133
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,436
       then he adds yeast.      

134
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,638
  over the next 10 to 14 days,  

135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,974
       the yeast consumes       
     the fermentable sugars     

136
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,777
          in the wort,          
  converting them into alcohol  

137
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,048
  and producing carbon dioxide  
   gas, which creates bubbles.  

138
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,784
     this process transforms    
       the wort into beer.      

139
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,654
     at the coffee company,     

140
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,224
      the hot coffee beans      
     must be cooled quickly     

141
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,960
 after coming out of the roaster
  so that they don't overcook.  

142
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,996
         this perforated        
        cooling pan stirs       

143
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,231
        the beans to help       
       dissipate the heat,      

144
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,734
        then a commercial       
      coffee grinder grinds     

145
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,705
         the beans into         
      coarse-ground coffee.     

146
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,374
        to prepare coffee       
        for the vinobrew,       

147
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,843
      a worker puts grounds     
       into a filter bag,       

148
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,379
        saturates the bag       
        with cold water,        

149
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,648
then submerges the bag in water,

150
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,818
    letting the grounds soak    
       for about 16 hours.      

151
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,189
    then he pours the coffee    
        into a large jar.       

152
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,060
         at the winery,         
       winemakers harvest       

153
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,329
      and press the grapes,     

154
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,364
   add yeast and ferment them,  

155
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,965
     then age the port wine     

156
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,369
      for at least 2 years      
         in oak barrels.        

157
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,170
  to prepare to make vinobrew,  

158
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,839
   the winemakers test samples  

159
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,407
     from different barrels     
           for acidity          

160
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,175
  and sweetness to help decide  

161
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:08,714
 which wines to potentially use.

162
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,582
          the winemaker         
       and the coffeemaker      

163
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,285
  then experiment with amounts  
         of those wines         

164
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,953
 and different cold-brew coffees

165
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,289
        made from various       
         types of beans.        

166
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,459
  the brewmaster also joins in, 

167
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,929
       measuring out beer.      

168
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,301
         this process is        
     as much art as science.    

169
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,237
   for each batch of vinobrew,  

170
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,740
   the respective makers play   
 with a selection of ingredients

171
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,208
    and with the proportions,   

172
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,910
      tasting and smelling      
           the samples          

173
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:44,182
  to evaluate aroma, sweetness, 
    bitterness, and acidity.    

174
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,450
     what they try to create    

175
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,519
      is a harmonious blend     
     of the three elements,     

176
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,288
 a new flavor without the taste 

177
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,091
       of any one element       
     dominating the others.     

178
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,662
       once they pin down       
      the winning formula,      

179
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,598
      they replicate it on      
  a large scale for production. 

180
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,269
        the winery pumps        
        the selected wine       

181
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,041
 from storage tanks into barrels
  for transport to the brewery. 

182
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,479
         at the brewery,        
      the brewmaster pumps      

183
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,880
   the required amount of wine  

184
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,784
       from those barrels       
      into a blending tank.     

185
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,823
  he pours the required amount  

186
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,593
      of cold-brewed coffee     
     into the blending tank.    

187
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,932
          then he pumps         
       the required volume      

188
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,268
     of beer into the tank.     

189
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,870
    beer makes up the largest   
    proportion of the recipe,   

190
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:43,775
        followed by wine,       
          then coffee.          

191
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,977
         after blending         
  the ingredients in the tank,  

192
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,480
      the brewmaster pumps      
  the vinobrew into a beer keg. 

193
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,749
         then he injects        
       carbon dioxide gas       

194
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:55,119
    to add more carbonation.    

195
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,088
          when you pour         
      a glass of vinobrew,      

196
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,656
        the bubbles rise        
           to the top,          

197
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,893
      producing foam known      
          as beer head.         

198
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,296
    but while this might look   
   and feel like regular beer,  

199
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:09,234
 one sip tells you that vinobrew
     is uniquely different.     

200
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
            narrator:           
  to refinish a hardwood floor, 

201
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,254
       one has to sand it       
  with a floor-sanding machine. 

202
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,623
   after a few thousand hours   
          of operation,         

203
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,393
the machine's drum, which drives
    the sandpaper, wears out.   

204
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,995
         the contractor         
       can either replace       

205
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,097
        it with a new one       
        or send the worn        

206
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,001
  one out to be reconditioned.  

207
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,369
    this company specializes    

208
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,905
        in reconditioning       
       worn sander drums,       

209
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,410
    that means restoring them   
     to like-new condition.     

210
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,213
   a drum can be reconditioned  
     as many as eight times     

211
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,082
  before it has to be replaced. 

212
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,851
 the first step is to grind off 

213
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:04,022
   what's left of the aluminum  
   drum's worn rubber surface.  

214
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,124
        it gets worn down       
 due to the drum rotation speed 

215
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,027
         of up to 2,600         
     revolutions per minute     

216
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,031
    and often gets damaged by   
  running over protruding nails 

217
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,800
        or carpet tacks.        

218
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,037
    a worn drum doesn't hold    
   the belt of sandpaper taut,  

219
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,274
    which causes the machine    
 to slip to the left and right, 

220
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,910
    rather than sand smoothly   
       in a straight line.      

221
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,115
    a worker places the drum    
      on a press to detach      

222
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:34,085
 the arbor shaft, which attaches
the drum to the sanding machine.

223
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,522
     when the drum was new,     

224
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,292
       its aluminum sides       
      were freshly painted.     

225
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:43,528
        that paint is now       
        mostly worn away.       

226
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,998
 sawdust and rubber residue fill
 the drum's nooks and crannies, 

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,303
   so a worker places the drum  
   inside a sandblast cabinet   

228
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:54,839
   and puts his hands through   
    gloves that reach inside.   

229
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,941
 he holds the drum in one hand, 

230
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,043
      a sandblasting nozzle     
          in the other,         

231
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,813
      and in a few minutes,     
      the drum is pristine.     

232
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:07,018
but it still has an ever-so-thin
   layer of rubber remaining,   

233
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,920
    so another worker mounts    
       the drum on a lathe      

234
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,257
    and shears off the rubber   
          with a knife.         

235
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,358
         then he passes         
        the knife again,        

236
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,027
      removing a mere tenth     
  of a millimeter of aluminum.  

237
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,398
    this exposes a new smooth   
        aluminum surface.       

238
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,234
   then a worker cuts a sheet   

239
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,437
       of brand-new rubber      
       to the exact length      

240
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,406
         needed to cover        
 the circumference of the drum. 

241
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,309
 the rubber is nearly two-thirds
        of an inch think,       

242
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,577
   roughly twice the thickness  

243
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,880
        of the worn layer       
        they grinded off.       

244
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,815
         after clamping         
          it down flat,         

245
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,885
 the worker applies an adhesive 
      designed for rubber.      

246
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,992
         then he sprays         
          an accelerant         

247
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,894
 onto the drum's primed surface 

248
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,064
     to strengthen its bond     
        with the rubber.        

249
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,967
     he lets the accelerant     
        dry for 6 hours,        

250
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,003
   then spreads a second coat   
    of adhesive on the rubber   

251
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,473
  and wraps it around the drum. 

252
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,010
    twenty-four hours later,    
    with the adhesive cured,    

253
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,980
      another worker mounts     
  the drum on a lathe and trims 

254
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,650
      off the excess rubber     
        from both sides.        

255
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,988
 he then sands the trimmed edges

256
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,325
  to make them perfectly flush  
   with the sides of the drum.  

257
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,797
       the drum goes back       
       on the grinder now       

258
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,167
     to finalize the overall    
      diameter of the drum.     

259
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,204
 using a ruler, a worker adjusts
     a measuring instrument,    

260
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,573
        called a caliper,       
  to the diameter measurement.  

261
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,542
 he then grinds down the rubber 
        a bit at a time,        

262
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,845
          spot-checking         
   with the caliper regularly.  

263
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,416
    the worker stops grinding   
        once the caliper        

264
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:49,087
        check tells them        
  the drum diameter is correct. 

265
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,722
        if a sanding drum       
    isn't perfectly balanced,   

266
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,426
           it vibrates          
    and disfigures the floor,   

267
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:58,062
   so a worker mounts the drum  
     on a balancing machine.    

268
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,365
        he applies a band       
         of masking tape        

269
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,333
     and draws a black line     
           on the tape          

270
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,202
       to give the machine      
        a reference point       

271
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:07,739
 from which to start measuring. 

272
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,808
as the machine rotates the drum,

273
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,745
   a sensor measures velocity   
  on both sides simultaneously. 

274
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,282
         if the velocity        
         is inconsistent        

275
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,684
         on either side,        
      he balances the drum      

276
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:25,356
      by adding or reducing     
   weight on the problem side.  

277
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,658
        to reduce weight,       

278
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,427
     a worker drills a hole     
       to remove aluminum.      

279
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,831
     to add weight, he fills    
   the drilled hole with tin,   

280
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,267
   a metal that's far heavier   
  than the aluminum he removed. 

281
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,540
         the final step         
    is to repaint the sides.    

282
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,343
    a worker masks the rubber   
         with a template        

283
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:49,313
  then sprays the aluminum with 
  rust-inhibiting metal paint.  

284
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,649
     now this main component    
        of a floor sander       

285
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,184
       is as good as new,       

286
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,688
   ready to bring a worn wood   
       floor back to life.      

287
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,370
            narrator:           
   lithography was discovered   

288
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,807
     when german playwright     
        alois senefelder        

289
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,810
       had no paper handy       
   for writing a laundry list.  

290
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,779
 so he wrote it down on a stone 
      using a grease pencil     

291
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,282
 and stumbled onto a new method 
          of printing,          

292
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,284
         one that relies        
    on the chemical aversion    

293
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,952
      of grease and water.      

294
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,726
 lithographs can rival paintings
      for detail and mood.      

295
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,895
       they have a unique       
         visual quality,        

296
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:41,832
   and that's why making them   
    hasn't become a lost art.   

297
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,869
       a lithograph starts      
   with a flat limestone slab.  

298
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,572
       the artist confirms      
       the same thickness       

299
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:51,141
  all the way around the slab.  

300
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,844
  she now resurfaces the stone  

301
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,446
      using a grinding tool     
       called a levigator.      

302
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,549
          she wets down         
    the surface of the stone    

303
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,017
        and the levigator       
     to allow the levigator     

304
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,820
      to move freely across     
   the stone during grinding.   

305
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:07,725
  the artist sprinkles silicon  
   carbide grit on the stone.   

306
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,461
     she spins the levigator    
      across the stone and,     

307
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,831
     together with the grit,    
  it grinds off the top layer.  

308
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,867
      this process removes      
          the previous          

309
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,070
   drawing and preps the stone  
        for the next one.       

310
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,639
    she finishes the grinding   
      with a finer abrasive     

311
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,808
      to give the limestone     
        a smooth finish.        

312
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,578
        once the residue        
      has been rinsed off,      

313
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,949
       the stone is ready       
       for a fresh image.       

314
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,719
   she brushes a natural gum,   
       called gum arabic,       

315
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,787
        around the edges,       
        creating a border       

316
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,489
 that will be receptive to water

317
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,824
    but not the printing ink.   

318
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:43,194
       this process makes       
        a non-image area.       

319
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,063
       the artist marks up      
        a piece of paper        

320
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,701
   with a crayon made of wax,   
       charcoal, and clay.      

321
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:53,370
      she places the paper      
 on the stone, crayon-side down,

322
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,474
       and sets a drawing       
       upside down on top.      

323
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,810
      she tapes the drawing     
          to the stone.         

324
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,647
    she now follows the lines   
   of the figure on the paper   

325
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,116
         with a pencil,         
        pressing firmly.        

326
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,851
   this transfers the drawing   

327
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,555
    to the stone and creates    
     a reversed image on it.    

328
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,058
      the artist simulates      
         specks of snow,        

329
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,626
        with a technique        
        called stippling,       

330
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,929
  with gum arabic and a brush.  

331
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,931
    she fills in the drawing    
     using a greasy crayon.     

332
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,202
       the stone picks up       
 and holds the greasy substance.

333
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,138
       these crayons come       
 in varying degrees of hardness.

334
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,976
  once the artwork is complete, 

335
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,745
 she dusts the image with rosin 

336
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:37,248
   which is a tree sap powder,  
   followed by a talc powder.   

337
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,685
  this will ultimately protect  
    the image during etching.   

338
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,889
         the artist then        
       brushes gum arabic       

339
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,924
          onto the art          
      to protect the stone      

340
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,994
    from the corrosive nature   
    of the etching material,    

341
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,497
      a mix of nitric acid      
         and gum arabic.        

342
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,369
       this mixture alters      
    the surface of the stone    

343
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,771
     so that the image areas    
        will attract ink,       

344
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,107
     and the non-image areas    
         will repel it.         

345
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,078
   she places a sheet of paper  
       on the print stone       

346
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,714
      and applies lubricant     
          to the bottom         

347
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,916
of the scraper bar on the press.

348
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,020
   she spreads more lubricant   
         onto a tympan,         

349
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,789
a thin sheet of durable plastic,

350
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,160
      that she's placed on      
 the paper-covered print stone. 

351
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,764
 this allows the stone to slide 
under the pressure of the press.

352
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,934
        the artist moves        
  the sliding press bed forward 

353
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,736
     so that the lithography    
           stone sits           

354
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,738
 directly under the scraper bar.

355
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,574
   she turns the mechanism to   
  tighten the bar to the stone. 

356
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,643
 she moves the press bed forward

357
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,413
      to test the pressure      
       of the scraper bar.      

358
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,717
 she confirms that the pressure 
   is sufficient for printing   

359
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,418
       but not too tight.       

360
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,955
           satisfied,           
     she removes the tympan.    

361
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,157
      she washes the crayon     
         from the stone         

362
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,293
      using highly refined      
        mineral spirits.        

363
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,829
         what remains is        
      a ghost of the image.     

364
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:03,768
      the artist then rubs      
   a petroleum-based substance  

365
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,771
 onto the stone that will serve 
     as a base for the ink.     

366
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:12,543
     the substance attaches     
   to the image on the stone.   

367
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:17,682
   using a big leather roller,  
   she picks up oil-based ink.  

368
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,484
      an assistant dampens      
  the stone with a wet sponge.  

369
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:24,955
      the artist transfers      
   the ink to the damp stone.   

370
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,558
        the greasy parts        
  of the stone pick up the ink  

371
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,260
   while the wet parts don't.   

372
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,296
     the assistant moistens     
        the stone again.        

373
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,166
        the artist places       
     a sheet of print paper     

374
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,903
   cut to size over the image.  

375
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,106
      she covers the stone      
   with clear plastic tympan.   

376
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,141
   the press bed rolls forward  

377
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,111
  until the stone sits directly 
     under the scraper bar.     

378
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:51,549
     the preset bar applies     
       the exact pressure       

379
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,951
         needed to print        
    the image onto the paper.   

380
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,288
      the artist carefully      
        lifts the paper,        

381
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,292
   revealing a perfect mirror   
        image of the art.       

382
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,396
      using the same stone,     

383
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,398
   she can make hundreds more,  

384
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,734
     each one a work of art.
