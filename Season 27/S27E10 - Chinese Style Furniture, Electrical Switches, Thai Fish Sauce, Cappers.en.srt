narrator: classic chinese furniture is made of rich,    

4
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,790
lacquered woods with intricate carvings     

5
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:01,994
and ornate artwork in mother-of-pearl inlay.    

6
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,664
for centuries, the specialized skills      

7
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,999
required to craft these functional works of art  

8
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:13,072
have been passed down      
from generation to generation.  

9
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,808
the style of this striking rosewood sideboard        

10
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,346
dates to the tang dynasty of the 7th and 9th centuries --               

11
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,216
a period considered a golden age of chinese arts.  

12
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,086
this manufacturer is located in thailand.     

13
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,255
its design team consists of a conceptual designer     

14
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,759
who merges the structure and aesthetic features,     

15
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,628
a specialist who ensures the historical accuracy     

16
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,696
of the piece,          

17
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,165
and artists who draw the patterns      

18
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,700
for the elaborate wood carving  

19
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,704
and the intricate mother-of-pearl inlays.     

20
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,839
the team produces a highly detailed blueprint   

21
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,976
and makes several copies of the artwork patterns     

22
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,178
for the craftspeople to use.   

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,648
to make each inlaid cabinet door,       

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,451
a woodworker glues the pattern onto the wood,    

25
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,853
making sure that it's perfectly centered.  

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,059
then using a router, he cuts about 3 millimeters deep,    

27
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,662
making a groove along the pattern's perimeter  

28
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,063
and cutting out the parts    

29
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,532
that will be inlaid with mother-of-pearl.      

30
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,805
meanwhile, using another copy of the pattern,         

31
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,206
a worker makes templates     

32
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,876
by cutting out the same parts the woodworker routed      

33
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,146
out of the cabinet door.     

34
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:31,283
each template is marked either pink, white, or green.  

35
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,953
she glues it into a 3-millimeter-thick piece              

36
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,756
of the corresponding color of mother-of-pearl.       

37
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,561
the next craftsperson takes one piece at a time,    

38
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,630
and holding it steady with pliers,       

39
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,565
carefully saws around the template       

40
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,435
with a 1-millimeter-wide blade.             

41
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:51,370
once she's cut all the pieces,  

42
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,905
she reassembles the pattern.   

43
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,640
the next craftsperson spreads  

44
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,178
adhesive paste into the cutouts in the cabinet door.       

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,783
then he fills each cutout    

46
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,786
with its corresponding piece of mother-of-pearl.       

47
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,457
five hours from now,       

48
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,459
once the adhesive has dried,   

49
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,862
he runs a sander over the design to remove the paper       

50
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,330
and excess adhesive,       

51
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,767
smooth the wood, and polish the mother-of-pearl.        

52
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:28,407
then an artist etches fine detail into the mother-of-pearl.        

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,481
this provides texture, dimension, and expression    

54
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,683
to objects and characters,    

55
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,920
which, until now, were merely blank shapes.    

56
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,492
high-end chinese-style furniture like this            

57
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:50,696
is traditionally made of heavy and sturdy rosewood.  

58
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:56,101
they first dry the wood to a humidity level of 11%.   

59
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,170
this prevents components from expanding          

60
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,839
or contracting significantly   

61
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,507
with temperature changes, which is critical        

62
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,842
because the sideboard      

63
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,311
is made of traditional jointed construction.      

64
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,313
the parts lock together     

65
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,150
without any nails, screws, or glue.         

66
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,656
to prepare pieces that will have a carved design,             

67
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,826
a worker glues a copy of the pattern onto the wood.  

68
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,202
next, a woodworker drills a small hole in each area    

69
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:33,672
of the pattern to be cut out.  

70
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,542
he feeds a thin saw blade through the hole...       

71
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,980
...then saws out the area.    

72
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,353
once he cuts out all the required areas,     

73
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,757
he hands the piece to one of the company's carvers.    

74
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,161
these artisans apprentice for years       

75
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,765
with the master carver to learn this ancient craft.   

76
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,836
working with a collection of chisels,           

77
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,138
they gradually follow the pattern.       

78
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,509
it takes tremendous talent    

79
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,179
and skill to know how to read a drawing      

80
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,516
and, bit by bit, transform the flat wood beneath it     

81
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,853
into a three-dimensional design.             

82
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,121
once all the components are ready,            

83
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:27,393
workers assemble the sideboard from the footed base upward.   

84
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:30,663
the drawers move on modern drawer slides,     

85
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,130
and the cabinet doors attach   

86
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,067
with bronze chinese-style hardware.     

87
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,868
they bring out the rich color  

88
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,937
and grain of the wood with four coats         

89
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,406
of traditional lacquer      

90
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,409
made entirely from tree sap.   

91
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,613
it highlights the etched details in the mother-of-pearl      

92
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:51,250
and protects the sideboard with a glossy shield.      

93
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,034
narrator: light switches put a lot of power at your fingertips.           

94
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,103
one quick flick, and the lights go on or off.   

95
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,172
when switches are paired with sockets,          

96
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,242
appliances and gadgetry can also be powered up.     

97
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,579
invented as an improvement   
over pull cords a century ago,  

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,582
switches deliver power to the people.          

99
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,054
flip a switch, and the world   

100
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,523
instantly becomes a brighter place.        

101
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:36,395
switches give us power over electrical power.      

102
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:42,534
making switches starts with big sheets of metal.    

103
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,737
in this case, the sheets are brass.      

104
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,607
a worker serves them up to a hydraulic guillotine.    

105
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,677
it chops the brass into strips  

106
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,478
that will be used to make faceplates        

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,149
for custom-sized switches and sockets.           

108
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,618
for switches that are a standard size,         

109
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,488
they simply order the strips precut.        

110
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,026
computerized punches cut holes  

111
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,761
and rough out both the faceplates       

112
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:09,962
and the steel grids       

113
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:12,331
that hold the electrical structure together.       

114
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,504
all the holes in the grid plates             

115
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,906
will correspond to holes in the faceplates        

116
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,175
in order to put the two together.     

117
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,377
these plates are for switches  

118
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,645
that will be installed in hotel rooms,         

119
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,718
and they will include sockets for three-pin british plugs.   

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,255
next, more steel unwinds into a punch press,       

121
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,791
which transforms it into a framework to support   

122
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,994
the electrical components.    

123
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,329
the automated tooling wraps the punched metal     

124
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,333
around a form to give it the desired shape.  

125
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,469
this framework will also serve  

126
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,871
as an electrical grounding plate,         

127
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,406
discharging electrical energy  

128
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:57,142
from the socket to prevent shocks.        

129
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,881
a worker now attaches a molded plastic part      

130
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,816
to a grounding plate.      

131
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,285
he inserts a screw in a brass connector       

132
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,122
and installs it in a slot in the molded plastic.      

133
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,995
he installs a series of brass terminals.       

134
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,964
at the next station,       

135
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,034
a worker assembles fuse holders,            

136
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,237
contacts, and springs to the plastic structure.    

137
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,180
next up are little spring- operated plastic shutters.    

138
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,448
they block the sockets      

139
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,384
when nothing is plugged into them.      

140
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,521
moving down the assembly line,  

141
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:47,860
a worker inserts springs into twin rocker switches.    

142
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,327
she lowers a press        

143
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,730
to squeeze all the switch components together,       

144
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:56,801
then transfers the switches to the electrical unit.     

145
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,605
another technician snaps a cover onto it.      

146
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,207
he plugs it into a light box to test it,           

147
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,409
and the bulbs of the box illuminate.           

148
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,612
this confirms that the switches        

149
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,081
and sockets are fully operational.      

150
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,853
he pulls the plug and sets the assembly aside.   

151
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,757
it has taken roughly four minutes       

152
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,094
to assemble the switch and socket unit.         

153
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,566
a worker now fits the steel grid plate to it    

154
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:32,104
with the switches and sockets protruding through it.      

155
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,438
this particular unit       

156
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,975
is also equipped with a round european plug    

157
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:42,781
and a usb charging port for mobile devices.       

158
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,250
at the next station, an operator serves up      

159
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,988
brass faceplates to a press that bends the rims,              

160
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,225
forming a thin lip that will fit around the grid plate.    

161
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,464
a computerized welder fuses studs           

162
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,331
to the back of the faceplates,  

163
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,668
placing one at each corner.   

164
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,670
these studs will fix the faceplate          

165
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,138
to the grid plate        

166
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,707
and provide a screwless finish on the front.          

167
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,478
when it comes to switch and socket combinations,     

168
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,748
there's no shortage of options.            

169
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,017
at this station, a worker assembles        

170
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,952
a particularly large one with switches,          

171
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,756
charging ports, and sockets.   

172
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,558
it's also designed for installation         

173
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,895
in a hotel room.         

174
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,232
he secures the charging port to the grid plate        

175
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,168
and is ready for the faceplate.           

176
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,443
he attaches it using the welded studs,     

177
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:49,648
and with the folded edging, it 
encases the grid plate neatly.  

178
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,718
this switch and socket assembly is now complete.         

179
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,656
when switched on, the circuit will be closed,   

180
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,526
and the electrical current will flow.            

181
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,794
when switched off, the circuit will open,      

182
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,064
and things will go dark.     

183
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,300
it should work every time.    

184
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,283
narrator: in many east asian cultures,   

185
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,954
salt is not traditionally used as a condiment.         

186
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:32,423
in its place, cooks use high-sodium sauces   

187
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,226
such as fish sauce.       

188
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,962
in thailand, fish sauce is a key ingredient       

189
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,397
in traditional dishes, giving them a rich        

190
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,633
and distinctive savory taste.          

191
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,773
used in cooking or as a dipping sauce,      

192
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,108
thai fish sauce brings out the flavors      

193
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,780
of other ingredients.      

194
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,648
fish sauce is made by fermenting      

195
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,317
two parts fish with one part salt.       

196
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,053
over time, the salt will naturally extract water   

197
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:06,191
from the fish's flesh, creating the savory sauce.    

198
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,462
the factory processes 100 tons of fish every day.   

199
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:15,734
they use wild-caught anchovies from the gulf of thailand.    

200
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,736
anchovies have a strong flavor,             

201
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:22,674
so even small amounts can be used to flavor dishes.  

202
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,878
they mix two parts fish with one part natural sea salt.              

203
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,549
the ingredients fall down a chute into a rotating drum.  

204
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,754
as it spins, it evenly mixes the salt and the fish.      

205
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:38,290
this is faster than mixing by hand,       

206
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:42,427
ensuring quicker processing times.        

207
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,296
when the mix is ready,      

208
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:48,900
it's taken to one of the 3,000 fermentation wells on-site.   

209
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:53,372
the bottom of the well is already filled with sea salt.              

210
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,375
they add the salt-fish mixture and spread it around       

211
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,377
so that the surface is flat.   

212
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,314
they finish by covering the mixture     

213
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,650
with a thick layer of sea salt.              

214
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:11,723
each fermentation well can hold 10 tons of fish and salt.    

215
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,859
they cover the well with a cement corrugated sheet.             

216
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:19,197
the temperature inside can reach 104 degrees fahrenheit.     

217
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,199
they sometimes remove the cover         

218
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,269
to expose the sauce to sunlight.            

219
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,737
from time to time,        

220
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,006
they sample the sauce for inspection.         

221
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:32,611
salt crystals form naturally on the surface.         

222
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:35,680
after 12 to 18 months of fermentation,         

223
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,549
first-grade sauce is pumped out          

224
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,684
from the bottom of the fermentation well     

225
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:44,623
with layers of salt acting as a natural filter.   

226
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,559
fish sauce is stored in large fiberglass tanks.    

227
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,095
employees take samples      

228
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:54,599
and send them to the lab for quality testing.       

229
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,168
after filtering and sweetening the sauce slightly        

230
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,173
with 5% sugar, they are ready for bottling.   

231
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,577
after a visual inspection,    

232
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,512
bottles head to the filling area.       

233
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:12,117
the machine grabs each bottle and fills it from the bottom up.               

234
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,386
fish sauce does not need to be pasteurized        

235
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:19,157
as filtration has already eliminated most bacteria.    

236
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,728
also, the sauce contains over 25% salt.     

237
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,729
this high-sodium content prevents             

238
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:29,067
any harmful bacteria from proliferating.       

239
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,269
because of the sauce's intense flavor,         

240
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,205
it is generally used in moderation.       

241
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,675
so bottle caps have a small dropper hole    

242
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:40,478
to facilitate use of the sauce during cooking.   

243
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,815
next, brushes apply adhesive labels to the body   

244
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,284
and neck of the bottle.     

245
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,620
this factory produces three different grades      

246
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:49,955
of fish sauce          

247
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,558
for a total of 15 million liters every year.           

248
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,762
after a second visual inspection,        

249
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,832
bottles proceed to the packing department.    

250
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:05,303
the machine pushes them forward, aligning them in position.    

251
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:09,641
by now, the bottle caps have been safety-sealed.     

252
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,243
a robotic carrier picks up    

253
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,846
36 bottles to fill three boxes at once.       

254
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:18,183
a metal frame keeps the carton cases open   

255
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,518
as the machine inserts the bottles.       

256
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,788
the tasty sauce will be sold locally or exported     

257
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,224
to one of 70 different countries.    

258
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:30,462
in the food-science laboratory,           

259
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,733
technicians perform       
several quality-control tests.  

260
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:35,667
they start by measuring     

261
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,869
the salt content of the product          

262
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,604
as the salt will affect the taste      

263
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,742
and the shelf life of the sauce.             

264
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,545
next, they measure the protein content.       

265
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:50,014
fish protein breaks down during the fermentation process,            

266
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,351
releasing a compound called glutamate.        

267
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:57,222
glutamate increases the flavor intensity of the sauce.     

268
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,223
higher levels of protein give a tastier,         

269
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,960
higher-grade sauce.       

270
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,962
they also check the levels of histamine     

271
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,297
to make sure they comply     

272
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,099
with international food standards.         

273
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:12,370
high levels of histamine could indicate spoilage.     

274
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,906
they end with a ph test.     

275
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,575
good fish sauce is slightly acidic,       

276
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:22,313
and the ph value must remain within an acceptable range.   

277
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,784
people now use fish sauce not only in thai dishes,     

278
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,787
but also to flavor their own traditional foods.   

279
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,601
narrator:            
cappers are automated machines  

280
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,602
which apply caps on bottles   

281
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,672
that have been filled with a factory product --    

282
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,876
anything from shampoo to soft drinks.         

283
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,478
the closures the cappers apply include screw caps,    

284
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,014
push-down tops,         

285
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,184
and aluminum caps molded to the shape of the bottle neck.              

286
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:04,022
cappers come in different sizes              

287
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,757
to meet the product manufacturers'    

288
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,159
packaging requirements,     

289
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,229
from three-head machines that cap 40 bottles per minute,             

290
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:16,635
to 36-head machines that cap 1,200 bottles per minute.    

291
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,503
every capper is custom-designed         

292
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,705
for the product being packaged,            

293
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,641
so producers must supply the capper manufacturer     

294
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:28,112
with samples of their specific bottles and caps.              

295
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,181
the first step of the design phase       

296
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,783
is to paint the samples white  

297
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,587
so that engineers can scan them with a laser to produce     

298
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,789
a three-dimensional computer model.         

299
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,793
then the engineers use that virtual bottle and cap   

300
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,930
to design the machine's bottle-handling equipment.    

301
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,431
this refers to the components  

302
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,734
which transport the bottles through the machine       

303
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,671
as opposed to the components that apply the cap.       

304
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,873
this computer-guided water-jet cutter         

305
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:00,011
slices through a stainless-steel plate to make the bases     

306
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,013
that support the bottle-handling equipment  

307
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,216
on the capper from underneath.  

308
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,552
a computer-guided machining center         

309
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,688
shapes the complex bottle-handling components    

310
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,890
out of stainless-steel rods.   

311
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,029
the capper's bottle-capping components    

312
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,065
are machined the same way.    

313
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,437
every part undergoes a precision inspection.     

314
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,106
an engineer checks the dimensions with a device   

315
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,042
called a coordinate measuring machine.            

316
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,118
a computer-guided router cuts the plastic components   

317
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
of the bottle-handling equipment            

318
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,924
from a 19-millimeter-thick sheet of polyethylene.         

319
00:18:56,203 --> 00:19:00,138
meanwhile, an electrician wires the capper's control panel.   

320
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,673
it houses the components     

321
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,608
which regulate the machine's speed,       

322
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,543
as well as the computer that controls          

323
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,546
all the machine's functions.   

324
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,415
the machine has sensors that detect the presence of a bottle             

325
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:14,218
and cap at the capping head.   

326
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,489
these sensors are wired to the computer.         

327
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,559
other workers assemble the production-line conveyor belt  

328
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:26,497
that ferries bottles into and out of the capper.   

329
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,766
the belt is comprised of plastic links         

330
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,669
connected with pins.       

331
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,109
to begin assembling the machine,            

332
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,311
workers attach the three capping heads     

333
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,247
to the overhead carousel.    

334
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,116
then they install a capping chuck in each head.  

335
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,118
the chuck picks up a cap.    

336
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,457
then the capping head rotates to screw the cap on the bottle.             

337
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,725
a computer-guided engraver    

338
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,328
labels the capper's infeed star wheel --       

339
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,266
a disc with pockets that guide the bottles into the machine.  

340
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,068
workers highlight the engraving with paint     

341
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,403
and inset a colored disc     

342
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,539
indicating the specific bottle size     

343
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,608
the star wheel is designed to run.       

344
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,076
they repeat these steps     

345
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,146
with the machine's two other star wheels --     

346
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,413
one in the center of the machine             

347
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,550
that moves the bottles under the capping heads     

348
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,285
and another that transfers the bottles           

349
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,287
to the machine's exit.      

350
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,625
workers manually assemble each star wheel.         

351
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,827
they verify the pocket size...  

352
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,030
then, on the center star wheel only,         

353
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,699
bolt a stainless-steel reinforcement layer       

354
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,901
and line the pockets with a rubber material      

355
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,937
that grips bottles.       

356
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,841
after installing the metal support bases on the capper,   

357
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,444
they mount           
the corresponding star wheels.  

358
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,181
the center star wheel and base have to be made in halves    

359
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:54,318
to fit around the machine's central shaft.   

360
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,788
workers install the center guide.        

361
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,256
the bottles travel in the path  

362
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,392
between the wheels and the guide.          

363
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,795
next, workers install a restraint belt         

364
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,396
made of the same rubber material            

365
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:09,533
that lines the center star wheel pockets.       

366
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,001
the belt and pocket prevent the bottle        

367
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:16,207
from spinning as the capping head screws on the cap.     

368
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:20,211
no capper leaves the factory without a test run.       

369
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,613
before running the machine normally,      

370
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,415
workers run it at low speed to check      

371
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,751
that the components are properly aligned       

372
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,555
and the movements correctly timed.         

373
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,291
the infeed star wheel receiving the bottles      

374
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,293
transfers them to the center star wheel     

375
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,562
under the capping heads.     

376
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:41,833
the capped bottles then transfer to the discharge star wheel,   

377
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,868
which guides them to the conveyor belt       

378
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,870
leading to the labeling machine.
