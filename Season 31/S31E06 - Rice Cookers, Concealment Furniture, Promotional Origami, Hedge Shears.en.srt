on the blade's stem.      

309
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,737
the rubber will cushion the force of the impact created

310
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,440
as the shear blades come together.

another technician joins the blades

with a pivot bolt and nut.   

313

if needed, they adjust the interface   

320
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,838
by bending back the blades.  

321
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,373
this tweaking can be critical 

322
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,776
to the functioning of the hedge shears.      

323

onto the tangs.        

326

an inspector tests the telescoping action     

327
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:58,997

the tips of the hedge shears  

337

are dipped in an anti-rust solution
