      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,586
 narrator: in the 21st century, 

4
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,723
    there's more than one way   
  to chase down a perpetrator.  

5
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,325
  the electric stand-up vehicle 

6
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:02,594
  goes where traditional police 
   and security cars can't --   

7
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,931
        sidewalks, parks,       
 shopping malls, even airports. 

8
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,801
       the officer stands       
     for better visibility.     

9
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,837
         for a suspect,         
  there may be nowhere to run.  

10
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,342
   this electric three-wheeler  

11
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,944
       is the latest thing      
       on the police beat.      

12
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,481
 not only can it travel in areas
 that are inaccessible to cars, 

13
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,417
 but its environmental footprint

14
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,885
           is lighter           
 than a regular police cruiser. 

15
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,087
      it's energy efficient     

16
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,389
        and it generates        
      no local pollutants.      

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,094
        production starts       
    with the vehicle's frame.   

18
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,030
      an employee assembles     
      the tube steel parts      

19
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,565
    and welds them together.    

20
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,702
    the next worker attaches    

21
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,171
          the vehicle's         
       control-board panel      

22
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,307
      to the welded frame.      

23
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,177
  he inserts the steering shaft 
         into the column        

24
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:54,647
   and slides a plastic collar  
  onto the bottom of the shaft. 

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,383
      he secures the collar     
           with screws          

26
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,419
          and tightens          
    the adjustment mechanism.   

27
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,793
  he installs the second collar 
        on the upper part       

28
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,395
     of the steering shaft.     

29
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:12,465
         the two collars        
    will stabilize the shaft    

30
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,735
    to keep the front wheel     
    of the vehicle straight.    

31
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:19,538
            he plugs            
    the electric motor cable    

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,273
     into the control panel.    

33
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:28,748
next, another member of the team

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,150
     sprays a uniform layer     
          of a gel coat         

35
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,086
      onto a two-part mold      
     of the vehicle chassis.    

36
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,355
        the gel will act        
       as a release agent       

37
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,890
    for the finished chassis.   

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,628
      they make the chassis     
        from fiberglass.        

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,065
       he sprays it evenly      
 into the crevices of the molds.

40
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,837
   he presses out air bubbles   
     using a rubber roller.     

41
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,976
      the fiberglass dries      
         and solidifies,        

42
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,178
  taking the shape of the mold. 

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,847
     the surface is smooth,     

44
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,517
 but there are some ragged bits 
        around the edges.       

45
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,019
        those are sanded.       

46
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:13,859
       he cuts out a slot       
in the upper part of the chassis

47
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,494
   for a police warning light.  

48
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:24,804
finally, the chassis gets a coat
of automotive-grade white paint.

49
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,608
he paints the wheel wells black,

50
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,479
         and with that,         
 the outer chassis is complete. 

51
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,214
    there's an interior panel   

52
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,616
          and it's made         
       of fiberglass, too.      

53
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,752
 a member of the team mounts it 

54
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,688
          to the inside         
  of the steel-frame assembly.  

55
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,692
 he then secures the outer panel
      to the vehicle frame.     

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,897
          this electric         
  three-wheel vehicle is ready  

57
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,967
     for the rear-wheel hubs    
        and brake rotors.       

58
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,240
    he clamps brake calipers    
         to the rotors.         

59
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,779
      the wheels are next.      

60
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,448
          the rear ones         
     are motorcycle wheels.     

61
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,092
         for the front,         
   they use a golf-cart wheel.  

62
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,799
      he equips the wheel       
      with a pulley system      

63
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,868
       to transfer energy       
         from the motor.        

64
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,671
           he installs          
     the 1-horsepower motor     

65
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,473
 and attaches the pulley to it. 

66
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,876
      the motor is the size     
       of a lunch bucket,       

67
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:41,213
  but can pull up to 450 pounds 
  and reach 20 miles per hour.  

68
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:46,085
 he hooks up the front wheel to 
testing equipment and powers up.

69
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,221
          it evaluates          
   the motor speed and noise.   

70
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:53,225
it also detects any undue strain
       or wheel wobbling.       

71
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:00,065
            satisfied           
 with the front-wheel assembly, 

72
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,168
 he installs it on the vehicle. 

73
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:10,842
   he wires, and then attaches  
 the throttle and brake control 

74
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,211
        to the handlebar.       

75
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,719
      they carpet the floor     
  with non-slip rubberized foam 

76
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,856
         and then slide         
 the two rechargeable batteries 

77
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,525
      into their respective     
          compartments.         

78
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,127
         the charge time        
     is three to four hours.    

79
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,730
     next, this grab handle     
        gives the driver        

80
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,599
 something extra to hang on to. 

81
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,602
     they equip the vehicle     
       with warning lights      

82
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:39,271
   and a high-beam headlight.   

83
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,806
  this electric patrol vehicle  

84
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,942
       has been six hours       
         in the making,         

85
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,812
 and it's now ready for a spin. 

86
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,198
            narrator:           
nowadays, you don't have to wait

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,267
     for your favorite fruit    
        to be in season.        

88
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,668
    you can buy it year-round   

89
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,338
     in the freezer section     
   of your local supermarket.   

90
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,940
          frozen fruit          
    is useful to have on hand   

91
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,074
           for baking,          

92
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,544
     for making fruit salads    
          or smoothies,         

93
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,012
      to use as a topping,      

94
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:21,981
  or to eat as a healthy snack. 

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,487
      timing is everything.     

96
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:31,090
   for example, strawberries,   
        when sold fresh,        

97
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,425
           are picked           
    well before they're ripe    

98
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,361
       so they won't spoil      
  before reaching store shelves 

99
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,763
    as much as a week later.    

100
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,632
       but if the berries       
  are for the freezer section,  

101
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,834
        they're harvested       
        when fully ripe.        

102
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,704
    that state of perfection    
     will be frozen in time     

103
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,772
        within 36 hours.        

104
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,374
          farm workers          
    pick the berries by hand    

105
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,576
          and trim them         
       right in the field       

106
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,480
       with one swipe over      
 a sharp stainless-steel blade. 

107
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,721
within 90 minutes of harvesting,

108
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,656
        the strawberries        
        are on their way        

109
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,326
      by refrigerated truck     
 to the nearby processing plant 

110
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,962
     for cleaning, sorting,     
       and quick freezing.      

111
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,866
           first stop           
     on the processing line,    

112
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,737
      a bath in fresh water     
      to remove field dirt.     

113
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,840
   this wheel gently submerges  
     every last strawberry.     

114
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,779
         then, a shower         
      of clean rinse water.     

115
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,884
    followed by a spray rinse   
  with highly-chlorinated water 

116
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,753
    to sanitize the berries.    

117
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:40,358
    next, eagle-eyed workers    
      pick out and discard      

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,894
           any bruised          
     or under-ripe berries.     

119
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:47,166
 the rest receive a final rinse 
en route to the freezing tunnel.

120
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:52,103
         temperature --         
     -34 degrees fahrenheit.    

121
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,173
        the cooling coils       
    contain liquid ammonia --   

122
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:59,978
   a refrigerant commonly used  
 for industrial-scale freezing. 

123
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,246
       inside the tunnel,       

124
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,115
 where the frigid air circulates
         at high speed,         

125
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,718
       the berries freeze       
      in about 20 minutes.      

126
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,722
 upon exiting, they ride through
       a sorting machine.       

127
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:12,724
       the smaller berries      
   drop through narrower gaps   

128
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,793
       between the rollers      
          near the top,         

129
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,063
      the medium-size ones      
through wider gaps partway down,

130
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,866
      while the larger ones     
     continue to the bottom.    

131
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:24,403
         these peaches,         
   also handpicked when ripe,   

132
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:28,807
  go through the same cleaning  
  process as the strawberries.  

133
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,110
  first a bath, then a shower.  

134
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:36,147
     then a sanitizing rinse    
     with chlorinated water.    

135
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,284
          after workers         
     pick out leaves, twigs,    

136
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,686
and any less-than-perfect fruit,

137
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,157
     a sorting machine sorts    
     the peaches by size --     

138
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,225
   small, medium, and large --  

139
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:50,695
        sending each size       
  to a separate conveyor belt.  

140
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,698
            each belt           
    leads to a different line   

141
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,833
       of stainless-steel       
       pitting machines,        

142
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,236
     adjusted for the size      
     of the incoming fruit.     

143
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:06,311
       first, the machine       
  places the peaches stem-down. 

144
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:11,583
  next, a knife cuts the peach  
 in half along its natural line.

145
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:15,653
      then mechanical jaws      
      grab the stone inside     

146
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,457
   and dislodge it by twisting  
   the two halves of the peach  

147
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,526
     in opposite directions.    

148
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,128
      each machine can pit      
     90 peaches per minute,     

149
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,398
     so the only way to see     
 that action is in slow motion. 

150
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,207
 all the peach halves and stones
    coming out of the pitters   

151
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,476
             tumble             
   onto a vibrating conveyor.   

152
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,278
           the stones           
     fall through the holes     

153
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,480
       while the peaches,       
     larger than the holes,     

154
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,582
          continue on.          

155
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,486
      a conveyor flips them     
           cut-side up          

156
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,758
   so that workers can inspect  
 and remove any stone fragments.

157
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:02,300
  the next conveyor gradually   
  lines them up in single file  

158
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,703
 to enter the slicing machines. 

159
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:09,107
 the slicer blades cut each half
    into four to six pieces,    

160
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,244
    depending on what format    
      the customer ordered.     

161
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,617
         then the slices        
  go into the freezing tunnel.  

162
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,253
          peach slices          
      take slightly longer      

163
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,322
 than strawberries to freeze -- 
        about 25 minutes.       

164
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,192
   to prevent the frozen fruit  
        from defrosting,        

165
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,994
       the air temperature      
      in the packaging area     

166
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,931
           is a frigid          
     39 degrees fahrenheit.     

167
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:37,468
 an automated scales weighs out 
    the per-package quantity,   

168
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,873
     then drops the berries     
       into a retail bag.       

169
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,145
           the machine          
     then heat seals the bag    

170
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,747
         and deposits it        
     on the final conveyor,     

171
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,417
           which goes           
  to the pre-shipping freezer.  

172
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,888
   only 15 minutes have passed  
   since the fruit was frozen,  

173
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,824
        and just 24 hours       
   since it was field picked.   

174
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,909
  narrator: liquid refreshment  
can leave its mark on the table.

175
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,644
      coasters come between     
       the glass and that.      

176
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,447
     but two centuries ago,     
   coasters were mainly placed  

177
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,584
     on the rim of the glass    
       to keep out flies.       

178
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:28,654
          made of felt,         
they unfortunately spread germs,

179
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,989
    so the cardboard coaster    
          was invented          

180
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,458
       to improve hygiene       
       on the pub scene.        

181
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:39,264
        beverage coasters       
        protect the table       

182
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,399
 and are also a marketing tool. 

183
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,335
 raise the glass, and you'll see
    advertising catchphrases    

184
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,338
    and promotional graphics.   

185
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,475
    in fact, some bar hoppers   
    consider coasters pub art   

186
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,144
and accumulate vast collections.

187
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,880
           production           
   at this facility in germany  

188
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,616
    starts with spruce wood.    

189
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,886
    in this case, it's from     
    the black forest nearby.    

190
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,825
 they spray the wood with water 
      to moisten the bark.      

191
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:09,761
    then it's into a tumbler    
   that tosses the wood logs.   

192
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:14,233
      as they knock against     
 each other, the bark peels off.

193
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:18,370
       the de-barked wood       
exits onto a conveyor with slots

194
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:21,807
to correctly orient it for entry
     into a massive grinder.    

195
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,780
             inside,            
   chains press the wood logs   

196
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,384
   against the grinding stone,  
   shredding them into chips.   

197
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,986
           water flows          
     over the grinding stone    

198
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,522
           to cool it           
    and carry away the chips,   

199
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,524
which are then mixed into a mash

200
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,126
    that has a porridge-like    
          consistency.          

201
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,529
      it's pure wood pulp.      

202
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,265
  they now add leftover product 

203
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,201
   from previous beer-coaster   
     production to the pulp.    

204
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,802
    this will be used to make   

205
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,305
        the middle layer        
      of the beer coasters.     

206
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,945
finally, they mix residual paper
      from the manufacturer     

207
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,348
   of magazines and envelopes   
           with water.          

208
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,617
          this creates          
     a lighter-colored pulp.    

209
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,353
         it will be used        
   for the printable surfaces   

210
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,755
      of the beer coaster.      

211
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:17,095
 they spray the pulp onto a mesh
   that drains water from it.   

212
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,431
      the fibrous wood core     
     goes between the layers    

213
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,366
      of the lighter pulp.      

214
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,504
       spigots apply a mix      
    of wheat starch and water   

215
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,042
       that acts as a glue      
       between the layers.      

216
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,511
   off the mesh conveyors now,  

217
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:34,379
         the pulp board         
    travels between cylinders   

218
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,715
 that squeeze out the moisture. 

219
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,250
  more heated cylinders dry it. 

220
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:43,054
    knives now cut the board    
      into large rectangles     

221
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:48,660
 sized for the coaster-printing 
     and cutting machinery.     

222
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:53,598
    this specialty cardboard    
  is known as wood-pulp board.  

223
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,802
        it's lightweight        
      yet highly absorbent.     

224
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,003
         next it's over         
   to the printing department   

225
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,541
 to put the beer-coaster artwork
     on the wood-pulp board.    

226
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,342
   they use offset printing --  

227
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,678
     a process that involves    
    more revolving cylinders.   

228
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,682
   color cylinders pick up ink  
         and transfer it        

229
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,417
   to the printing cylinders.   

230
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,887
   from there, the image goes   
  to a rubber-wrapped cylinder  

231
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,423
       that then prints it      
        onto the sheets.        

232
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,429
 a print specialist scrutinizes 
     the print job close up     

233
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,431
    with a magnifying glass.    

234
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,367
 he checks the color and clarity
          of the images         

235
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,702
    and confirms that they're   
      correctly positioned      

236
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,770
          on the sheet.         

237
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,908
    the borders of the images   
          must line up          

238
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,212
     with the grid of blades    
  on the die-cutting machinery. 

239
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,183
        if the alignment        
      is even slightly off,     

240
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,853
   every coaster on the sheet   
         would be ruined        

241
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:51,189
        as the die cutter       
    punches out the coasters,   

242
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,258
  dozens of them in one swoop.  

243
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,328
       the coasters end up      
       over little chutes,      

244
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,463
 and pushers give them a nudge. 

245
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,867
    they fall down the chutes   
         and land neatly        

246
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,769
       on a pallet below.       

247
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,404
     the coasters stack up,     

248
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,407
  and when there are 100 or so  
          in each pile,         

249
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,677
  they're ready for packaging.  

250
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,013
     machinery shrink wraps     
           the stacks,          

251
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,549
        and they're ready       
     for the thirsty masses.    

252
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,152
          this factory          
     can produce and package    

253
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:23,621
    10 million offset-printed   
    beer coasters every day,    

254
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,858
 so there should be no shortage 
        at cocktail hour.       

255
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:32,164
    they also print coasters    
using a centuries-old technology

256
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,099
      known as letterpress.     

257
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,237
    blank coasters drop down    
        into the machine.       

258
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:43,508
  a rolling wheel presses each  
  coaster against an ink plate. 

259
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,244
          it's a system         
   that both prints the image   

260
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,581
         and embosses it        
        on the cardboard.       

261
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,684
        it's a difference       
   you can both see and feel.   

262
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,922
     letterpress production     
  is lower volume than offset,  

263
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,459
           generating           
    100,000 coasters per day.   

264
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,796
    for coasters, the design    
   possibilities are endless.   

265
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,600
  just raise a glass and enjoy. 

266
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,352
     narrator: a door handle    
     is a decorative detail     

267
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,222
  that delivers tremendous bang 
          for the buck.         

268
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,690
     it's quite inexpensive,    

269
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,627
     yet through its design,    
      material, and finish,     

270
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,028
      contributes immensely     

271
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,364
      to defining the style     
           of a space,          

272
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,600
        from traditional        
        to ultra modern.        

273
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,306
 these hand-forged iron handles 

274
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,043
    open the door to a rustic   
     english country decor.     

275
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,379
while the handle itself is iron,

276
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,248
     the backplate behind it    
            is steel.           

277
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,118
 a computer-guided water machine
       cuts the backplate       

278
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,653
   out of a 3-millimeter-thick  
          steel sheet.          

279
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,856
           the machine          
    slices through the steel    

280
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,591
    not with a blade or saw,    

281
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:10,194
     but with a concentrated    
   high-pressure jet of water.  

282
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,465
the water contains a tiny amount
    of a super-fine abrasive    

283
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,735
   and cuts through the steel   
  with 2,000 times the pressure 

284
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,402
         of a car tire.         

285
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,406
    the jet cuts the contour    
        of the backplate,       

286
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:25,143
     then holes for the key,    
 the mechanism, and the screws, 

287
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,645
      which affix the plate     
          to the door.          

288
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:31,082
 next, with a beveling machine, 
      they cut a neat angle     

289
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,884
        on all four sides       
        of the backplate.       

290
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,220
  this smooths the sharp edges  

291
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,823
     and gives the backplate    
        a finished look.        

292
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,363
           meanwhile,           
   on a computer-guided lave,   

293
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,300
  a knife progressively shapes  
        a round steel bar       

294
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,770
     into the main component    
 of the door-handle mechanism --

295
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,071
        the inner barrel.       

296
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,112
the next tool bores a hole in it
    to receive the spindle --   

297
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,581
             a bolt             
   that runs through the door,  

298
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,851
     connecting the handles     
         on either side.        

299
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,452
       to make the handle,      

300
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,255
      a blacksmith heats up     
           an iron bar          

301
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,059
    in the 1,600-degree heat    
           of a forge           

302
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,227
         and hammers it         
       to a tapered point.      

303
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,868
   then he repeatedly reheats   
       and works the iron,      

304
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,403
     hammering it some more     

305
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,540
         and bending it         
  against a steel forming jig.  

306
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,274
         with each bend,        

307
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,345
     the handle comes closer    
       to the final shape.      

308
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
       once the blacksmith      
     has completed his work     

309
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,229
 and the iron handle has cooled,

310
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,032
        they drill a hole       
    to receive the mechanism.   

311
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,633
     then with another tool,    

312
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,169
      they angle the edges      
          of the hole.          

313
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,105
 this increases the surface area

314
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:03,041
     to which they now weld     
  the mechanism's inner barrel. 

315
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:06,444
   the larger the welded area,  
     the stronger the weld.     

316
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,780
        the welder places       
         both components        

317
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:12,850
      in a positioning jig      
  to get the proper alignment,  

318
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:15,420
    then welds them together.   

319
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,924
     he removes the assembly    
          from the jig,         

320
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,394
            flips it,           
 and welds from the other side. 

321
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:30,434
 they grind the weld lines flat,
  rendering them unnoticeable.  

322
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,738
  if the handle is supposed to  
     have a hammered finish,    

323
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,141
    this is when they create    
          that texture          

324
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:39,477
 with, you guessed it, a hammer.

325
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,212
          now they heat         
       the handle assembly      

326
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,214
     and the steel backplate    
          in the forge,         

327
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:46,217
          then dip them         
      in a vat of beeswax.      

328
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:50,688
   this protects against rust   
       when used indoors.       

329
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,424
    with the main components    
           now ready,           

330
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,561
    final assembly can begin,   
  starting with the mechanism.  

331
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,430
    they slip a nylon washer,   
       then a steel spring      

332
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,832
     over the inner barrel.     

333
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:06,838
   next, they grease the outer  
   barrel made of forged iron   

334
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,908
          and place it          
     over the inner barrel.     

335
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,910
      the washer in between     
 the barrels eliminates friction

336
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,979
         when they move         
       against each other.      

337
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:19,918
    this prevents the barrel    
 from wearing out and squeaking.

338
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,454
    they install a tab washer   
  made of nickel-plated steel.  

339
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,724
       this tab restricts       
      the barrel's rotation     

340
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,061
       so that it doesn't       
 simply spin around and around. 

341
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,797
       this high-strength       
    steel locking clip holds    

342
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,331
   the inner and outer barrels  

343
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,935
  and that important tab washer 
            in place.           

344
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
       now that the handle      
   and mechanism are complete,  

345
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:46,210
  all that remains is to align  
       backplate to handle      

346
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,647
    and secure it in position   
          with screws.          

347
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,286
  each retail package contains  

348
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,688
           two handles          
      and two backplates --     

349
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,158
 one for each side of the door. 

350
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,693
        also in the box,        
        the steel spindle       

351
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,630
   that goes through the door,  
     connecting the barrels     

352
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,699
    so that the handles turn    
            in unison           

353
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,068
      to retract the latch      
       and open the door.       

354
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,107
      while their mechanics     
      are hidden from view,     

355
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,911
  these hand-forged handles are 
  certainly a sight to be seen. 

356
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,656
    if you have any comments
