00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,690
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,160
             cars...            

5
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,961
        grocery carts...        

6
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,564
rapid tooling and prototyping...

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,867
     and collectible coins.     

8
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,037
     the automotive industry    

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,773
    has seen a lot of changes   
        in recent years.        

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,042
    more and more robots are    
        replacing workers       

11
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,444
      on the assembly line,     

12
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,179
          and it isn't          
      just cars and trucks      

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,981
  coming off the line anymore.  

14
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:52,718
     today's hot wheels are     
sport-utility vehicles and vans.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,256
    in the plant's body shop,   

16
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,927
 they begin by putting together 
 the front structure of the van.

17
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,731
  it's made up of the radiator  
    support, two side rails,    

18
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,000
     and clips on the front     
       of those side rails      

19
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,334
    for the bumper structure.   

20
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,203
          then they put         
      this front structure      

21
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,339
       onto the automated       
        production line.        

22
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,009
  meanwhile, robots weld what's 
  known as the ladder assembly. 

23
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,880
 it's the backbone that supports
 the floor and sides of the van.

24
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,882
it contains, among other things,

25
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,885
           the pockets          
    that will hold the seats.   

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,643
         now the robots         
  take the front-end structure  

27
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,314
     and the ladder assembly    
     and weld them together.    

28
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,069
        elsewhere, robots       
     work on the body panel     

29
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,405
     for the passenger side     
           of the van.          

30
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,673
        the entire panel        

31
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,610
      is made of one piece      
      of galvanized steel.      

32
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,345
 the robots weld reinforcements 
         onto the panel         

33
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,881
    so they can later attach    
       interior finishing       

34
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,350
      and other components.     

35
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,287
  a transfer device swoops down 

36
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,090
     and transfers the panel    
      to the next station.      

37
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,828
  the driver's side body panel, 
coming off another welding line,

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,530
      is headed there, too.     

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,313
      at the next station,      

40
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,449
  robots have already installed 
 an underbody with a floor panel

41
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,187
  on top of the ladder-assembly 
      unit we saw earlier.      

42
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,924
  now the robots weld the body  
  side panels to the underbody. 

43
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,795
they also weld inner wheel wells
   to the body's side panels.   

44
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,397
    then they weld on a roof.   

45
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,333
       the van then rolls       
 into the area of the body shop 

46
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,802
        called closures.        

47
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,205
    that's where they install   
    the lift gate, the hood,    

48
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,405
         and the doors.         

49
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,074
  an inspector checks the gaps  
        around the hood,        

50
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,477
    looks for dents and dings   
          in the body,          

51
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,880
    and makes sure the doors    
 are flush with the side panels.

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,950
       he marks any areas       
 that need repair or adjustments

53
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,752
       with removable ink.      

54
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,222
 the engines arrive at the plant
       already assembled.       

55
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,026
  workers just have to install  
  and adjust a few components.  

56
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,295
       meanwhile, the van       
    is off at the paint shop,   

57
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,897
    followed by the trim shop   

58
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:57,069
       for glass, handles,      
    and interior components.    

59
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,572
   in the chassis department,   

60
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,642
 the engine, transmission, rear 
 suspension, and brake assembly 

61
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,578
 are installed from underneath. 

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,714
 this part of the assembly line 
         has two tiers.         

63
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,485
      the van goes on top,      
  the components on the bottom. 

64
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,725
    the machines that install   
  the components have long pins 

65
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,662
       that fit into holes      
     in the van's underbody.    

66
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,598
  this positions the components 
         with precision.        

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,370
         workers hook up        
     the gas tank manually.     

68
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:42,280
   the seats arrive ready-made  
     from a nearby factory.     

69
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,016
  they simply clamp into place  
       in the seat pockets      

70
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,753
      that were welded onto     
  the ladder assembly earlier.  

71
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,891
  an automated machine attaches 
   the tire to the wheel rim.   

72
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,960
        then it inflates        
     and balances the tire.     

73
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,564
    workers mount the tires,    
   starting the nuts by hand,   

74
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,633
then tightening them with tools.

75
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,835
      now the van comes off     
           the carrier          

76
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:08,106
     and goes full weight on    
 its wheels for the first time. 

77
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,241
  workers start up the ignition 

78
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,778
         and run the van        
   through a series of tests.   

79
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,781
 it's taken the plant about 24  
 hours to produce this vehicle, 

80
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,719
  which will soon be on its way 
      to a car dealership.      

81
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,263
            narrator:           
geomatics is a high-tech science

82
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,332
  whose objective is to gather  
     geographic information,    

83
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,001
     then study and use it.     

84
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,937
     the tools of geomatics     
     range from cartography     

85
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,406
        to remote sensing       
      to satellite imaging.     

86
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,808
       we wouldn't be able      
    to study the environment    

87
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,144
     or monitor and develop     
     our natural resources      

88
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,213
     without geomatic data.     

89
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,088
   an oklahoma grocer invented  
     the first shopping cart    

90
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,024
          back in 1937.         

91
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,426
    he noticed his customers    
        stopped shopping        

92
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,429
     once their hand baskets    
   became too heavy to carry.   

93
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,533
      his basket on wheels      
   became a rollaway success.   

94
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,841
       this factory makes       
    about 50 different models   

95
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,042
       of shopping carts.       

96
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,446
  they're built with heavy-duty 
     steel and carbon wire.     

97
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,983
    a single cart is made up    
  of more than 150 wire pieces  

98
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,019
       of various lengths       
         and diameters.         

99
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,724
       automated machines       
         bend the wires         

100
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,994
       to form the carts'       
      numerous components.      

101
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,002
   to make the cart's basket,   

102
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,738
      a worker uses a guide     
       called a jig loader      

103
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,542
      to line up the wires      
      in a mesh formation.      

104
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:59,251
  then a machine automatically  
    spot-welds them together.   

105
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,838
        the next machine        
   applies 20 tons of pressure  

106
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,009
        to bend the wires       
      into a basket shape.      

107
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,762
     a robot welds the sides    
         of the basket.         

108
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:50,035
     a worker then trims off    
        the excess wire.        

109
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,679
      an automated machine      
      bends a piece of wire     

110
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,348
       to form the handle       
      of the shopping cart.     

111
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,025
they make the frame for the base
of the cart, called the chassis,

112
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,329
      out of one thick tube     
      that's 13 feet long.      

113
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,311
    a robot welds the chassis   

114
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,715
        using wire melted       
    by an electrical current.   

115
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,084
          this creates          
      a very strong joint.      

116
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,789
    a die machine punches out   
casters that'll hold the wheels.

117
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,593
 they're made of thick steel for
 extra strength and durability. 

118
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,267
   they spot-weld the casters   
         to the chassis.        

119
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,207
      they clean the cart's     
        metal components        

120
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,976
   in a bath of soap and acid.  

121
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,416
   they electroplate the metal  
          with nickel,          

122
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,519
        then with chrome        
      as a finishing coat.      

123
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,561
        it's finally time       
   for the cart to take shape.  

124
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,997
      they rivet the wheels     
        to the chassis...       

125
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,904
...then install the bottom rack.

126
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,949
     the basket comes next.     

127
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:01,266
     they print the warnings    
      on the plastic panel      

128
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,535
 for the collapsible baby seat. 

129
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,877
   then the seat goes on along  
with the plastic corner bumpers.

130
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,847
   they print the store's name  
     on the handle inserts.     

131
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,154
    the handle goes on last.    

132
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:27,024
  after some final adjustments  
  and a quality control check,  

133
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:32,097
 the newly minted shopping cart 
        is ready to roll.       

134
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,046
  narrator: every machine, from 
your vacuum cleaner to your car,

135
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,248
is made up of a series of parts.

136
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,052
    those parts are designed    
    by specialized companies.   

137
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,920
  they first build a prototype, 

138
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:00,024
  then make the molds or tools  
needed to manufacture the parts.

139
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,528
   they design the part in 3-d  
         on a computer.         

140
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,531
          the computer          
    then guides the machines    

141
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,867
  that construct the prototype. 

142
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,336
       one method divides       
         the 3-d drawing        

143
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,271
   into cross-sectional layers  

144
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,740
     just a few thousandths     
        of an inch thick.       

145
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,942
    it feeds this information   
           to a laser           

146
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,410
    that's directed at a tray   

147
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,012
  filled with a light-sensitive 
          liquid resin.         

148
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,415
        the laser's light       
        hardens the resin       

149
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,152
    in the shape of the part    
         layer by layer,        

150
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,621
     eventually constructing    
         the prototype.         

151
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:33,358
    they rotate the prototype   
     under ultraviolet light    

152
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
         for a few hours        
       to cure the resin.       

153
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,363
    then they polish or paint   
          the prototype         

154
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,100
  according to the requirements 
         of the design.         

155
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,837
   another prototyping method   
     works much the same way    

156
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,574
    but uses a fine, powdered   
    plastic instead of resin.   

157
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,111
  the computer guides the laser 
       to melt the powder       

158
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,681
    in the shape of the part,   
      again layer by layer.     

159
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,321
          they extract          
     the hardened prototype     

160
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,990
    from the unmelted powder.   

161
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,260
  a third method of prototyping 
   doesn't use a laser at all.  

162
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,731
   the computer simply guides   
machinery to carve the prototype

163
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,534
     out of a hard material     
    such as a wood composite.   

164
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,936
   once a prototype is ready,   

165
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,472
    they use it to construct    
       a model of the part      

166
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,341
  out of a very durable resin.  

167
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,077
     they'll use that model     
         to make a mold,        

168
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,014
   then they'll use that mold   
 to cast the part out of metal. 

169
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,885
      the resin model dries     
at room temperature in 24 hours.

170
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:38,289
  its surface must be smooth or 
else the mold will have defects.

171
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,028
      they attach channels      

172
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,099
that will guide the molten metal
         into the mold.         

173
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,637
next, they fill the model with a
mix of sand and a binding agent.

174
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,311
  they smooth out the surface,  

175
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,514
         then number it         
     for tracking purposes.     

176
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,050
          the sand mix          
     takes about 15 minutes     

177
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,652
     to harden into a mold.     

178
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,321
          now they can          
     finally cast the part.     

179
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,190
         they carefully         
    pour in the molten medal,   

180
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,925
    in this case, magnesium,    

181
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,595
        heat it to about        
    1,300-degrees fahrenheit.   

182
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,597
  they block the hole with sand 

183
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:23,868
      to prevent the metal      
    from reacting to the air.   

184
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,938
      the metal takes about     
   10 to 20 minutes to harden,  

185
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,273
      depending on the size     
          of the mold.          

186
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,477
    they crack the mold open    
    on a vibrating conveyer.    

187
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,346
     they use a plaster mold    
          to cast parts         

188
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,349
          that require          
    a better surface finish.    

189
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,885
     workers position a box     
      around the prototype      

190
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,253
     to contain the plaster.    

191
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,378
   the mold goes into an oven   
at about 570-degrees fahrenheit.

192
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,447
            it takes            
     48 to 72 hours to cure,    

193
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,985
       but it's not ready       
      for casting just yet.     

194
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,520
  workers first have to pierce  
        some holes in it        

195
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,922
    to let all the air escape   

196
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,858
     or the metal won't flow    
     into all the crevices.     

197
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,395
 and they have to put in filters
     to keep out impurities.    

198
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,999
    they strap the two halves   
  of the plaster mold together, 

199
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,568
securing them with metal screws.

200
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:40,478
        workers carefully       
    pour in molten magnesium,   

201
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,750
 using a special gas to prevent 
 the metal from catching fire.  

202
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:50,220
        again, they seal        
     the opening with sand.     

203
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:55,093
it takes the metal anywhere from
 20 minutes to an hour to cool. 

204
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:59,230
then they break open the plaster
    to remove the metal part.   

205
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,165
    they cut off the channels   

206
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,168
          through which         
    they poured in the metal    

207
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,572
       and polish the part      
   using grinders and sanders.  

208
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,907
       then they paint it       

209
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,443
   using special spray paint    
   that adheres to magnesium.   

210
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,446
  the part is finally finished. 

211
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,048
     it takes several weeks     

212
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,118
      to prototype and tool     
      metal machine parts.      

213
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,519
    when you think about it,    

214
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,788
        even the machine        
      that make these parts     

215
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,326
   are made of parts that were  
    created with this method.   

216
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,874
            narrator:           
 the first people to make coins 

217
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:48,746
        were the lydians        
    in asia minor in 640 b.c.   

218
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,348
      about 40 years later,     

219
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,350
       the concept spread       
       to ancient greece,       

220
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,220
   where coins often featured   
            an owl --           

221
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,824
           the symbol           
     of the goddess athena.     

222
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,959
        around 500 b.c.,        

223
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,696
 the chinese invented coins made
  of cheap metals like copper,  

224
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,232
   instead of gold and silver.  

225
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,702
     today's currency coins     
    are still made of copper,   

226
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,539
        nickel, and other       
     inexpensive materials.     

227
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,783
 the mint manufactures collector
   coins using sterling silver  

228
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,787
 as well as sterling scraps left
  over from making other coins. 

229
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,089
         the silver goes        
     into a casting furnace     

230
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,459
  at 2,100 degrees fahrenheit.  

231
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,063
    the melted silver is cast   
      into a continuous bar     

232
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,266
     about 1 1/2 inches high    
        by 5 inches wide.       

233
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:46,337
  a machine cuts the continuous 
    bar into individual bars    

234
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,072
      about 30 inches long.     

235
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,544
each bar goes into what's called
       the roughing mill.       

236
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,481
  the mill's two rollers squash 
          the bar flat,         

237
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,617
  using up to 9 tons of force.  

238
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,821
  it takes up to a dozen passes 
       to flatten the bar       

239
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,691
          into a strip          
    just half an inch thick.    

240
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,293
        a machine called        
       the finishing mill       

241
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,696
  thins the strip out even more 

242
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,699
    to what will be the final   
     thickness of the coin,     

243
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,969
    anywhere from 3/100ths of   
 an inch to 2/10ths of an inch, 

244
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,639
 depending on the denomination. 

245
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,376
   next, the blanking machine   
     stamps out blank coins.    

246
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,444
  the silver that's left over,  
          called sisel,         

247
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,513
            goes back           
    into the casting furnace,   

248
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,517
     where it's melted down     
   into fresh bars of silver.   

249
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,988
  the next stop for the blanks  
     is the rimming machine,    

250
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,591
  whose spinning wheel presses  
         a raised edge,         

251
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,261
      or rim, on each one.      

252
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,396
  the blanks then go into a tub 
       filled with water,       

253
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,000
       cleaning solutions,      
        and steel beads.        

254
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,934
          the beads act         
      as an abrasive agent,     

255
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,271
     smoothing and polishing    
           the blanks.          

256
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,406
    after a 20-minute cycle,    

257
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,077
  they empty the tub's contents 
          into a sifter         

258
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,546
     to separate the blanks     
         from the beads.        

259
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,148
     workers then towel dry     
       the blanks by hand.      

260
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,418
   this ensures there will be   
  no water stains on the coins. 

261
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,687
           throughout           
    the coin-making process,    

262
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,623
    as the silver is worked,    
      it becomes brittle --     

263
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,093
 so brittle that it could easily
       break when struck.       

264
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,895
  that's why at several stages  

265
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:22,766
 the metal goes through an oven 
  called an annealing furnace.  

266
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,303
    the coin design comprises   
     artwork or a photograph    

267
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,106
    or a combination of both.   

268
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,109
     this coin will feature     
 a photograph of queen elizabeth

269
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,645
 provided by buckingham palace. 

270
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,381
         the artist uses        
       a computer program       

271
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,383
      to design a collage       
      of various elements.      

272
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:43,654
   once mint officials approve  
        the final design,       

273
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,525
    the process of engraving    
           can begin.           

274
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:52,263
 they take a plaster disk that's
   10 1/2 inches in diameter.   

275
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,132
       the computer guides      
      the engraving machine     

276
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,002
   to turn the one-dimensional  
         computer design        

277
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:01,739
into a three-dimensional version
        in rough detail.        

278
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,209
  this creates a plaster model  
 of the design in the negative. 

279
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:09,146
   they now use this negative   
   to cast a plaster positive.  

280
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,683
     an artist then enhances    
       the detail by hand.      

281
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,954
   once that's done, they cast  
    a negative plaster mold.    

282
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,224
    from that, they then cast   
        a positive mold,        

283
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,226
      this time in rubber.      

284
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,961
        from the rubber,        

285
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,498
    they cast a negative mold   
    out of hard, black epoxy.   

286
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,369
 they mount the epoxy model on  
 a machine called a pantograph, 

287
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,839
      which is essentially      
      a reducing machine.       

288
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,841
       it traces the model      

289
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,376
 and cuts a version 1 1/2 times 
        smaller in brass.       

290
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,313
     this reduction process     
         takes 36 hours.        

291
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,050
        then an engraver        
      takes the brass model     

292
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,986
    and fine-tunes the design   
       under a microscope.      

293
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,323
   at this stage, the engraver  
    also adds the lettering,    

294
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,125
        noting the year,        
        the denomination,       

295
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,661
    and the country of issue.   

296
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,064
       then comes another       
   36-hour reduction process.   

297
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,267
  they reduce this brass model  
  to 1 1/2 half times its size  

298
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,070
     to create what's called    
           a matrix --          

299
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,672
      a negative model made     
       of high-grade steel      

300
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,341
      that's the final size     
          of the coin.          

301
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,412
   then they strike the matrix  
      onto a block of steel     

302
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,614
    which creates a positive    
         called a punch.        

303
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,618
   then they strike the punch   
    onto another steel block    

304
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,488
      to create a negative      
          called a die.         

305
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,958
the coins are made one at a time
       in the coin press.       

306
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,630
  there are two dies per coin,  
       one for each side,       

307
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,832
   positioned above and below   
           the blank.           

308
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,302
   they strike simultaneously,  
       not once but twice,      

309
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,771
            to create           
   a high-quality impression.   

310
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,642
 in contrast, circulation coins 
      are struck just once      

311
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,176
     on high-speed machines     

312
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,647
 that make several hundred coins
           per minute.
