      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:55,854
            narrator:           
with a black market for firearms

4
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,790
          and terrorism         
       a worldwide threat,      

5
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,393
  armed forces need to protect  
         their munitions        

6
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,328
          from getting          
      into the wrong hands.     

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,932
   weapons are often stored in  
 earth-covered concrete bunkers 

8
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,934
    that have special doors.    

9
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,877
    these mammoth steel doors   
 are designed to prevent anyone 

10
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,147
     from blasting their way    
     into a military bunker     

11
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,017
     to access the munitions    
         stored inside.         

12
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,220
      the key to the doors'     
     exceptional strength --    

13
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,690
      a grid structure core     
      made from steel slats     

14
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:34,260
  6 inches wide and 6mm thick.  

15
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,965
     a computer-guided torch    
     notches half the slats     

16
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,635
       so the other half        
       can slot into them       

17
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,537
   to form the grid structure.  

18
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,444
        workers assemble        
       the grid structure       

19
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:53,646
       on top of a nearly       
   1/2-inch-thick steel plate,  

20
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,782
 the exterior face of the door. 

21
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,585
     because the grids have     
   empty space in the middle,   

22
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,188
          they provide          
   three-dimensional strength   

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,523
  without the excessive weight  
        of a solid core.        

24
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,828
      even so, these doors      
   weigh almost 10 tons each.   

25
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,664
         once the slats         
       are all assembled,       

26
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,335
     workers weld the bottom    
   of the grids to the plate.   

27
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,474
  then with a manual gas torch, 
 they trim the ends of the slats

28
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,544
      so they'll fit inside     
the channel of the steel framing

29
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,680
          that will run         
      around the perimeter.     

30
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:41,494
 once they've installed framing 
       on all four sides,       

31
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,696
      they clamp everything     
          in position,          

32
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,865
      then weld all around.     

33
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,046
     they run a string line     
      to properly position      

34
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,047
  and weld l-shaped steel tabs  

35
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,483
           to the top           
     of the grid structure.     

36
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,986
    these tabs, two per grid,   

37
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,557
 will support the interior face 
          of the door.          

38
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,601
    then they fill each grid    
 with mineral fiber insulation. 

39
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,203
     this prevents moisture     

40
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,073
         from condensing        
   on the inside of the door.   

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,022
    they take the steel plate   
   for the interior door face,  

42
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:46,859
   drill several 1/2-inch-wide  
       holes through it...      

43
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,764
          ...and lay it         
       onto the structure,      

44
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,433
       aligning the holes       
       with the grid tabs.      

45
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,637
   then they weld the plate's   
    perimeter to the framing    

46
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,240
          and each hole         
   to the grid tab beneath it.  

47
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,724
   once workers have finished   
     constructing the doors,    

48
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,995
     they weld on hinge pins    
     and locking mechanisms.    

49
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,130
            the frame           
     on which the doors hang    

50
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,599
      is made of two heavy,     
      vertical steel beams      

51
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,671
    with hinge pin receivers    
 and two horizontal steel tubes.

52
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:36,141
          in the middle         
  is a temporary cross bracing  

53
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,010
    to keep the frame square    

54
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,812
 and to prevent it from buckling
  under the weight of the doors 

55
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:44,149
before installation is complete.

56
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:49,288
     onsite, the installers     
   first mount the door frame.  

57
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,224
     then, using a forklift     
     with an extended boom,     

58
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,026
  a type of heavy lifting arm,  

59
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,029
     they carefully descend     
     the door's hinge pins      

60
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,465
into the receivers on the frame.

61
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,970
        crews then build        
 the bunker's concrete structure

62
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,706
   around the installed door.   

63
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,509
        once the concrete       
       has properly cured,      

64
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,045
      they remove the frame     
         cross bracing.         

65
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,849
      a handle on the door      
      releases a foot bolt,     

66
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:19,718
    which slots into the base   
          of the frame.         

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,788
  this prevents the locked door 
          from bowing.          

68
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,794
         the lock itself        
     is a massive dead bolt     

69
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,664
   with a tungsten-carbide rod  
             inside,            

70
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,200
      making it impossible      
         to saw through.        

71
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,202
 as an added layer of security, 

72
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,071
      the military installs     
       a monitoring system      

73
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,605
     that sends out a signal    

74
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,275
     the second anyone tries    
        to open the door,       

75
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,677
       even with the key.       

76
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,878
  if the entry is unauthorized, 

77
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,116
 soldiers descend on the bunker 
   to apprehend the intruder.   

78
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,364
  narrator: throughout history, 

79
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,768
 women have enhanced their lips 
           with color.          

80
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,371
      cleopatra led the way     
      over 2,000 years ago.     

81
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,709
      she used crushed ants     
 and beetles to redden her lips.

82
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:20,446
    today a tube of lipstick    
      does the job nicely.      

83
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,215
     no need to mess around     
       with crushed bugs.       

84
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,720
    lipstick comes in a case    

85
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,322
        that also serves        
        as an applicator,       

86
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:32,124
  and that's the beauty of it.  

87
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,659
    just just twist the stick   
         and apply color        

88
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,862
     to make lackluster lips    
         look luscious.         

89
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,532
      lipstick ingredients      
         include waxes,         

90
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,102
   pigments, and moisturizers.  

91
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,807
 a worker pre-weighs everything 
      following a formula.      

92
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,945
        the exact blends        
  are usually a company secret. 

93
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,284
     she pours the measured     
   ingredients into a kettle,   

94
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:02,153
           that melts           
    and mixes them together.    

95
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,424
   she adds a plant-based gel   
      known as plantolatum.     

96
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,826
 it will act as a skin softener 

97
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:12,163
  and also enable the lipstick  
     to be smoothly applied.    

98
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,769
  different waxes -- carnauba,  
   candelilla, and beeswax --   

99
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,837
    add body to the mixture.    

100
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,106
       the waxes will also      
        give the lipstick       

101
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,710
         a certain sheen        
        upon application.       

102
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:28,113
 with the base mixture prepared,

103
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,516
        she now whips up        
       a batch of pigment       

104
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:34,586
         using different        
      iron oxide colorants.     

105
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,724
   she scoops it onto rollers   
that grind the pigment particles

106
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,994
        while rolling it        
        into sheet form.        

107
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:45,798
      it takes three passes     
       through the rollers      

108
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,265
   to fully grind the pigment.  

109
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,536
     it's ready to be added     
      to the base mixture.      

110
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:53,071
       she lowers the heat      
          in the kettle         

111
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,074
            to avoid            
    scalding the ingredients.   

112
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,545
        she adds pigment        
   until the mixture thickens   

113
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,780
       and becomes creamy.      

114
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:09,321
 it's now the right consistency 
   to be shaped into lipstick.  

115
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,625
  it's over to the next station 

116
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,361
      where another worker      
    pours the lipstick liquid   

117
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,764
     into a filling machine.    

118
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,299
       this filling system      
        also has a mixer        

119
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,635
   that keeps the consistency   
             creamy.            

120
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,505
        she places a mold       
    under the filling machine   

121
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,040
      and activates a lift.     

122
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,308
it serves up the mold to nozzles

123
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,179
    that pump lipstick liquid   
   into the slots of the mold.  

124
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,781
      she continues to fill     
         lipstick molds         

125
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,119
 until the supply in the machine
       has been depleted.       

126
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:42,388
      she places the molds      
         on a conveyer,         

127
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,721
        which takes them        

128
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,059
 through a nearly five-foot-long
         cooling tunnel.        

129
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:50,729
     the chilly trip causes     
the lipstick liquid to solidify.

130
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,400
   the lipsticks are now ready  

131
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,871
      for their swiveling,      
      tubular containers.       

132
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,874
       she places a rack        
       on top of the mold       

133
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,477
      and inserts the cases     
     into slots on the rack.    

134
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:10,882
      the slots are aligned     
 with the lipsticks in the mold.

135
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,220
         then it's over         
   to the turnaround machine.   

136
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,889
          bursts of air         
    gently push the lipstick    

137
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,826
         out of the mold        
     and up into the cases.     

138
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,962
           to assist,           
  little pushers apply pressure 

139
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,031
  to the bottoms of the cases.  

140
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,367
     the lipsticks have made    
their transfer without a smudge.

141
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:35,307
       she sets them down       
 and removes the transfer rack. 

142
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,311
      on another conveyor,      
the lipsticks pass by heat guns.

143
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,713
 the hot air melts the lipsticks
          just a little         

144
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,982
       to make them shine.      

145
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,319
  continuing on, the lipsticks  
       travel past rollers      

146
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:52,991
  that turn the cases to cause  
  the lipsticks to swivel down. 

147
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,328
  a testers samples a lipstick  
        from every batch        

148
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,596
 to determine the melting point.

149
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,665
        this is important       

150
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,600
   because lipstick should be   
          stable enough         

151
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:06,004
     not to melt in a purse     
          on a hot day.         

152
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,608
   he smears lipstick shavings  
        onto a glass disk       

153
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,679
 and examines their consistency.

154
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:18,150
      he places the sample      
      on a heating element      

155
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,953
  and swings a magnifying glass 
  overhead for a close-up view  

156
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,957
    as the lipstick shavings    
       melt into a puddle.      

157
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,627
     checking a thermometer,    

158
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,096
           he confirms          
     that the melting point     

159
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,031
 is within an acceptable range. 

160
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,435
         another worker         
     then compares the color    

161
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,905
  of the freshly made lipstick  
        to the standard,        

162
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,174
        and it's a match.       

163
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:46,244
   so they wrap up production   
       with a plastic cap.      

164
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,849
  the cap is clear to showcase  
   the shade of the lipstick.   

165
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:57,990
    it has taken about a day    
  to manufacture this lipstick. 

166
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,626
    it's time to freshen up.    

167
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,275
    narrator: there's no need   
       to close your eyes       

168
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,611
      and imagine you're in     
       a tropical paradise      

169
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:23,348
   when artificial palm trees   
  are part of the landscaping.  

170
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,818
    they can provide a touch    
   of tropical in any climate,  

171
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,553
   but making a synthetic copy  

172
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,156
       of one of nature's       
      towering achievements     

173
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,358
        is no small task.       

174
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,764
   with artificial palm trees,  

175
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,100
      there are no watering     
  or other maintenance worries, 

176
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,371
   so you really have it made   
          in the shade.         

177
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,975
   to manufacture a palm tree,  
 a worker wraps sticky mesh tape

178
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:54,580
     around a tubular piece     
     of polyvinyl chloride.     

179
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:57,582
    this tube will establish    
    the shape of the trunk,     

180
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,752
     and the tape will allow    
the next layers to adhere to it.

181
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,523
      while all that taping     
          is going on,          

182
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:09,461
    a welder pieces together    
the tree's solid-steel skeleton.

183
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,398
     he welds the base plate    
           to a pole.           

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,937
  he strengthens the joint with 
lateral supports called gussets.

185
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,606
           the gussets          
   should enable the palm tree  

186
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,242
    to withstand heavy winds.   

187
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,213
         he adds height         
      to the tree skeleton      

188
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,948
  with another piece of steel.  

189
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,152
  artificial palm trees can be  
  made to exact specifications, 

190
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,222
        while in nature,        
    things are less precise.    

191
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,427
          after a coat          
    of rust-inhibiting paint,   

192
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,163
     they're ready to insert    
       the steel skeleton       

193
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,300
    into the taped pvc pipe.    

194
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,435
        one worker clamps       
 the end of the steel structure 

195
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,837
           to a table,          

196
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,007
and the other member of the team
 slides the trunk core onto it. 

197
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,312
      they screw the trunk      
      to the steel skeleton     

198
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,714
       in several places.       

199
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,450
       with a foot pedal,       

200
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,985
      a member of the team      
      activates a spindle,      

201
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,854
and it turns the palm tree trunk

202
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,592
   so he can efficiently wrap   
   synthetic rubber around it.  

203
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,996
      the effect simulates      
      natural growth rings.     

204
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,466
     he brushes an adhesive     
        onto the rubber,        

205
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,435
   ensuring complete coverage.  

206
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,810
  the adhesive is high-strength 
         and waterproof,        

207
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,612
    qualities that will allow   
     this synthetic concrete    

208
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,015
         to stick to it         
    in all kinds of weather.    

209
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,951
      the concrete is made      
      of many components,       

210
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,620
       including silicone       
       and liquid rubber,       

211
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,023
     and is the consistency     
        of peanut butter.       

212
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,162
          he spreads it         
onto the entire palm tree trunk.

213
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:53,498
    after an overnight cure,    
     the coating solidifies     

214
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,501
        and he paints it        
    with exterior latex paint   

215
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,637
      using a light touch.      

216
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,772
        he adds contrast        
       with darker paint.       

217
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,842
 it highlights the rubber ridges
          on the trunk          

218
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,877
 to make it look more authentic.

219
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,048
     while the paint dries,     

220
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,785
     he turns his attention     
 to the slotted steel trunk cap.

221
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:20,792
he applies some of the synthetic
   concrete used on the trunk.  

222
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,728
  it will serve as an adhesive  

223
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,398
        as he now presses       
a cocoa-fiber fringe to the cap.

224
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,203
       the fringe of fiber      
      camouflages the steel     

225
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,674
        and makes the cap       
     look like a tree husk.     

226
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:39,644
      he ties it with wire      
  to maintain the arrangement.  

227
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:49,487
   he tightens it with pliers   
   and snips off the excess.    

228
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:54,025
 he disguises the wire with more
   of the synthetic concrete.   

229
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,400
and after it cures, he paints it
   to match the cocoa fibers.   

230
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,506
     successfully disguised     
    by cocoa fiber and paint,   

231
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,208
     he bolts the steel cap     
         to the treetop.        

232
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,380
         the next worker        
     tapes a flat steel bar     

233
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,585
   to the stem of palm foliage  
 which is made of polyethylene. 

234
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,861
     he reinforces the job      
     with two metal clamps.     

235
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:39,171
  he crimps the clamps tightly  
      to the stem and bar.      

236
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,609
       these palm fronds,       
       as they're called,       

237
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,478
   provide the crowning touch.  

238
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,280
   they insert the steel bars   
       in the slotted cap       

239
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,351
  and then bend the fronds back 
   to a more realistic angle.   

240
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,091
           it's taken           
    about an hour and a half    

241
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,094
         to manufacture         
   this artificial palm tree,   

242
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,832
  easier than waiting a decade  
 or more for a real one to grow.

243
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:11,336
     and with the job done,     
  it's time for a piÑa colada.  

244
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,719
    narrator: a brass plaque    

245
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,787
     prominently identifies     
       an important site.       

246
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,723
   think historical landmarks,  
           memorials,           

247
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,793
      hospital donor walls,     
         walks of fame.         

248
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,996
     many professional firms    
     identify their offices     

249
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,666
         and many homes         
     display their addresses    

250
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,569
     with an elegant plaque     
         made of brass.         

251
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,207
   a brass plaque makes a bold  
     and lasting statement.     

252
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,077
           making one           
   begins with a wooden model,  

253
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,679
      minus the lettering,      

254
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,683
  covered in artificial leather 
where they want a bumpy texture.

255
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,953
       they use this model      
  to cast an aluminum pattern.  

256
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,090
  a typesetter draws guidelines 
         on the pattern         

257
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,490
      for the inscription,      

258
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,628
   then glues pewter lettering  
          on the lines.         

259
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,696
   getting the pattern perfect  
          is essential,         

260
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,966
    as this is what they use    
      to make the sand mold     

261
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:18,369
  for casting the brass plaque. 

262
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,506
    the typesetter hands off    
   the pattern to the molders,  

263
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,376
      who spray the surface     
      with a release agent,     

264
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,512
     the industrial version     
   of nonstick cooking spray.   

265
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,315
  this will prevent the pattern 
          from adhering         

266
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,317
        to the sand mold        
 they're about to make with it. 

267
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,654
    after laying the pattern    
   in a high-edge steel frame,  

268
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:40,325
     they pour in a mixture     
    of silica sand and resin,   

269
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,861
      filling it to the top     
     and compacting tightly.    

270
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:47,332
        after 15 minutes,       
        the resin cures,        

271
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,267
   binding the grains of sand.  

272
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:53,405
the molders then flip the frame 
and lift off the top half of it.

273
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,207
      a hard block of sand      
      is in the bottom half     

274
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,410
    containing a mirror image   
     of the plaque pattern.     

275
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,079
      this is the sand mold     

276
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,616
     with which they'll cast    
      the plaque in brass.      

277
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,685
           the molders          
      now spray the surface     

278
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,021
         with a solution        
    of alcohol and graphite,    

279
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,090
 then they burn off the alcohol 
         with a lighter,        

280
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,426
         leaving behind         
       a film of graphite.      

281
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,028
    this heat-resistant layer   

282
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,697
   will prevent the sand mold   
          from eroding          

283
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,901
   when it comes into contact   
     with the molten metal.     

284
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:27,171
   workers charge the furnace   
       with brass ingots,       

285
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:31,576
as well as with pieces of excess
  brass from previous castings. 

286
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,913
    the furnace temperature,    
    2,300 degrees fahrenheit,   

287
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:38,249
    liquifies the solid metal   
      in about 20 minutes.      

288
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,585
        then the molders        
      pour the molten brass     

289
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,988
         through a hole         
     at the top of the mold.    

290
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,858
   the hole feeds two channels  
     leading to the cavity.     

291
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,596
            the metal           
 begins solidifying immediately.

292
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,198
    however, it's a good hour   

293
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,067
       before the casting       
       is fully hardened,       

294
00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:00,271
    at which point, they open   
 the mold to extract the plaque.

295
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,473
   attached to it are runners,  

296
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,809
  excess metal that solidifies  
         in the channels        

297
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,213
   leading to the mold cavity.  

298
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,216
   so, after knocking the sand  
        out of the frame        

299
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,717
    to release the plaque...    

300
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,357
  ...they saw off the runners,  

301
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,893
         then throw them        
      back into the furnace     

302
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,362
         to be remelted         
      for the next casting.     

303
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,631
       they grind the edge      
          of the plaque         

304
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,166
     with an abrasive wheel,    

305
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,168
       smoothing the nubs       
 where the runners were cut off 

306
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,573
 and making the plaque perfectly
    round and straight-edged.   

307
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,710
      with a steel scraper,     
   they clean up the surface,   

308
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,178
    removing flakes of metal    

309
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,716
      and remnants of sand      
          and graphite.         

310
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:48,953
 they dissolve sulfurated potash
         in warm water.         

311
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,328
     this chemical solution     
         oxidizes metal,        

312
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,531
    creating what looks like    
        a natural patina,       

313
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,968
   a darkening of the surface   
     that develops with age.    

314
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,142
  after preparing the solution, 

315
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,945
        they transfer it        
        to a large basin.       

316
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,514
       a kiddy wading pool      
         does the trick.        

317
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,886
    then they dip the plaque,   
      keeping it submerged      

318
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,824
  until they get enough patina  
 to make the brass look antique.

319
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,163
   they rinse off the chemical  
           with water           

320
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,866
       and dry the plaque       
      with compressed air.      

321
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,240
        they gently press       
    a vibrating abrasive belt   

322
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,441
       against the plaque.      

323
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,912
it polishes the raised surfaces,
      removing their patina     

324
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,148
          and restoring         
       their brassy shine.      

325
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,589
  this finishing creates depth  

326
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,393
   by highlighting the relief   
  against the dark background.  

327
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,199
       just one last step       
   before the plaque is ready   

328
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,867
   to take its rightful place.  

329
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,604
    workers spray the surface   
 with a coat of clear urethane. 

330
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,341
     this prevents the brass    
         from tarnishing        

331
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,276
     and protects the plaque    
         from weathering        

332
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,845
     when mounted outdoors.     

333
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,957
