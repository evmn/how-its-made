00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:07,773
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,255
 narrator: the first stock cars 
  were souped-up family sedans. 

4
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:59,859
 but today, they're custom-built
       for the racetrack.       

5
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,661
          each car body         
     must match the contours    

6
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,797
   of templates set by nascar,  

7
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,167
    the national association    
    of stock car auto racing.   

8
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,610
        on the racetrack,       
       the shape of a car       

9
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,880
 can give it an aerodynamic edge
      over the competition,     

10
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:26,118
 so in nascar races, car bodies 
    must have uniform curves.   

11
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:29,288
  the regulations put the focus 
         on driver skill        

12
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,357
  and make the race a fair one. 

13
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:34,560
         they mold some         
     of the car's body parts    

14
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,629
       from a carbon fiber      
      and kevlar material.      

15
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,766
   first, a technician applies  
    a release agent to a mold   

16
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,701
    for the car's front end.    

17
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,438
then he sprays a paint undercoat
            into it.            

18
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:50,843
 this undercoat will eventually 
transfer to the completed panel.

19
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:55,314
a computerized cutter slices the
 carbon fiber and kevlar fabric 

20
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,949
          into strips.          

21
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,720
     it produces 22 pieces,     

22
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:05,457
       each one cut to fit      
a different section of the mold.

23
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,994
the technician rolls epoxy resin
         onto the fabric        

24
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,462
      one strip at a time.      

25
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,466
         once the strip         
   has been completely coated,  

26
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,601
  he transfers it to the mold.  

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,407
       he tucks the fabric      
        into the contours       

28
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,909
         and smooths out        
        any big wrinkles.       

29
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,481
 he layers the strips three deep
  in a crisscross configuration 

30
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,417
    for structural integrity.   

31
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,589
  a co-worker covers the carbon 
 fiber with perforated plastic. 

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,828
  they add layers of absorbent  
  polyester and thick plastic,  

33
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,765
         which they glue        
    to the edge of the mold.    

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,034
      they insert a fitting     
      and connect a vacuum,     

35
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:52,638
       which sucks out air      
     and excess epoxy resin.    

36
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:55,441
     the polyester material     
       soaks up the resin       

37
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,178
  as it flows through the holes 
   in the first plastic layer.  

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,648
 this both smooths and compacts 
    the carbon-fiber layers.    

39
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:07,253
    then it's into a hot oven   
    to bake for three hours.    

40
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,121
    this activates the epoxy    

41
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:12,925
   and combines the layers of   
 carbon fiber and kevlar fabric.

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,529
       an employee removes      
  the completed stock-car panel 

43
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:17,830
        and inspects it.        

44
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,801
         then it's over         
       to a weigh station.      

45
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,069
     at just under 8 pounds,    

46
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,540
     the part is lightweight    
   yet virtually shatterproof.  

47
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,675
 meanwhile, at another factory, 

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,411
         work begins on         
     the stock-car chassis.     

49
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,082
 they build it from square steel
   tubing that's super strong.  

50
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,617
           an employee          
    welds the pieces together   

51
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,353
  to create a support structure 
          for the car.          

52
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,955
      at the next station,      

53
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,693
  a worker forces narrow steel  
   tubing against a spiral bit  

54
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,829
     to carve notches in it.    

55
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,598
           this tubing          
      is for the roll cage,     

56
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,836
 the structure that protects the
 driver if there's an accident. 

57
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:01,573
      the notches will help     
       form better joints.      

58
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:06,244
   he grinds the rough edges,   
    creating a smooth surface   

59
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,248
        to weld the tube        
  to the rest of the roll cage. 

60
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,724
     once complete, the team    
     transfers the roll cage    

61
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,961
        to the main frame       
         of the chassis.        

62
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,533
        they tack-weld it       
  before doing the final welds. 

63
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,673
          the next part         
    is called the rear clip.    

64
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:39,745
 it holds the fuel tank and has 
 mounts for the rear suspension.

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,881
     with the car framework     
          now complete,         

66
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,485
      a technician scans it     
using a digital measuring probe.

67
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,789
     the scan confirms that     
   the dimensions are correct.  

68
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:54,092
        they now assemble       
        the various steel       

69
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:57,663
   and carbon-fiber body parts  
   to the stock-car framework.  

70
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,369
          they measure          
     the completed car body     

71
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,705
 by laying template grids on it.

72
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:11,710
      the biggest one sits      
   over the center of the car.  

73
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,113
        they pull a gauge       
        through the gaps        

74
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,715
      between the templates     
        and the car body.       

75
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:22,521
      the gap cannot exceed     
  the tolerances set by nascar. 

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,190
 they often must tweak the shape
         of a body part         

77
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,126
      to meet regulations.      

78
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,330
 once the car has been painted, 

79
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,000
   they apply headlight decals  
where the real ones usually are.

80
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,603
         real headlights        
    would add too much weight   

81
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,306
     and pose a safety risk     
       if they shattered.       

82
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,210
     it's taken three weeks     
       of intensive work,       

83
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,014
     but this stock-car body    
 is now ready for the mechanics.

84
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,484
        things are about        
        to pick up speed.       

85
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,234
  narrator: the game of hurling 
   has been played in ireland   

86
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,435
    for at least 2,000 years.   

87
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:13,171
      players swing a stick     
         called a hurley        

88
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:17,376
     to hit a ball the size     
  of a hockey puck into a net.  

89
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,577
      winning takes skill,      
         quick reflexes,        

90
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,147
         and, of course,        
     the luck of the irish.     

91
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,254
          pass the ball         
   and pass on the tradition.   

92
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,255
 hurling is a game that's older 

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,858
    than the recorded history   
           of ireland.          

94
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:40,599
  in ireland, hurleys are still 
  made the old-fashioned way -- 

95
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,968
     by hand in small shops.    

96
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,940
   ash is the wood of choice.   

97
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,809
     they use only the part     
    of the tree near the root   

98
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,679
     because the grain flows    
    in a natural curve there,   

99
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,616
  making the stick less likely  
      to break during play.     

100
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,286
        the hurley maker        
        slices the trunk        

101
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,155
           into planks          
    that are one inch thick.    

102
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:07,226
      he'll make one hurley     
        from each plank.        

103
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,962
      he stacks the planks      

104
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:14,333
   and then picks through them  
   to select one for shaping.   

105
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,374
    he scrutinizes the curve    
   of the grain on the boards.  

106
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,842
     it needs to be suitable    

107
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,645
   for the size of the hurley   
        he'll be making.        

108
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,914
       his selection made,      

109
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,718
     he places a see-through    
  plastic pattern on the board. 

110
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,655
   the transparency allows him  
 to find the curve of the grain 

111
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,125
   and position it within the   
 striking surface of the hurley.

112
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,562
  he draws an outline around it 
         with a pencil.         

113
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,867
        after a rough cut       
    and some initial shaping,   

114
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:52,571
    he re-pencils the pattern   
  and cuts it with a band saw.  

115
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,679
      the striking surface      
of the hurley is called the bas.

116
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,516
 it's the most substantial part 
          of the stick.         

117
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,956
 he sculpts the stick to various
   thicknesses with a planer.   

118
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,764
  he keeps it thick at the bas  
    and thins it at the stem    

119
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,832
        to give the stick       
         some elasticity        

120
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,301
     when striking the ball.    

121
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:25,871
   this will allow the player   
    to hit the ball farther.    

122
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:36,582
       he sands the edges       
     to make them more even.    

123
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:40,119
        he tapers the bas       
        to the very end,        

124
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:43,322
creating a sloped surface so the
  ball can be picked up easily. 

125
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,529
        he then switches        
  to a finer grid abrasive belt 

126
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,132
      and sands the handle      
    and the rest of the stick   

127
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,034
    until it's super smooth.    

128
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,938
   next, he cuts steel banding  
           to a length          

129
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,375
    that's a little more than   
 twice the diameter of the bas. 

130
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,813
        he loops the band       
    around the end of the bas   

131
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,749
   and clamps it snugly to it.  

132
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,789
      he drives large nails     
  into the band to puncture it. 

133
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,827
    he hammers smaller nails    
        into those holes        

134
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,963
         and all the way        
        through the wood.       

135
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,636
 he clips the protruding nails. 

136
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:35,941
  he then flattens the cut ends 
 to turn the nails into rivets. 

137
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,247
        he folds the ends       
   of the looped band together  

138
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,851
      at the rim of the bas     
   and nails them to the wood.  

139
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,656
     now securely attached,     

140
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,592
         the steel band         
    will reinforce the hurley   

141
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:58,464
 at its most vulnerable point --
the end of the striking surface.

142
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,533
        not every player        
   wants their hurley banded.   

143
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,603
  this is an optional feature.  

144
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,606
    he now winds rubber tape    
      just under the handle     

145
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,941
      for better gripping.      

146
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,279
    he continues to twist it    
     partway down the stick     

147
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,217
    because players sometimes   
 grip it there with both hands. 

148
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,488
     he finishes the wrap at    
 both ends with electrical tape,

149
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,823
       which has stronger       
        adhesive backing.       

150
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,927
   it will prevent unraveling   
       of the rubber tape.      

151
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:36,100
   it's taken about 20 minutes  
   to craft this hurley stick.  

152
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:39,237
      how long it will last     
       is anyone's guess.       

153
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,440
 there's no warranty on hurleys,

154
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,242
     and it's sure to break     
          at some point         

155
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,178
because hurling is a rough game.

156
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:51,283
     some players go through    
 several hurleys in one season. 

157
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,188
        it doesn't matter       
       if you lose a stick      

158
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,191
  as long as you win the game.  

159

            narrator:           
       in an audio system,      

160
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,544
 the amplifier is the component 
  which makes the sound louder  

161
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:22,548
  and sends it to the speakers. 

162
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,751
  while most amps on the market 
   are powered by transistors,  

163
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:29,688
        many audiophiles        
    swear by tube amplifiers,   

164
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,558
         which use older        
     vacuum-tube technology.    

165
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,329
      [ guitar notes play ]     

166
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,166
          many believe          
      that tube amplifiers      

167
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:44,969
        produce a warmer,       
       more natural sound.      

168
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,439
  this factory makes the amp's  
          main chassis          

169
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,841
          from a sheet          
  of polished stainless steel.  

170
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,244
  a computer-guided punch press 

171
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:55,247
      cuts openings for the     
 power switches, control knobs, 

172
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,781
      and other components.     

173
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,252
the press prepares eight chassis
           per sheet.           

174
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:04,188
      workers separate them     
 with a few strikes of a mallet.

175
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,325
      then they place them      
          one at a time         

176
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,661
      in a bending machine      
      called a press break.     

177
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,264
  once they position the sheet  
 with the help of metal guides, 

178
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,067
   they activate a foot pedal,  

179
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,971
  releasing 90 tons of pressure 
 to bend the edge of the sheet. 

180
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,608
        then they remove        
        the adhesive film       

181
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:26,411
    which has been protecting   
    the mirror-finish surface   

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,813
         of the chassis.        

183
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:31,850
  they clean off any remaining  
 adhesive residue with alcohol. 

184
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:37,155
    then they put the chassis   
      into an offset press.     

185
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,891
       using a silk-screen      
        printing process,       

186
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,694
     it labels the controls     
        and connections.        

187
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,965
 next are the speaker terminals,

188
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,834
 which connect the speaker wires
           to the amp.          

189
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,171
    these connectors are made   
      of gold-plated brass,     

190
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,106
  which are nonmagnetic metals. 

191
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,976
    magnetic ones would react   
     to the electric current    

192
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,712
      and cause distortion.     

193
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,582
  the terminal's circuit board, 
         installed next,        

194
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,652
  carries the amplified signal  
   from the main circuit board  

195
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,786
    to the speaker terminals.   

196
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,322
    they install and connect    
        the power switch        

197
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,593
    and the circuit board for   
  the vacuum-tube illumination. 

198
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:17,629
         this indicates         
       the tube's status.       

199
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,801
     meanwhile, this machine    
  winds strands of copper wire  

200
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,536
     around plastic bobbins     

201
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,139
    to begin making the amp's   
      output transformers.      

202
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,342
       output transformers      
    match the amp's circuitry   

203
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:35,680
to the electronic specifications
 of different types of speakers.

204
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:38,617
      the number of wires,      
     their different gauges,    

205
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,619
  and the number of revolutions 
        around the bobbin       

206
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,622
       create this unique       
         compatibility.         

207
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,692
     after taping the wires     
     to prevent unraveling,     

208
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,696
 they join, then solder the ends
      to additional wiring.     

209
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,166
     they will later connect    
    to the amp's main board.    

210
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:58,302
       a fiberglass sleeve      
    insulates the connection.   

211
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,773
      they place the bobbin     
    in a lamination machine.    

212
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,177
   laminations are thin plates  
        of carbon steel.        

213
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,181
     the machine stacks them    
     all around the bobbin.     

214
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:13,685
 then workers put a bolt in each
  corner to hold them together. 

215
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,660
 they place the laminated bobbin
     in an aluminum housing     

216
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,796
   and pour in hot black tar.   

217
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,133
this immobilizes the laminations
      so they won't rattle      

218
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,936
   when the amp is amplifying   
        low frequencies.        

219
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,073
      then workers install      
   the two output transformers  

220
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,942
        into the chassis,       

221
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,479
 along with a third transformer 
        to power the amp.       

222
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,083
       they take the amp's      
       main circuit board,      

223
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,086
     plug in ceramic sockets    
     for the vacuum tubes...    

224
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,725
...and solder the sockets' leads
          to the board.         

225
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,563
       then, after feeding      
     the transformer leads,     

226
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,199
    they mount the main board   
         in the chassis,        

227
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:05,103
      screwing it to posts      
      to hold it in place.      

228
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,540
        then they connect       
     the transformer leads.     

229
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,051
   they plug the vacuum tubes   
  one by one into the sockets.  

230
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,388
   the tubes are made of glass  
   with a heat-resistant base.  

231
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,525
      the interior contains     
     a combination of metals    

232
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,462
           but no air,          
   hence the term vacuum tube.  

233
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,331
 the amp has 11 tubes in all -- 

234
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,067
        seven small ones        
     to power input signals     

235
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,203
          from a source         
       such as a cd player      

236
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,974
        and four big ones       
to power output to the speakers.

237
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,281
  then they attach the chassis' 
     ventilated bottom cover    

238
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,484
     made of painted steel.     

239
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,618
        they affix decals       

240
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,221
        to differentiate        
     the output transformers    

241
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,256
   from the power transformer.  

242
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,695
    l.e.d. lights turn green    
   when the amp is powered up   

243
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,764
      and ready to deliver      
    that warm, natural sound    

244
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,968
        that many believe       
  only traditional vacuum tubes 

245
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,870
          can produce.          

246
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,389
 narrator: people generally like
their coffee either hot or iced,

247
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,792
         hence the need         
   for the thermal coffee pot.  

248
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:38,062
       pour in hot coffee,      
   and the pot holds in heat,   

249
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,197
       keeping the coffee       
       at that temperature      

250
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,200
      for a good half-hour.     

251
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,543
  the trick to a thermal coffee 
   pot is in the construction.  

252
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,346
      both the body and lid     
       have a double wall,      

253
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,414
 two layers of stainless steel. 

254
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:00,217
   between them is a tiny gap   
    just 5 to 6 millimeters.    

255
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,622
       the air in this gap      
    insulates the inner wall,   

256
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,157
        trapping the heat       
         inside the pot.        

257
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,495
         they start with        
     a stainless-steel sheet    

258
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,831
   just 1.2 millimeters thick.  

259
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,967
   the first step is to cut it  
       into smaller pieces      

260
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,435
     on a mechanical press.     

261
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:21,572
 to make the coffee pot's body, 
    they cut it into strips,    

262
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:27,044
  then each strip into squares  
      measuring 8x8 inches.     

263
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,181
    then they put each square   
  in another mechanical press.  

264
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,451
      it stamps the square      
      onto a circular die,      

265
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,453
   which cuts it into a disk.   

266
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,057
    they'll now use this disk   
     to make the outer wall.    

267
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,926
        they run the disk       
      through a lubricator      

268
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,530
 that coats the surface with oil
      to aid the next step      

269
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,601
       on a machine called      
 a hydraulic deep drawing press.

270
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,337
      the machine's molders     
       draw the flat disk       

271
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,272
 into a three-dimensional shape.

272
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,942
         this stretches         
   the stainless-steel fibers   

273
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,011
    to a very fragile state.    

274
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,546
    they strengthen the piece   

275
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,815
        by what's called        
     thermic normalization,     

276
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,285
        heating the metal       
  to 1,800 degrees fahrenheit,  

277
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,822
      then letting it cool      
      to room temperature.      

278
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,426
      this process restores     
the original molecular structure

279
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,027
     of the stainless steel     

280
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,497
   so it can be shaped further  
        without breaking.       

281
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:23,535
    but first, they even out    
 the jagged rim with a trimmer. 

282
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,777
    then they return the wall   
    to the deep drawing press   

283
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,713
         outfitted with         
  a differently shaped molder.  

284
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,051
    the second drawing tapers   
the wall to a more rounded shape

285
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:44,723
    and forms a base to make    
   the bottom perfectly flat.   

286
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,524
 then it's back to the trimmer, 

287
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:50,128
 outfitted with a different tool
  this time, to smooth the rim. 

288
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,667
   they repeat the same steps   

289
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,335
    to make the coffee pot's    
           inner wall.          

290
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:01,873
     the deep drawing press     
 pulls the stainless-steel disk 

291
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,808
 into a slightly different shape

292
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,145
      with a lip protruding     
          to one side.          

293
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:14,885
       they heat the wall       
      in the induction oven     

294
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,821
           to restore           
     the molecular structure    

295
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,456
    before shaping the metal    
            further.            

296
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:24,629
    then they place the wall    
 in a mold and release a press. 

297
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:33,104
 this shapes the protruding lip 
          into a spout.         

298
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,309
   then they transfer the wall  
        to another press,       

299
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,546
   which stamps it with a die,  
    cutting off excess metal.   

300
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:47,118
     they check to make sure    
 that the inner and outer walls 

301
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,652
     fit together properly.     

302
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,254
     if everything is fine,     

303
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,724
     they polish both walls     
         inside and out.        

304
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,926
    a little polishing paste    

305
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:57,595
   applied with a sisal brush   
     on the polishing wheel     

306
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,265
   has the surfaces glistening  
           in no time.          

307
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,636
  the surface is now perfectly  
  smooth and ready for welding. 

308
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,005
    the first part they weld    

309
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,542
       is the coffee pot's      
     stainless-steel handle.    

310
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,645
 they shape it with two strikes 
    of a press, then polish.    

311
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,016
     they use a spot welder     

312
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,152
       to fuse the handle       
    to the pot's outer wall.    

313
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,958
     then they turn the wall    
           upside down          

314
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,328
to stamp the manufacturer's logo
        into the bottom.        

315
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,766
        now the assembly.       

316
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,301
    they place the inner wall   
          on a fixture,         

317
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,170
  then the outer wall over it.  

318
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:43,842
    a press pushes the inner    
      to the correct depth.     

319
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,043
  then they weld along the rim  
       of the outer wall,       

320
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,580
   fusing it to the inner one.  

321
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:54,718
    the coffee pot's lid also   
has double walls for insulation.

322
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,921
    they weld a hinged lever    
           to the lid           

323
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,291
  and the adjoining part of the 
  hinge to the coffee-pot body. 

324
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,130
  then they gently hammer a pin 
       through the hinge,       

325
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,934
  riveting the ends of the pin  
   so that it can't fall out.   

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,208
    after a thorough cleaning   
        in a dishwasher,        

327
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,211
 the coffee pot is ready to use.
