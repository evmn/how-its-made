00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,958
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,293
fiberglass insulation...    

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,199
...wooden ducks...       

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,772
...gumball machines...     

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,844
...and exhaust systems.    

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,388
it's pink and fluffy, and it keeps us warm.     

7
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,857
fiberglass insulation is a great way         

8
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,126
to prevent heat loss from our buildings.       

9
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,463
it has a woolly texture,    
but it is, as the name suggests,

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,599
made of very fine threads of glass.           

11
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:12,237
that's why it's sometimes referred to as glass wool.   

12
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,877
fiberglass insulation will reduce energy consumption,

13
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,679
but it also reduces waste   

14
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,215
because it's made from at least
35% recycled glass.      

15
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,885
the recipe also includes what's called the batch --   

16
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,688
a lot of sand and smaller portions of soda ash,     

17
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,890
limestone, and other minerals. 

18
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:37,028
the glass, called cullet, used to be bottles and windows.

19
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,299
this will be its second recycling.     

20
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,035
the cullet and batch ingredients

21
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,103
spill onto a conveyer-belt system,    

22
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,306
which transports it all to an electric furnace.    

23
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,442
the conveyer moves back and forth      

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,645
to evenly distribute the cullet
and batch ingredients.     

25
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,182
they seep down and melt into a previous mix, 

26
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,486
which is now a pool of glass at the bottom of the furnace. 

27
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,862
the glass liquid now flows out of the furnace  

28
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,264
and into sloped channels.   

29
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,602
inside these channels,     

30
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,271
the temperature is kept red-hot
by natural-gas burners.    

31
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,141
this keeps the glass mix in a liquid form,       

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,745
as it oozes out of the holes in the bottoms of the channels.

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,084
the melted glass falls about 3 feet into a spinning bowl.  

34
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,420
it's called a fiberizer.    

35
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,088
the spinning action flings the glass        

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,823
through thousands of holes in the bowl,          

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,828
creating thousands of feathery glass fibers.   

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,764
gas and compressed air pull the 
fibers, stretching them thinner.

39
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,369
the process is a lot like making cotton candy,      

40
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,506
and the spun glass even has a similar texture.  

41
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:59,110
but the fibers will soon become
even more like cotton candy.  

42
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:03,048
nozzles spray them       
with a polymer glue tinted pink.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,053
the now-pink and sticky fibers 

44
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,389
drop into a hole in the ground and amass.    

45
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,857
then a conveyer belt      

46
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,861
takes the mounds of sticky glass
to an oven.          

47
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,399
steel plates compress the pack as it enters the oven     

48
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,136
that's heated to 500 degrees fahrenheit.   

49
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,905
hot air blows through it, setting the glue.       

50
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:33,278
as the pack exits the oven, circular saws cut through it, 

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,881
making 15- to 24-inch-wide strips     

52
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,482
that are called lanes.     

53
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:41,820
the lanes pass by a series of poles that push them apart. 

54
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,460
next, an ink jet brands each lane with a number 

55
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,364
that conveys the "r" value.  

56
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,634
"r" stands for "resistance to heat flow."   

57
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,437
it's a measure of how well the insulation will stop heat 

58
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,574
from going through the roof and
your energy bill along with it.

59
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:11,650
a chopper with big steel teeth now cuts the lanes,      

60
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,653
making chunks that could easily be installed 

61
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,588
in an attic or wall.      

62
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,930
after chopping, the conveyer belt accelerates, 

63
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:29,101
transporting the fiberglass batts to the next station.   

64
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,940
a few at a time, the batts plunge down a chute, 

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,942
to a mechanical arm      

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,079
which slides the batts into a compression chamber.  

67
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,482
there, a hydraulic ram squishes the batts down,    

68
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,085
reducing their bulk 5 to 10 times.         

69
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:51,023
this compaction will make them easier to transport.      

70
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,833
now another ram comes from the side      

71
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,436
and pushes the stack of compressed batts forward  

72
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,104
into a spout.         

73
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,973
the spout is a hollow batt-shaped frame. 

74
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,477
a worker pulls a plastic bag over it.  

75
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,982
then the ram pushes the fiberglass-insulation batt 

76
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,918
into the plastic bag,     

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,721
and the process begins again. 

78
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,599
a conveyer belt transports the batt-filled bags

79
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,135
to a machine that heat-seals them.     

80
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,075
then they're sent off to be installed.        

81
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,959
narrator: for centuries, hunters have used wooden ducks 

82
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,628
to lure live ones to within shooting range.   

83
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,765
stringing together decoys and floating them in the water,

84
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,168
hunters trick the birds down from the sky with duck calls. 

85
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,971
nowadays, hunters generally prefer cheaper, plastic decoys.

86
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,409
wooden ducks are mostly decorative items for the home. 

87
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,981
this company's flock includes males, females,    

88
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,983
and androgynous models like this one.         

89
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,985
this more elaborate male is inspired          

90
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,455
by another aquatic bird, the loon.           

91
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,591
to make them, these craftsmen use eastern white pine     

92
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,927
because it's easy to carve and has a nice grain.     

93
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,998
first, a machine shapes a 2-inch-thick slab.      

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,266
they cut the slab lengthwise. 

95
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,003
they'll use four to six of these smaller pieces    

96
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,071
to make most of the duck's body.

97
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,543
the birds range in size from baby ducks just 4 inches long 

98
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,679
to geese at more than 19 inches long.        

99
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,281
a craftsman now applies    

100
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,150
a generous amount of carpenter's glue      

101
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,618
to one side of the wood.    

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,954
using a lot ensures a strong bond     

103
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,890
and prevents splitting later on.

104
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,896
the pieces then go       
into what's called a wood clamp.

105
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,898
he tightens a vice, squeezing them together.    

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,968
it takes about two hours    
for the pieces to bond properly.

107
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,707
then he'll shave away the excess
glue and even up the surfaces. 

108
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,042
once that's done,       

109
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,111
they run the block over what's called a joiner.  

110
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,115
a roller with 3 blades shaves about 3/4 of an inch  

111
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:34,453
from what will become the top and bottom of the duck.

112
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,855
each model has three wooden patterns   

113
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,058
for the top, the bottom, and the profile.        

114
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,194
here, a worker traces the outline of the bird's profile 

115
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,529
in pencil on the wood.     

116
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,264
since this is a small model,  

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,567
he'll make two birds with one block.        

118
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,139
using a band saw, he trims along the trace line. 

119
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,340
this company recycles the cutoffs      

120
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,611
into fireplace kindling and shavings for farm stables. 

121
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,882
next, he uses another pattern to create the top of the bird. 

122
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,417
these patterns provide only the general shape     

123
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,752
of a particular model.     

124
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,155
the craftsman will later carve the details  

125
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,724
using smaller electric tools and by hand.          

126
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,095
now he sands the wood with a pneumatic drum sander --

127
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,900
a tube of pressurized air with sandpaper stretched over it.  

128
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,836
he uses higher pressure for sharper curves,      

129
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,904
lower pressure for softer edges.

130
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,773
to sculpt the bird's plumage, 

131
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,176
the craftsman uses this band sander     

132
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,579
whose rounded edge       
presses sandpaper into the wood.

133
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,981
here, he makes three long grooves --     

134
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,951
one on top, and one on each side of the duck.   

135
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,189
the head's made from a different
piece of wood than the body.  

136
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,993
here, he sands down the piece to smooth out the curves.   

137
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,298
using various shaping tools and the band sander,      

138
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,934
he sculpts the bird's head and bill area,      

139
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,070
then the underside and rear end
of this waddling duck.     

140
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,607
he also carves depressions for eye sockets to come later. 

141
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,014
here, he puts glue on the neck 

142
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,316
to attach it to the rest of the body.    

143
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,686
using a nail gun,       

144
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,956
he reinforces the area with two nails on each side.  

145
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,559
to hide the nails and smooth out the neck,    

146
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,561
the craftsman uses wood putty. 

147
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,130
once it dries, he'll sand it smooth.     

148
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,369
next, he tints the duck bill using an orange wood stain... 

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,175
...then a forest-green stain  
to tint the head and neck areas.

150
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,511
males have colorful feathers to better attract mates.    

151
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,714
females have more neutral colors    

152
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,183
to blend into their surroundings
and protect their ducklings.  

153
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,653
the craftsman covers the duck's lower body  

154
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,188
with a clear wood stain.    

155
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,591
this way, the natural grain of the wood shows through.   

156
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,261
the front gets a clear but darker stain to mark the chest.

157
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,132
and darker stain also highlights
the plumage in the long grooves.

158
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,868
then, some green accents for the feathers        

159
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,470
on the sides in the back.   

160
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:13,878
next, two coats of white paint to mark the duck's collar.   

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,348
then he glues plastic eyes in the eye sockets.      

162
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,619
the irises are black, brown, or red, depending on the model.

163
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,756
he then sprays on a protective,
water-based varnish,      

164
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,757
and elevates the duck on nails 

165
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,894
so that the underside will dry along with the rest.      

166
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,498
finally, the craftsman rubs the entire carving in wood wax.

167
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,434
this makes the varnish appear uneven in places,    

168
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,037
giving the duck a worn, antique finish,    

169
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,840
like he's been around the pond a few times.  

170
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:49,046
the prices of wooden ducks vary
according to size and detail. 

171
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,117
$500 will buy you this magnificent canada goose 

172
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,720
with wings stretched and ready for a graceful landing.    

173
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,663
narrator: for a century,         

174
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,066
there have been machines to give us gumballs.      

175
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:12,536
vending machines that dispensed 
gumballs were introduced in 1907

176
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,206
on a new york city subway platform.        

177
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,810
today's machines are more modern
versions of the originals,   

178
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,147
but they still perform, basically, the same function. 

179
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,488
the gumball machine is all about
instant gratification.     

180
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,526
insert a coin, turn a handle, and out comes the merchandise. 

181
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,897
to make a gumball machine,   

182
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,233
a designer first sketches out the exact proportions.     

183
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,173
then, a worker ladles molten zinc into a holding furnace,  

184
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,442
where a steel plunger pushes the metal        

185
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:54,578
through a die that forms a gumball machine base.     

186
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,649
a mechanical claw removes the newly shaped base from the die 

187
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,087
and places it on a conveyor belt to cool.  

188
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,057
a similar die shapes      

189
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,327
the coin mechanism handle and drive gears.        

190
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,800
a worker places a braided hose with a natural-gas flame    

191
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,671
under a mold that will shape the gumball-dispensing chute. 

192
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,543
he pours piping-hot liquid aluminum into the mold. 

193
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,879
the flame below warms the mold enough to prevent condensation,

194
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,347
which would ruin the shape.  

195
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,950
but the mold is still cooler than the aluminum,       

196
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,821
and that allows it to solidify into a chute shape in seconds. 

197
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,427
now, using a punch press, a worker trims the waste away 

198
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,029
from the lid for the gumball machine.    

199
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,968
they also trim the front plate of the coin mechanism,     

200
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,271
using a similar press.     

201
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,379
a computerized cutter mills out
a hole in the top of the globe 

202
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,114
that will hold the gumballs.  

203
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,617
the globe is made of shatterproof plastic.    

204
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,858
at another station,      

205
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
they press the base of the gumball machine     

206
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,062
against a cloth-covered buffing wheel 

207
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,265
to give it a shine.      

208
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,269
a worker now assembles the coin mechanism,      

209
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,338
layering the front plate, the coin carrier,       

210
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,941
the back plate, and ending with a cam,     

211
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:35,880
the part that ensures the coin mechanism moves clockwise.

212
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,682
she screws it tightly together,

213
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,485
then inserts the handle on the front plate.      

214
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,888
the handle will turn the coins that pay for the gumballs.   

215
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,961
she places a little spacer and drive gear on the handle stem  

216
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,696
that protrudes through the back
of the assembly        

217
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,667
and then screws the drive gear onto the handle stem.     

218
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,572
now it's time to put the money up front.   

219
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,507
they insert a coin in the slot 

220
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,476
and turn the handle to make sure the system works. 

221
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,983
people in many countries like gumballs,         

222
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,586
and so these coin mechanisms  
can be made to accept currencies

223
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,055
from around the world.     

224
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:20,558
they can also be used in other types of vending machines.   

225
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,932
now they spray powder paint onto the lids,         

226
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,268
giving them a coating that's almost 1/16 of an inch thick. 

227
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,271
they bake the paint onto the lids         

228
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:37,742
at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 25 minutes.        

229
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,477
now it's time to put all the pieces together.

230
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,147
they place the dispensing wheels
in hoppers,          

231
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,350
then cover them with a part that stops free gumballs    

232
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,885
from spilling out.       

233
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,955
the next part is the adaptor ring,      

234
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,425
and the plastic globes fit on top of them.      

235
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,232
they place aluminum rings on top of the globes.     

236
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,501
then they slide two side rods through the top rings,     

237
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,838
down into the bottom of the globes.         

238
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,774
they screw them down very tightly,         

239
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,810
and then they set the assembly aside.      

240
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,515
now they place plastic bodies on bases    

241
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,118
and install the chute doors on the front.         

242
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,559
they place the chute covers in the plastic body...     

243
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,565
...and mount the coin mechanism
just above the chute.     

244
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,470
next, they slide the globe assemblies      

245
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,342
over center rods and onto the plastic foundations. 

246
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,945
they put a lid on every globe...

247
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,948
and then lock them on.     

248
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,091
and now we're at the vending part of the story. 

249
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,926
gumball, anyone?        

250
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,235
narrator: the job it does is exhausting. 

251
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,105
the exhaust system on your vehicle        

252
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,108
gets rid of harmful gases that could damage the engine. 

253
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,909
it also cleans up the gases a bit        

254
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,178
before venting them into the air.         

255
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,848
a properly functioning exhaust system does another big job -- 

256
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,452
muffling the airborne noise of the engine.         

257
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,326
it's a system of metal tubes and plates   

258
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,795
we only seem to notice when it breaks down.      

259
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,131
and when it does, everyone can hear it.     

260
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,068
to make an exhaust system,   

261
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,271
a mechanical puller draws a stainless-steel strip    

262
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,739
up into a punch press,     

263
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,076
shuffling it back and forth to allow for a precise cut   

264
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,678
with little waste.       

265
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,886
the press brings 60 tons of force to bear        

266
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,088
as it pushes the steel into a die.          

267
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,758
it punches out a baffle shape with holes in it,       

268
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,762
which will form the skeleton for the muffler box.      

269
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,031
the finished baffles fall onto a conveyor      

270
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,267
and go into a storage cage.  

271
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,506
now a long steel tube tumbles to automated blades  

272
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,776
which score the tube crosswise to prevent denting       

273
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,778
and then cut it to produce smaller tubes    

274
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,446
that go inside a muffler.   

275
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,049
a circular saw descends on another tube        

276
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,451
to make a tail pipe.      

277
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:38,723
its length depends on the type of muffler being made.

278
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,259
a louver machine spins and punctures      

279
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,794
one of the inside tubes.    

280
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,997
the holes will regulate airflow
in the muffler.        

281
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,533
a cnc bending machine     

282
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,069
grips and bends a pipe in several spots.       

283
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,940
this is how they make inlet, intermediate, and outlet tubes.

284
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,077
these tubes run the length of the exhaust system.     

285
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,086
then they place a tube in a circular hydraulic vice, 

286
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,023
which pinches the end down to a prescribed diameter    

287
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,991
to allow for further assembly.     

288
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,229
a worker now places two baffles
in a jig.           

289
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,966
he fits the tubes       
through the holes in the baffles

290
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,202
so that the tubes connect the baffles.      

291
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,439
three mandrels slide into the tubes.     

292
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,176
the mandrels expand, locking the tubes to the baffles.   

293
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,711
then they contract and slide out.         

294
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,582
now the baffles and tubes are one piece.         

295
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,053
next, a robotic arm picks up metal sheets,     

296
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,923
which will become the outer skin
of the muffler box.      

297
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,726
it pushes them under an oval mold.      

298
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,862
another arm with numerous rollers on it  

299
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,733
moves up and wraps the steel around the oval form.     

300
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,668
then a metal block moves over the ends,      

301
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,203
double-folding them.      

302
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,805
this locks them together,   

303
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,941
and it completes the assembly of the muffler's outside skin. 

304
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,019
magnets pick up the new skin, and, sliding on rails,     

305
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,688
they relay it to a mechanical claw      

306
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,857
which, in turn, feeds it to a flanger.     

307
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,495
the flanger bends the edges,  

308
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,732
creating a lip on either end of the muffler skin.      

309
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,366
a carousel turns,       

310
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,970
and a mechanical claw transfers
the newly flanged muffler skin 

311
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,405
to the stuffing position.   

312
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,913
hydraulic pushers press the pre-assembled baffles and tubes

313
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,316
inside the skin.        

314
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,318
after the muffler is stuffed, 

315
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,022
the robotic claw transfers it to a conveyor belt.      

316
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,461
next, a worker presses each end
of the muffler         

317
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:00,464
against a set of steel expansion fingers.  

318
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,467
the fingers move forward into holes in the muffler.   

319
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,337
they expand and lock the baffles and tubes inside  

320
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,974
to form one solid, internal unit.         

321
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,609
grippers place the muffler   

322
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,979
on a spinning machine that will fasten the caps on. 

323
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,886
rollers press against the flared
edges of the revolving muffler, 

324
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,957
tightly locking the end cap to the rest of the body.    

325
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,365
here, you see the rolling in slow motion.        

326
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,703
it takes only a few revolutions
to do the job.         

327
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,450
then the roller backs away,  

328
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,920
and a mechanical arm grabs the muffler       

329
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,322
and transfers it to a conveyor belt.      

330
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,261
now these mufflers are ready  

331
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,030
to help keep the traffic noise at a minimum.         

332
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,805
