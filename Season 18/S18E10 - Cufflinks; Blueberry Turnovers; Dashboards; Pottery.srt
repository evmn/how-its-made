    discovery communications

00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:55,788
            narrator:           
  cufflinks are a fashion trend 
  with definite staying power.  

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,792
they've been holding shirt cuffs
together since the 17th century.

5
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:03,195
   early versions were buttons  
     linked by short chains,    

6
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,464
 an improvement over the ribbons
            and pins            

7
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,400
    the gentleman of the day    
         had been using         

8
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,436
    to fasten their sleeves.    

9
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,740
    clothes may make the man,   

10
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,809
     but a set of cufflinks     
      can make the outfit.      

11
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:19,612
     they add a bit of flash    
  to conservative business garb 

12
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:21,546
 and convey a sense of occasion.

13
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,948
     buttons may be easier,     

14
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,618
     but cufflinks are about    
       taking the trouble       

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,486
     to look really spiffy.     

16
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,622
  a pair of high-end cufflinks  

17
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:33,426
  starts with sterling silver,  
       gold, or platinum.       

18
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,561
  a craftsman cuts out blanks.  

19
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,364
    these blanks will be used   
for the fronts of the cufflinks.

20
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:42,034
          he places one         
  of the silver blanks on a die 

21
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,103
    engraved with a recessed    
          grid pattern.         

22
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,172
    a hydraulic press closes    
  and squeezes the silver blank 

23
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,440
          into the die,         

24
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,843
    transferring the pattern    
        onto the silver.        

25
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,046
   this company has more than   
    1,000 cufflink patterns,    

26
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,715
   some of which date back to   
      the mid-19th century.     

27
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,184
        with these dies,        

28
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,854
   they continue to handcraft   
 cufflinks the traditional way. 

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,522
      pressing the pattern      
         onto the silver        

30
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,524
 has caused the metal to expand,

31
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,327
     so he trims the excess     
       from the perimeter.      

32
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,128
there's another benefit to this.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,399
  the trimming works the silver 
         to harden it...        

34
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,934
    from a plain silver blank   

35
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,805
       to a cufflink face       
    with artistic expression.   

36
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,142
   a craftsperson now attaches  
          a silver stem         

37
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,010
 to the back of a cufflink face.

38
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,680
     he melts silver solder     
        between the two,        

39
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:30,149
        and, as it cools,       
    it creates a solid bond.    

40
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,885
         the stem shape         
   is a slightly curved design  

41
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,423
      to allow the cufflink     
   to sit perfectly on a cuff.  

42
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:42,028
  the soldering torch oxidizes  
and darkens the silver slightly,

43
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,097
      so he dips the parts      
    in a sulfuric-acid bath.    

44
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,032
  the acid pulls out the black, 

45
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,169
      and the parts become      
    silvery white once again.   

46
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,573
    next, the brass bristles    
      of a revolving wheel      

47
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,709
       make tiny scratches      
          on the silver         

48
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,844
  to brighten it substantially. 

49
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,714
   each cufflink now undergoes  
   a very intensive enameling   

50
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,919
  using a mix of finely ground  
    colored glass and water.    

51
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,522
       here, the enamelist      
       applies blue glass       

52
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:12,058
        to the cufflink's       
     stamped grid detailing     

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,927
     and then paints yellow     
     around the perimeter.      

54
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,395
     it takes a steady hand     
         and experience         

55
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,264
       to do an even job.       

56
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,600
       if one color bleeds      
         into the next,         

57
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,868
       it can't be fixed,       

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,403
    and she'll have to scrap    
  this cufflink and start anew. 

59
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,473
      then it's into a kiln     

60
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,742
     fired to 1,800 degrees     
           fahrenheit.          

61
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,343
    the heat melts the glass,   

62
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,346
 and it flows into the detailing
     to give it definition.     

63
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:40,018
   at the same time, the glass  
   fuses to the metal surface.  

64
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,090
and then it's back to the artist
   for another layer of glass.  

65
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,226
    the enameler will repeat    
          this process          

66
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,894
  between three and seven times 

67
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,698
   to produce a perfect luster  
       and depth of color.      

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,367
        the color deepens       
        with each layer,        

69
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:59,805
    and the result is a rich,   
   translucent enamel surface.  

70
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,912
        leaving the kiln,       
    the enamel is a bit wavy,   

71
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,714
   so the worker files it down  

72
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,517
        until the surface       
  is completely flat and level. 

73
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,724
 then the cufflinks go back into
  the kiln for one last firing. 

74
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:22,127
he polishes the enameled surface
   against an abrasive wheel,   

75
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,798
   using a mix of volcanic ash  
and water for a polishing paste.

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,466
        this takes hours,       

77
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,337
  but it gives the glass enamel 
        a glossy finish.        

78
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,939
      now the focus returns     
      to the cufflink stem      

79
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,142
          and the dome          
      spring link fittings      

80
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,544
that are the closing mechanisms.

81
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:42,014
   he heats a needle-thin wire  
   to make it slightly pliable  

82
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:44,883
     and then pushes it into    
 the fitting to engage a spring 

83
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,019
          that attaches         
      to the cufflink stem.     

84
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,820
   with the fitting installed,  

85
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,657
    he clips the excess wire    
          at both ends.         

86
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,628
   to secure the installation,  

87
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,297
 he hammers the ends of the wire
       to flare them out,       

88
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,766
          turning them          
      into a kind of rivet.     

89
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:06,906
  with the fitting now solidly  
 attached to the cufflink stem, 

90
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:09,374
   he lightly files the edges   
       with an emery board      

91
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,511
        to give the part        
   a perfectly smooth finish.   

92
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:16,248
     he buffs the cufflinks'    
         exposed silver         

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,049
      against a cloth wheel     

94
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:22,054
   and uses a polishing agent   
    to make it really gleam.    

95
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,523
    after at least six hours    
            of work,            

96
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,526
 these enameled silver cufflinks
        are now complete.       

97
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,994
     in the business world,     

98
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,330
     where men usually dress    
       in a suit and tie,       

99
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,601
  a custom set of cufflinks is  
one way to express individuality

100
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:39,071
        but still fit in        
   with the rest of the guys.   

101
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:57,089
   narrator: a fruit turnover   
   is probably your best bet    

102
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,557
   if you're eating on the go.  

103
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,360
   it satisfies a sweet tooth,  
         it's portable,         

104
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,428
  and it requires no utensils.  

105
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,565
   the dough, typically flaky,  
         is folded over,        

106
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,101
     usually into a triangle    
          or rectangle,         

107
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,702
    and the edges are sealed,   

108
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,438
   trapping the fruit filling   
         neatly inside.         

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,709
        these all-natural       
       blueberry turnovers      

110
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,111
       may look and taste       
         like homemade,         

111
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,314
     but, believe it or not,    
   they come frozen in a box.   

112
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,516
you just bake them and eat them.

113
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:28,320
   the manufacturer is willing  
   to reveal the ingredients,   

114
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,323
  but the critical proportions, 
    mixing, and heating times   

115
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,925
         are top-secret.        

116
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:38,330
workers begin making the filling
     by heating blueberries.    

117
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:42,635
 next, they combine lemon juice 
  and starch in a container...  

118
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,074
    ...then add this mixture    
       to the blueberries.      

119
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:54,046
the starch is white now but will
become transparent as it cooks. 

120
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,954
      they mix some more...     

121
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,757
         then add salt.         

122
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:11,497
   when the starch is opaque,   
        they add sugar...       

123
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,766
       and mix some more.       

124
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,370
   as soon as the temperature   
       of the ingredients       

125
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:23,575
 reaches 170 degrees fahrenheit,
      the filling is done.      

126
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,243
       to make the dough,       

127
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:30,849
    workers first pour flour    
   into the mixer, then salt.   

128
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,923
 after a few minutes of mixing, 
       they add butter --       

129
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,191
         lots of butter.        

130
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,396
     once it's well-blended,    
      they add some water.      

131
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,733
    after a bit more mixing,    
       the dough is ready.      

132
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,069
       this type of dough       
    is called "pâte brisée,"    

133
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:52,338
         the french term        
    for a butter-based pastry   

134
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,873
that's extremely light and flaky

135
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,209
      due to its high ratio     
        of fat to flour.        

136
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,613
      now workers weigh out     
      12-pound portions...      

137
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:06,552
 ...and put them, one at a time,
       into a dough press       

138
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:10,889
   with a sprinkling of flour   
      to prevent sticking.      

139
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,626
 the press compresses the dough 
      into a 10"x16" block      

140
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,929
     that's one inch thick.     

141
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,105
  then they line up the blocks  
  on a floured conveyor belt,   

142
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:31,309
 joining them together to form  
 one continuous sheet of dough. 

143
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,980
         the dough sheet        
       now enters a press.      

144
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,049
    inside, rollers compress    
            the sheet           

145
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:40,785
       to about a quarter       
   of its original thickness.   

146
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,023
        the next machine        
  layers the thin dough sheet.  

147
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,328
        this flour press        
        and layer process       

148
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,062
   repeats over and over again  

149
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,832
         until the sheet        
       is just 1/10" thick      

150
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,402
     yet contains 24 layers.    

151
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,937
          these layers          
  are what will make the pastry 

152
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,607
 exceptionally light and flaky. 

153
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:06,078
  trimming wheels on the sides  
        make a neat edge.       

154
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:11,150
 diagonally bladed wheels score 
   the dough with small cuts.   

155
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:14,486
    and cutting wheels divide   
   the sheet into five strips,  

156
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:18,090
    each of which will become   
       a row of turnovers.      

157
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,692
    the next station deposits   
    a line of water droplets    

158
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,295
  along one edge of each strip. 

159
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,964
       this creates a line      
        of sticky dough.        

160
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,835
 the preparations are all done, 
     and assembly can begin.    

161
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,171
 first, with precision spacing, 

162
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,774
   nozzles squirt one ounce of  
 blueberry filling per turnover.

163
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,845
          then a device         
     called a folding plow,     

164
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,114
      because it looks like     
          a farm plow,          

165
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,717
  lifts one edge of the dough   
  and gradually folds it over.  

166
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,323
         a smooth wheel         
   then presses that edge down  

167
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,325
      onto the sticky line      
       on the other edge.       

168
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,929
    this seals the open side    
         of the strips.         

169
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,732
    the culinary choreography   
        ends with a bang,       

170
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,934
       or, rather, a chop,      

171
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,801
    as a guillotine descends,   

172
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,005
       cutting the strips       
    into individual turnovers   

173
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,741
   and simultaneously sealing   
     the front and back ends    

174
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,277
         of each pastry.        

175
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,417
     the assembled turnovers    
    now go on a 6-minute ride   

176
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,819
       through a nitrogen       
     flash-freezing tunnel.     

177
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,756
         temperature --         
    -183 degrees fahrenheit.    

178
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,359
         under a shower         
       of sugar crystals,       

179
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,762
  they exit the tunnel frozen,  
         hard as a rock.        

180
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:39,037
     packaged four to a box,    
   the turnovers remain frozen  

181
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,474
until you bake them in your oven
       and serve them up.       

182
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,058
   narrator: a car's dashboard  
   is full of dials and gauges  

183
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,861
      that keep the driver      
   up to speed on everything.   

184
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,063
           in the time          
     of the horse and buggy,    

185
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,665
 a dashboard was a wooden panel 

186
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,201
    for shielding the driver    
       from mud and water,      

187
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,869
     hence the word "dash,"     

188
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,072
   which can mean "bespatter,"  
          or "splash."          

189
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,879
     when motorized vehicles    
           came along,          

190
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,481
     instruments were added,    

191
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,083
     making the dashboard an    
important source of information.

192
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:29,221
     today's dashboards tell    
  the driver a lot at a glance. 

193
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,491
   ignore the indicator dials,  
  and you could run out of fuel 

194
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:35,227
          or be slapped         
     with a speeding ticket.    

195
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,429
           a dashboard          
     for a luxury sports car    

196
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,631
             starts             
  with this aluminum skeleton.  

197
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,900
 it's been bonded at the joints 
          with adhesive         

198
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:45,036
         that's stronger        
    than conventional welds.    

199
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,240
       a technician clips       
   the main electrical harness  

200
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,708
     to the aluminum frame.     

201
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,111
    he then fixes the heating   
    and air-conditioning unit   

202
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,113
          to the center         
    of the dashboard skeleton   

203
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,816
 and connects it to the wiring. 

204
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,789
      at the next station,      

205
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,258
    the dashboard's composite   
substructure is coming together.

206
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,594
     working from the back,     

207
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:11,129
     the technician installs    
           a glove box          

208
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:16,001
   and a network of ducts for   
 the heating and cooling system.

209
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,972
the substructure is now ready to
 join the wired aluminum frame. 

210
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,543
     he rivets the assembly     
     to the metal structure.    

211
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,079
      he slots the driver's     
       information module,      

212
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,883
 which includes the speedometer,
        into the housing.       

213
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:37,289
     he equips the dashboard    
     with high-end speakers.    

214
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,226
   the front-passenger airbag,  
encased in aluminum, comes next.

215
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:45,230
    the technician inserts it   
  in the molded plastic niche.  

216
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,499
   using a computerized tool,   

217
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,503
     he installs the airbag     
     with perfect precision.    

218
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,571
 next up is the steering column,

219
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,573
       with its magnesium       
        shifting paddles        

220
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,642
       and wiper controls       
       already attached.        

221
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,513
  he slides it into place just  
  under the information module. 

222
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:05,050
 he then encases the electronics
      with plastic cowling.     

223
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,854
  this both protects the wiring 
   and tucks it out of sight.   

224
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:12,124
      he tops off this job      
    with more cowling above.    

225
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,396
     he adds a hand-stitched    
        leather surround        

226
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,199
       to the dashboard's       
         center console.        

227
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,536
  he inserts the center stack,  
    which contains the radio,   

228
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,004
     other audio equipment,     

229
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,539
     and temperature-control    
           mechanisms.          

230
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,475
        more leather adds       
    a luxurious look, smell,    

231
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,145
     and feel to the cabin.     

232
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,747
       the next technician      
 assembles push-button controls 

233
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,783
       for shifting gears.      

234
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,354
        he installs them        
      in a veneered fascia      

235
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,488
        through the back        

236
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,491
        to avoid damaging       
 the glossy finish on the front.

237
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,361
        he inserts vents        
for air conditioning and heating

238
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,029
 above the gear-shift controls, 

239
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,700
  again sliding them into place 
  through the back of the unit. 

240
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,837
      he secures the vents      
          with screws,          

241
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:04,709
 then adds the starter assembly.

242
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,245
 the satellite navigation system
       gets the top spot,       

243
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,247
        which will put it       
      within easy eye shot      

244
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,784
once installed in the dashboard.

245
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:16,053
      with the subassembly      
        almost complete,        

246
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,322
       he flips it around.      

247
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,191
 it needs one finishing touch --

248
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,327
    a chrome and glass casing   
        for the starter.        

249
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,928
    he slides it into place,    

250
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,665
    and the unit is now ready   
       for the dashboard.       

251
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,603
            he makes            
    all the right connections   

252
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,538
          and installs          
    the gadget-filled fascia    

253
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,207
   just over the center stack.  

254
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,145
         he now encases         
    the rest of the dashboard   

255
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,346
      in leather paneling.      

256
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,882
      this particular panel     
      has a built-in split,     

257
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,018
         so it will part        
     if the airbag deploys.     

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,288
       next, a technician       
   downloads computer software  

259
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,690
      for all the equipment     
        in the dashboard.       

260
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,628
  he configures the electronics 
  to the appropriate settings.  

261
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,696
  he then tests each component, 

262
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,834
confirming that every instrument
  and control works perfectly.  

263
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:08,240
    this dashboard now joins    
         all the others,        

264
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,975
    ready to take their place   

265
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,643
          in the front          
     of a luxury sports car.    

266
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,781
  a modern dashboard can define 
     a car's interior space     

267
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,851
 and add serious gadget appeal. 

268
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,587
      for example, this car     
       uses a distinctive       

269
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,957
      steel and crystal key     
    for the engine ignition.    

270
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,196
  when the key slot glows red,  
         there's power.         

271
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,799
it's time to press a few buttons
      and see what pops up,     

272
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,602
 like this speaker, for example.

273
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,339
        with a high-tech,       
        luxury dashboard,       

274
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,775
   a driver can really travel   
            in style.           

275
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,493
        narrator: pottery       
      is the catch-all term     

276
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,095
     to describe decorative     
     or functional objects      

277
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,564
        formed from clay,       

278
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:09,033
   then fired in a large oven   
         called a kiln.         

279
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,036
           the pottery          
    is then usually painted.    

280
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,304
   there are several different  
        types of pottery,       

281
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,508
  such as porcelain, stoneware, 
        and earthenware.        

282
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,247
      earthenware produced      
        on a larger scale       

283
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,783
   is typically cast in molds.  

284
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,919
          this longtime         
      british manufacturer      

285
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,721
     is famous for its bold     
    floral and fruit designs    

286
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,725
   that feature raised lines.   

287
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:34,992
         at the factory,        

288
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,529
      the moldmaker creates     
    a plaster of paris model    

289
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,464
    of the piece on a lathe,    

290
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:43,468
       verifying the shape      
 and dimensions with a profile. 

291
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,605
   he uses the model to cast    
   a two-part production mold   

292
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,339
      also out of plaster,      

293
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,142
        the model shaping       
        the mold cavity.        

294
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,680
    a caster takes that mold    

295
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,884
and fills it with liquefied clay
         called "slip."         

296
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:02,086
      once a layer hardens      
     along the cavity wall,     

297
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,089
        he tips the mold        
    and pours out the excess.   

298
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,824
    it takes tremendous skill   

299
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:12,030
     to know how long to let    
  the clay set before tipping.  

300
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,231
       in about two hours,      

301
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,034
    the clay inside the mold    
      hardens sufficiently      

302
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,570
     to be safely extracted.    

303
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,239
  the caster now puts the piece 

304
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,307
       into what they call      
         the damp room.         

305
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,111
        there, overnight,       
        in 100% humidity,       

306
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,980
     the clay fully hardens.    

307
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,983
   it can now be safely worked  
           on a lathe.          

308
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,251
using specialized turning tools,

309
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,853
   a highly skilled craftsman   

310
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,256
  applies just the right degree 
        of light pressure       

311
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,992
        to form the piece       
      to the final shape --     

312
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,162
   in this case, a ginger jar.  

313
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,934
         after applying         
    the manufacturer's stamp,   

314
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,203
        he mounts the jar       
       on a potter's wheel      

315
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,339
       and, pressing with       
       a wet sea sponge,        

316
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,575
      smooths the surface.      

317
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,212
       a designer creates       
    the decoration on paper,    

318
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:04,282
        then sketches it        
       onto a sample jar.       

319
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,288
   then she traces her design   
      onto clear cellophane     

320
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,223
          and indicates         
      with red marker lines     

321
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:16,394
   where the cellophane bends   
         around the jar.        

322
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,638
           an artisan           
    now takes that cellophane   

323
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,841
   and traces the design with   
   a specially designed ink.    

324
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,650
   using the red contour marks  
           as a guide,          

325
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,586
   another artisan positions    
   and presses the cellophane   

326
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,588
 against the jar to be painted. 

327
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,958
    this transfers the design   
    onto the surface in ink.    

328
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,934
     the ink will disappear     
    once the piece is fired.    

329
00:18:55,936 --> 00:19:00,871
 next, she creates the design's 
     signature raised lines.    

330
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,341
          the technique         
    is called "tube lining."    

331
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,144
    she traces the ink lines    
      while squeezing slip      

332
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,012
     through a tiny nozzle.     

333
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,748
 she uses her artistic judgment 

334
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,017
       to tweak the design      
          if necessary.         

335
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,953
     not only does this work    
     require a steady hand,     

336
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,556
      she must also squeeze     
       with even pressure       

337
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,825
   to keep the line thickness   
           consistent.          

338
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,295
 the jar goes into a controlled 
      drying room overnight     

339
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,531
      and, from there, into     
 the skilled hands of a painter.

340
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,168
  with a large artist's brush,  

341
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,971
  she applies just a tiny drop  
        of watery paint.        

342
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,040
    then, with another touch    
          of the brush,         

343
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,143
 she soaks up the excess paint. 

344
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:45,016
  she uses her finger to gently 
    blend color transitions.    

345
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,456
      the jar is now ready      
    to be fired in the kiln.    

346
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,458
     the heating phase lasts    
          eight hours,          

347
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,393
          during which          
      the temperature peaks     

348
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,595
  at 2,000 degrees fahrenheit.  

349
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,998
       this cures the clay      
and triggers a chemical reaction

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,133
          in the paint,         

351
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,804
      which produces rich,      
         vibrant colors.        

352
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,338
    after a 16-hour cooldown,   

353
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,740
        they take the jar       
         out of the kiln        

354
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:14,012
    and submerge it in glaze,   
 which contains powdered glass. 

355
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,147
   they coat the painted clay   
       surface thoroughly       

356
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,015
         inside and out.        

357
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,084
      once the glaze dries,     

358
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,287
     it's back into the kiln    
      for a second firing,      

359
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,226
this one overnight at just above
    2,000 degrees fahrenheit.   

360
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,961
       the powdered glass       
      and the glaze melts,      

361
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:34,299
   forming a solid glass layer  
 over the painted clay surface. 

362
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:38,303
  this seals the earthenware so 
  that it's no longer absorbent 

363
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,439
     and therefore capable      
     of containing liquids.     

364
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,710
  this, of course, is essential 
    for a vase or dinnerware.   

365
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,379
        glaze also makes        
      the surface shinier,      

366
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,116
     highlighting the beauty    
         of the artwork.
