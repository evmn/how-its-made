narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,427
trucks -- we'll tell you haul
[all]

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,763
you need to know about them.

6
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,898
adhesive bandages --

7
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:38,035
we'll stick to the facts
in this report.

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,038
computer circuit boards --

9
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,641
letting the chips fall
where they may.

10
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,909
and liquor --

11
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,245
we distill the whole process
for you.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,389
whether your rig of choice
rides on 8, 10, or 18 wheels,

13
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,658
trucks have got the goods,

14
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,660
and they get them
to where they have to go.

15
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,465
trucks not only transport
most of today's consumables,

16
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,202
they're the undisputed kings
of the road.

17
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,942
fabricating these massive trucks

18
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:21,678
requires many
highly complex steps

19
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,815
since the parts are usually
heavy and tricky to handle.

20
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,417
assembly begins
with the fabrication

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,753
of the bearing frame,

22
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,422
the main part on which
the truck's cab, motor,

23
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,357
and transmission will rest.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,427
they begin by assembling
these tempered-steel stringers,

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,499
beams varying in length
between 25 and 43 feet.

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,242
the chassis is made
as a huge meccano set.

27
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,712
the stringers are solidly
attached together

28
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,180
with nuts and bolts

29
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,350
and tightened with powerful
pneumatic tools.

30
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:08,459
once assembled,
the main chassis is transported

31
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,862
to another stage
of construction.

32
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,602
now they're going to install
the mechanical parts.

33
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,207
they start
with the differential,

34
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,011
the axle,
and the springs' leaves.

35
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,747
the brake mounts
are then put in place.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,317
the plates installed in the
mounts allow the truck to brake.

37
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,155
they install the wheel hub

38
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,359
onto which the wheels
will be attached.

39
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,961
then the transmission shaft,

40
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,298
which will power
the driving wheels, is inserted.

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,369
they finish
the rear-wheel assembly

42
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:57,441
by mounting the heavy brake drum
made of cast iron.

43
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,710
to facilitate the mounting,

44
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,046
everything is assembled
upside down.

45
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,316
with an overhead crane capable
of lifting a 26,000-pound load,

46
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,854
they then turn the part
right-side up.

47
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,659
next step,
the motor-propulsion elements.

48
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:18,328
the transmission is bolted to
the motor, seen here in yellow.

49
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,064
the motor-propelling elements

50
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,266
comprise the clutch
and the transmission,

51
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,603
installed at the front end
of the truck chassis.

52
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:29,473
a truck has between 6 and 10
wheels 22 inches in diameter.

53
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:34,212
the tire and wheel together
weigh about 120 pounds.

54
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,013
because of this heavy weight,

55
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,217
the wheels are installed with
the help of this powerful tool.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,087
this bolt fastener allows
tightening of all the wheel nuts

57
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,354
at the same time.

58
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,957
the mechanical part is ended,

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
and they now proceed
with the cab assembly.

60
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,763
this begins with painting.

61
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,703
the cab is moved
toward the front

62
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,407
to facilitate the installation
of various components.

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,447
this worker attaches
the support for the horn

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,515
to the roof of the truck cab.

65
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,657
now for the cab's interior.

66
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,060
they begin by installing
the dashboard,

67
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,995
which weighs about 80 pounds.

68
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,065
following this,
they attach all the wires,

69
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,736
the turn indicators,
the speedometer, and the pedals.

70
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,143
the seats are then installed.

71
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,282
the cab work
is now all completed.

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,952
it is bolted onto the chassis.

73
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,357
now for the motor's hood.

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,092
they finish off with the lights,

75
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,862
the exhaust pipe,
and the mudguards.

76
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,101
the truck is now almost ready
to hit the road.

77
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,705
they start it up and verify that
everything's operating properly.

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:11,575
and it's now ready
for delivery to the customer.

79
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,185
it requires
95 to 100 hours of work

80
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,588
to assemble a truck like this.

81
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,861
in spite of their
11,000-pound weight,

82
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,663
these trucks can move along

83
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,999
at a top speed
of 75 miles per hour,

84
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,837
and they can carry a load
of some 30 tons.

85
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,680
narrator:
cut your finger?

86
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,817
well, you've got a couple
of first-aid options.

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,419
you can wrap it up
in bulky gauze

88
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,889
or you can apply a flexible
adhesive bandage.

89
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,825
if you're like most people,
you'll take the bandage

90
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,696
and save the gauze for your
mummy costume next halloween --

91
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,998
from boo-boo to boo.

92
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,239
adhesive bandages are made
of various materials,

93
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,843
among which is the main support
called e.t.s. --

94
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,713
a fabric that's elastic
in only one direction.

95
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,448
it's a fabric that will become

96
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,384
the adhesive portion
of the bandage.

97
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,852
this 6,000-foot roll of fabric

98
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,922
can make 1.8 million
small bandages

99
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,458
or 300,000 large bandages.

100
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,660
a thin coating of glue
is applied

101
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,462
to one surface of the fabric.

102
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,665
then it's heated
to 120 degrees in an oven

103
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,868
to puff it up, creating holes
in the glue coating.

104
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,004
then the fabric
is newly rolled up

105
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,939
into around 1,000-foot lengths.

106
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,809
bandages are different sizes.

107
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:56,580
these blades cut the glued rolls
into strips of varying widths.

108
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,153
these rolls are taken away
and stacked,

109
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,753
ready for the next step --

110
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:10,227
application of the little
cushioned protective pads.

111
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,430
the material used for the pads
is shown here

112
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,768
as a large roll of fabric
which will have to be cut.

113
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,771
here, a machine
cuts the fabric pads.

114
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,373
these extremely sharp blades
have to be sharpened

115
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,643
every six months.

116
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,516
the cushioned fabric is
separated into narrow strips

117
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,254
which will later be glued
to the e.t.s. fabric.

118
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,122
the strips of cushioned fabric

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,926
are now ready to be applied
to the bandages.

120
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,331
this is the machine
that fabricates the bandages.

121
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,934
the roll of bandage components
is unrolled.

122
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,668
the machine assembles them,

123
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,371
then cuts
and individually wraps them.

124
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,747
the bandages are wrapped
one by one.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,951
this machine applies the
unprinted white wrapping paper

126
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,353
that protects the bandages.

127
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,821
and now they proceed
to packaging.

128
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,224
packaging speed depends
on the product,

129
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,262
varying between 300
and 1,500 bandages a minute.

130
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,568
this roller perforates holes
that allow the bandages

131
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,371
to be easily separated
from one another.

132
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,907
strips of bandages
are then placed into boxes.

133
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,377
here we see other small bandages

134
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,679
that are made
in a different way.

135
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,317
the cushioned strip
is positioned

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,621
at the center of the e.t.s.
fabric strip.

137
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,393
the cushioned pad isn't sterile
at this stage.

138
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,061
they will have to be sterilized

139
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,198
right at the end
of the fabrication process.

140
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,334
next step, applying two
plastic paper protectors

141
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,404
over the glue-covered ends
of the bandage.

142
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:06,409
this done, the bandage is drawn
by suction with a robotic arm

143
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,812
and placed between
two wrapping papers.

144
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,616
in slow motion, we see
the wrapping action better.

145
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,285
this machine is much faster
than the eye.

146
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,290
at full speed, it can wrap
300 bandages a minute.

147
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,631
the bandages exit the machine
perfectly wrapped.

148
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,568
certain types of bandages

149
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,437
have to go through a sequential
bandage machine

150
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,907
to have aeration holes
pierced in them.

151
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,109
these holes allow air
to circulate

152
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,780
and thus help promote healing.

153
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,249
these bandages are now ready.

154
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,452
sometimes
they print instructions

155
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,120
on bandage wrappers.

156
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,724
this paper-printing machine
is used with bandage machines.

157
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,994
two polymer plates receive ink
from a series of rollers

158
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,863
in order to reproduce
the desired design.

159
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,732
the bandages pass through
at high speed.

160
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,268
before being packaged,

161
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:08,338
the bandages are finally
sterilized 10,000 at a time.

162
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,874
bandages are automatically
counted here,

163
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:14,311
placed in a chute, and fall
into the packaging box.

164
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,688
the large role of e.t.s. fabric
seen at the beginning

165
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,891
will have allowed them to make
nearly 2 million bandages.

166
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,360
each year,
this facility produces

167
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,666
a staggering 4 billion bandages
in 65 different models.

168
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,910
narrator:
computer technology changes

169
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,714
quicker than just about
any other industry on earth,

170
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,183
so watch fast.

171
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,121
electronic circuits have shrunk
from miles of wiring

172
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,923
to the size of
a computer circuit board,

173
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,793
and they're still
getting smaller.

174
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,936
an electronic circuit board
is a computer component

175
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,273
that can produce spectacularly
realistic scenes.

176
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,276
animating this particular
three-dimensional graphic

177
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,145
took four months of work
by artists and programmers

178
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:27,351
with the aid of a g400
graphic processor by matrox.

179
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,486
a printed circuit board
can be compared

180
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,889
to a building composed
of fiberglass floors,

181
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,624
copper passageways,

182
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:38,027
and stairs that link the floors
between them.

183
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,698
cards are assembled
with two technologies --

184
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,033
surface wiring
and wiring through the card.

185
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:49,306
the components are placed into
the holes and soldered in place.

186
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,443
a stencil is used to apply
soldering paste onto the card.

187
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,246
this paste will solder
the surface components.

188
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,983
here they place the stencil
into the printing unit.

189
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:04,188
it is through these holes that
the soldering paste will run.

190
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,527
the machine spreads
the soldering paste,

191
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,398
which contains, among other
elements, a tin-lead alloy.

192
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,868
the printing blades
go into action.

193
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,870
they spread the soldering paste
onto the stencil.

194
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,473
this paste runs through
the stencil holes

195
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,210
and covers the metallic surfaces
of the printed circuit board,

196
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,180
which will establish
the electric current.

197
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:37,020
here's the difference
between an unprinted card

198
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,755
and another printed one --

199
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,226
the unprinted card's surface
is much more shiny.

200
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,966
now they're going to install
the surface-wiring elements.

201
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,503
they're automatically positioned
by this rapid-placement machine.

202
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:56,105
about 36,000 components
are installed per hour.

203
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,509
that's about 10 per second.

204
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,714
this incredibly
sophisticated machine

205
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,782
is equipped
with a viewing camera

206
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,785
which verifies the alignment
and dimensions of each part

207
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,320
before installation,

208
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:14,591
and it unerringly positions
the part at the exact spot.

209
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,197
another machine, slightly less
precise than the previous one,

210
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,401
installs parts where the space
between two placement points

211
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,070
is less than 2/100 of an inch.

212
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:31,041
it can install 8,000 parts
in 60 minutes.

213
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,617
the card continues on its way
toward the oven,

214
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,021
which accomplishes
an essential operation.

215
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,358
once the parts are secured,

216
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,761
the card goes into
a convection oven,

217
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,564
where the heat will solder
the parts to the card.

218
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,770
different circuit connectors
through the card

219
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,306
are inserted
into their respective holes.

220
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,243
this operation requires
great dexterity

221
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,313
and is entirely done by hand.

222
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,731
the metallic placement points
need to be soldered to the card.

223
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,669
the soldering of the circuit
components through the card

224
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,872
is done with a bath
of molten tin-lead alloy

225
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,643
at a temperature of 465 degrees.

226
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,017
now everything is installed.

227
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,086
they have to do
an initial electrical test.

228
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,690
the card is placed on a bed
of electrified pegs.

229
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,894
these pegs make contact with
the card's connecting points,

230
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,496
allowing them to check
for short circuits

231
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:04,434
or open circuits in the card.

232
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,770
and then a final test --

233
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,038
a computer-aided operating test

234
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,476
to see if the card
is functioning perfectly.

235
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:26,390
this company fabricates 200
different circuit board models

236
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,794
and produces about 4,000 cards
each week.

237
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,337
narrator:
the secrets behind

238
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,074
the world's finest spirits
and liquor

239
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,410
all boil down to one
simple recipe --

240
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:50,714
mix grain and water,
then ferment and distill.

241
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,349
add a few hundred years
of tradition,

242
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,153
and you begin to understand
why these bottles

243
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,588
are worth their weight in gold.

244
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,565
the principle of distillation
was known to ancient romans

245
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,299
who mastered the process.

246
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,102
however, we still don't know

247
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,570
the precise ingredients
they used.

248
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,039
in the middle ages,

249
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,909
stills produced the first
alcohols from wine.

250
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,246
the 7th century saw people
making ethyl alcohol,

251
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:27,117
and by the 15th century,
the process was further refined,

252
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,253
leading to the production
of today's brandy,

253
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,390
bourbon, cognac, and whiskey.

254
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:46,069
dried corn kernels are the main
grain used in making spirits.

255
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:50,273
every day, 7 truckloads
empty out 230 tons of it.

256
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,209
this corn will produce the basic
ingredient for spirits

257
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,013
such as whiskey, gin,
crème d'amande, and amaretto.

258
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,550
the kernels are stored
in these 80-foot-high silos,

259
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,686
which can hold up to 275 tons.

260
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,822
this is the distillery
control room.

261
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,625
they're going to make a recipe
that's 95% corn

262
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,228
and produces a neutral alcohol

263
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,632
to which they will add other
grains for color and flavor.

264
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,234
we see here the first step
on this screen --

265
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,437
the milling of the grain.

266
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,773
some 9 tons of corn flour
and 5,000 gallons of water

267
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,909
are introduced
into this autoclave

268
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,712
and cooked with live steam
for 90 minutes.

269
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,181
enzymes transform starch
into sugar.

270
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,718
then they add the yeast, which
converts sugar into alcohol.

271
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,587
fermentation lasts 60 hours
at 100 degrees.

272
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,324
the bubbling we see is created
by the action of the yeasts.

273
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,060
this cone removes
the carbon dioxide,

274
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,930
a natural by-product
of fermentation.

275
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:51,000
nearly 80 tons of carbon dioxide
are drawn off daily.

276
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,803
everything is monitored
by computer.

277
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:58,341
some 24 hours have now passed
since the start of fermentation.

278
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,278
when this stage has ended,

279
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,481
corn oil will come
to the surface

280
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,250
and is clearly visible
by its reddish color.

281
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,759
the fermented mash
has a 13% alcohol content.

282
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,828
they now move on to the next
step -- distillation,

283
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:23,566
which condenses the vapors
of the mix.

284
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,569
it's in this three-column
distillation system,

285
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,841
at a temperature of 185 degrees,
that the mash ferments

286
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:34,544
and is distilled by live steam
to separate the alcohol.

287
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:38,415
all the distillation columns
are continually monitored.

288
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,187
during distillation,

289
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,391
they dry the grains used in the
recipe in this rotating drum.

290
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,328
the resulting product
is called draff,

291
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,165
and it will be used
to make animal feed.

292
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,467
distillation is now ended.

293
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,602
to aromatize certain gins,

294
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:04,774
they add dried lemon skins,
some cinnamon, or coriander.

295
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:12,215
rum and whiskey will be aged
in these 350,000 oak barrels.

296
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,018
while aging,
these spirits will lose

297
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,821
about 3% of their
alcohol content annually

298
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,355
through evaporation.

299
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,259
also, the color
gradually darkens.

300
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,664
they're now ready to draw out
the liquid from the barrels

301
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,232
and put it into bottles.

302
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:33,970
but first they have to verify
the quality of the spirits.

303
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,973
they compare the standard
product with the new production.

304
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,709
this test is highly important

305
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:43,046
in order to assure the quality
of the final product.

306
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,587
bottling begins.

307
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,724
here, 140 750-milliliter bottles
of rum and spirts

308
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,594
are filled every minute.

309
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,529
clean bottles circulate
continually on the conveyor,

310
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,567
leading them
to the filling machine.

311
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,939
bottles are then filled
automatically by this machine.

312
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:14,177
it allows an exact quantity
to flow into each bottle.

00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:24,287
the next step, a capper
places caps on the bottles

314
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,556
and crimps them onto the necks.

315
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,825
then the sealed

316
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,761
head for
the packaging department.

00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:45,942
with 1.14 liters of
canadian whiskey every minute.
