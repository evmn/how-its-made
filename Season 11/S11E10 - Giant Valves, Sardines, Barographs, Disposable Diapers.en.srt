narrator: valves control the flow of liquids and gases 

2
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,454
through pipes and tubes.    

3
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,355
they're so much part of our lives,         

4
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,257
we hardly think twice about them.          

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,927
but a faulty valve in an airplane or chemical plant 

6
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,328
could be catastrophic.     

7
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,997
valves must be precision-made and trouble-free,       

8
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,067
whether it's small enough to fit inside the human body  

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,569
or as big as a car.      

10
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,009
many gate valves use handwheels
to control the flow.      

11
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,145
turning this wheel       

12
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,149
opens or closes a gate or wedge
inside the valve body.     

13
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,690
this giant 11-ton gate valve works the same way.      

14
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,559
it will receive an internal gate or wedge   

15
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,030
that starts and stops the flow of liquids or gases.      

16
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,498
first, an automated horizontal boring mill          

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,767
prepares the valve body for assembly          

18
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,769
and for a controlling mechanism.

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,306
it takes a controlling mechanism
or motor, not a handwheel,   

20
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:54,980
to open and close a wedge that weighs about 3,300 pounds.

21
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:59,585
an automated drill pilot drills
the flange of the valve body. 

22
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,787
this centers the holes used for the bolts       

23
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,455
that will connect the valve cover.        

24
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,860
a technician double-checks   

25
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,730
to make sure the holes are in the right place.    

26
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,400
then an automated spade drill starts penetrating the flange. 

27
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,804
coolant prevents the steel from heating up        

28
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,338
and removes steel chips    

29
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,041
from inside the perfectly centered holes. 

30
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,951
meanwhile, the wedge is ready. 

31
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,621
a propane torch preheats the wedge       

32
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,290
for the plasma-arc welding machine.        

33
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:42,293
this machine hard-faces the sealing surface of the wedge, 

34
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,930
a process that ensures minimal wear.   

35
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,301
hard-facing creates three rows of weld beads,   

36
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,737
which will be machined smooth. 

37
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,108
before installing the wedge,  

38
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,111
a technician inserts a seat ring
into the valve body.      

39
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,916
a seat ring helps ensure precision fit with the wedge. 

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,654
the ring fits into the grooved body cavity. 

41
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,691
then the technician sets another
seat ring into place.     

42
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,596
before the wedge goes in,   

43
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,598
a semiautomatic welding machine

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,466
welds the two seat rings into place           

45
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,770
using a rotating positioner.  

46
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,139
then a lapping machine inserted into the valve body  

47
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,409
polishes each seat ring to guarantee their finish   

48
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,711
is flat and smooth.      

49
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,952
next, a crane lowers the machined wedge   

50
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,354
into the body cavity.     

51
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,627
using a gauge, a technician verifies the gap.       

52
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,096
he repeatedly checks to see what adjustments    

53
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:55,100
the wedge may need to ensure a tight shutoff.   

54
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,306
another technician installs a sealer gasket    

55
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,276
to prepare the valve body for the cover or bonnet.    

56
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,581
now he begins final assembly. 

57
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,051
a fully adjusted wedge with the stem attached     

58
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,954
fits perfectly in between the two seat rings. 

59
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,859
this stem will connect to the controlling mechanism  

60
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,728
that opens and closes the valve.

61
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,999
a crane lowers the bonnet   

62
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,535
with attached yoke assembly onto the body.         

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,139
its studs fit exactly into the holes         

64
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,576
that were drilled into     
the valve's flange at the start.

65
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,885
a technician readies all the bolts for machine tightening. 

66
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,022
then he greases the top part of the stem.   

67
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,559
he lowers the controlling mechanism onto the stem,    

68
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,294
and he screws it into place  

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,564
until it's flush with the yoke,
the top part of the bonnet.  

70
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,636
a technician then bolts    

71
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,439
the controlling mechanism onto the yoke.         

72
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,109
finally, another technician spray-paints          

73
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,778
the fully assembled gate valve 

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,647
with a protective coat of corrosion-resistant paint.   

75
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,652
precision-made gate valves are expertly crafted.     

76
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,721
they come in all shapes and sizes           

77
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,922
and are equipped        

78
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,892
with controlling mechanisms or handwheels.         

79
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,597
from refineries and nuclear power plants    

80
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,400
to submarines and aircraft carriers,     

81
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,804
gate valves are helping our world run safely.     

82
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,485
narrator: the health benefits of eating fish         

83
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,619
are always under study.    

84
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,754
today, it's said that most fish,
like sardines,         

85
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,090
are a good source of vitamins, minerals,     

86
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,559
and omega-3 fatty acids.    

87
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,028
if you want to make healthy eating choices,        

88
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,496
you need to stay informed,   

89
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,499
so seeing how these little guys
end up on your kitchen table  

90
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,301
is a good way to start.    

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,709
sardines from the pacific   
coastal waters off of costa rica

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,180
are freshly packaged in a variety of tasty flavors. 

93
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,182
it starts when sardines    

94
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,519
are put into a vat of icy water
to keep them fresh.      

95
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,858
the temperature of the fish must be kept          

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,794
below 41 degrees fahrenheit to avoid spoiling.       

97
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,563
the fresh sardines then go through a machine   

98
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,167
that deposits the fish onto sorting lanes.      

99
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,340
each lane allows a certain sized fish  

100
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,610
to fall through the gap onto a chute below.      

101
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,817
sorted as small, medium, or large,       

102
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,987
the fish drop into the proper container.   

103
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,626
then workers load a specific size of sardine   

104
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,496
into a machine that removes the scales.    

105
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,098
removing the scales takes 3 to 11 minutes,     

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,634
depending on the size of the fish.          

107
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,038
once done, there is no mistaking a sardine     

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,973
with or without scales.    

109
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,312
workers then place descaled sardines onto trays  

110
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,714
that take them into a cutting machine.    

111
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,385
they arrange the sardines on the trays          

112
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,455
in such a way that blades inside the machine       

113
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,091
will cut off the heads and tails.           

114
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,663
a look inside the cutting machine      

115
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,132
shows how it removes the heads and tails       

116
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,801
and sends them on their separate ways.    

117
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,273
it also cuts open and cleans out
the bodies of the sardines   

118
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,876
and readies them for packaging.

119
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,481
the packing cans travel by conveyor to a work station, 

120
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,283
with their bottom side up and open.           

121
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,356
they fill the cans manually to decrease the possibility  

122
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:16,294
of introducing foreign matter into them.           

123
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,437
the worker draws on his experience    

124
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,705
to estimate the required weight,

125
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,710
then stuffs and trims the fish to fill the cans one by one.  

126
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,913
to be sure each can is exactly the right weight,  

127
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:38,016
he weighs and adjusts the amount in each tin.    

128
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,324
in only a matter of minutes, he completes a set of cans.   

129
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,799
then another worker turns the set over       

130
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,802
and sends the open-bottom cans into an oven          

131
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,640
that cooks the sardines at about
212 degrees fahrenheit.    

132
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,411
after cooking for about 25 minutes,     

133
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,414
a worker turns the set of cans over again           

134
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,751
and transfers them onto a conveyor system.    

135
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,153
all the cooked sardines    

136
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,155
gradually funnel into a single file,      

137
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,557
and depending on the product, 

138
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,693
a filling machine treats them to oil       

139
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,863
or a specific flavor of tomato sauce.        

140
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,235
the filling machine overfills the cans with sauce,      

141
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,304
but a flute hidden inside the machine       

142
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,943
removes just enough sauce to put the lids on properly.  

143
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,450
the machine pressure-seals the lids onto the cans     

144
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,322
so that when they exit the machine, they're airtight. 

145
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:54,259
the traveling cans then enter a machine that washes them   

146
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,330
in about 194-degree water and makes them spotless.    

147
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,402
pallets of cans then go into a chamber         

148
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,205
that sterilizes the product to keep it fresh.       

149
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,611
then the cans go into a labeling machine   

150
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,879
that applies a thin coating of glue            

151
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,749
and precut paper labels onto each one.         

152
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,087
the finished product comes out of the machine    

153
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,356
with an attractive full-color label,        

154
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,092
ready to ship to the customer. 

155
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,299
sardines come in a variety of flavors           

156
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,034
with easy-to-open packages   

157
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,803
that maintain the freshness of the fish.          

158
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,651
narrator: ancient civilizations
tried to forecast the weather 

159
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,986
by observing cloud patterns or even using astrology.    

160
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,321
today, we rely on instruments 

161
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,456
like the barometer or the barograph,        

162
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,592
which automatically records on paper            

163
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,794
the variations in atmospheric pressure.    

164
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,929
high pressure indicates good weather.    

165
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,265
low pressure means bad weather is likely.  

166
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,404
this barograph has three main parts --    

167
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,673
the recording arm,       

168
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,875
the cells that react to atmospheric pressure,    

169
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,343
and a rotating drum.      

170
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,012
to make the drum's lid,    

171
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,882
a die-press operator stamps out
a 3½-inch disk         

172
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,218
from a long strip of brass.  

173
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,620
he cleans off the grease from the die press       

174
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,091
and places the disk on another press to form an edge.     

175
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,430
to make the drum,       

176
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:42,000
he cuts a 4-inch-long cylinder from a brass tube.       

177
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:48,639
next, he places the drum on an arm that rotates at high speed.

178
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:53,044
he etches fine lines      
into the brass using steel wool.

179
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,251
thanks to a handy rotating device,    

180
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,788
all the drums get an even coating of protective lacquer 

181
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,557
so the brass doesn't corrode. 

182
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,262
the barograph's mechanism rests on a solid brass plate  

183
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:15,399
that's 8½ inches long by 5 inches wide.       

184
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,002
a worker greases each one   

185
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,138
and then places them on a press

186
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,108
that punches out the holes for the fastening screws.    

187
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,879
next, he places the plate in a metal holder       

188
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,481
and buffs it with a rotating polishing brush.        

189
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,883
he applies wax to the brush  

190
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,520
to help achieve a perfect mirror finish.    

191
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,563
now workers use a fine grade of sandpaper          

192
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,098
to polish the solid brass arms 

193
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,167
that will hold the working parts
in place.           

194
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,239
then they line them up on a board           

195
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,041
and buff them with a polishing brush.    

196
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,711
how do they get those parts so shiny?           

197
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:03,515
by washing off any machine grease before polishing them. 

198
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,852
putting the barograph together is precision work.       

199
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,988
laid out before the assembler 

200
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,790
are all the working parts she will need.         

201
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,260
she begins with an arm, inserts a brass screw,     

202
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,732
then sets in a second arm and attaches them to the baseplate.

203
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,606
these hollow metal cells are the key to the mechanism. 

204
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,209
air pressure makes them expand and contract.      

205
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,478
the barograph records this movement         

206
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,080
to measure high and low pressure systems. 

207
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,554
the cell stack is put in place on the baseplate.       

208
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,491
then they add the lever system 

209
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,759
that connects the recording arm
to the paper.         

210
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,363
this lever system connects to the arm,      

211
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,566
raising and lowering it so the felt pen at the tip   

212
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,967
can record changing air-pressure levels      

213
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,970
on the drum's rotating chart. 

214
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:05,410
the assembler inserts tiny pins
to hold it together.      

215
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,852
inside the drum's base is a battery-driven quartz clock, 

216
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,655
which maintains a steady rate of rotation.   

217
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,661
now she wraps the chart around the drum        

218
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,064
and attaches a brass clip to hold it in place.      

219
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,535
the drum rotates once over a seven-day period,    

220
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,806
so slowly that the movement is invisible to the naked eye. 

221
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,208
there's a gear system inside the drum,        

222
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,810
which rotates it once it's set on the axle.   

223
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,212
a brass screw holds it in place.

224
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,551
now the worker puts the mechanism on a mahogany base. 

225
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,619
she screws it into place,   

226
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,756
then covers it with a glass and mahogany housing.     

227
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,491
brass hinges and a closing mechanism    

228
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,396
hold the housing firmly in place
and provides easy access.   

229
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,903
a quality controller places the barograph      

230
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,839
into a pressure-sealed chamber to check its accuracy.     

231
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,308
he compares the barograph's recordings   

232
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,043
to gauges outside the chamber 

233
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,312
that measure the changes in air pressure        

234
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,382
that he applies inside the chamber.      

235
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,851
this weekly chart shows hour-by-hour recordings 

236
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,855
of air-pressure variations measured in hectopascals,    

237
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,525
a unit of atmospheric pressure.

238
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,861
barographs are available in a variety of designs,    

239
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,298
from modern to traditional brass
and mahogany models      

240
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,834
that any sailor would be proud to own.     

241
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,880
narrator: parenthood has many joys,   

242
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,949
but a dirty diaper isn't one of them.       

243
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,285
and that's why we have disposable diapers.      

244
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,155
they were first introduced in the 1940s for travel use.  

245
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,559
it took several years for the idea to catch on.   

246
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,229
but when it did, diaper duty was never the same.

247
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,903
many would say disposable diapers       

248
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,171
represent a change for the better,        

249
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,175
helping parents make the best of a messy business.      

250
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,979
they start with superabsorbent polymer particles,       

251
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,583
which drop into a forming chamber.    

252
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:29,320
pulp unwinds into the same chamber.     

253
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,925
a spray of water helps suppress
any static electricity     

254
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:37,394
that could interfere with processing.        

255
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,131
inside, the pulp mixes with the polymer particles.  

256
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,201
the result is this fluffy absorbent material       

257
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,336
that will be the diaper core. 

258
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,741
this rotating drum has a vacuum          

259
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,410
that shapes the fluffy material
into padding.         

260
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,678
another vacuum drum      

261
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,281
then merges the padding to a moving web of fabric.   

262
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,290
guides fold the fabric around the padding,      

263
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,026
and a hot adhesive seals it.  

264
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,965
at this debulking station, rollers compress the padding, 

265
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,434
making the diaper core slim enough          

266
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,570
to comfortably fit a baby.   

267
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,512
a cylindrical cutter slices the diaper core to size.

268
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,850
at another station,      

269
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,319
plastic film winds around guides

270
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,122
and merges with another stream of fabric.           

271
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,458
machinery glues the layers together   

272
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,793
to form the diaper's back side.

273
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,396
next, equipment pulls elastic bands         

274
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,266
into other layers of fabric to make leg cuffs       

275
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,536
and outer gathers on the top portion of the diaper.     

276
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,872
the elastic will ensure the diaper fits snuggly,    

277
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,274
preventing leaks.       

278
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,677
each diaper will be equipped with a set of these front tabs 

279
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,846
punched out by this rotating die.     

280
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,822
this cylinder applies stretch side panels      

281
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,624
to the top part of the diaper, 

282
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,227
which has the leg cuffs and gathers.          

283
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,231
the absorbent core now meets up

284
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,033
with the back side of the diaper.         

285
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,902
and then the other layers come together and adhere.   

286
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,112
a computerized system monitors the assembly.     

287
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,516
incredibly, it takes less than a quarter of a second   

288
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,785
for all the layers of the disposable diaper    

289
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,253
to be assembled.        

290
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,661
the diapers now travel past guides     

291
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,231
that fold down the tabs and side panels.        

292
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,105
the diapers are then cut into individual units.     

293
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,978
again, belted rollers compress the completed diapers.     

294
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,217
paddles then fold them in half.

295
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:22,293
conveyor belts relay the folded
diapers to a carousel.     

296
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:25,763
finger paddles separate them  

297
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,833
and position them for packaging.

298
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,500
sensors count the diapers   

299
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,170
as they move toward compression arms        

300
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,773
that squeeze the required number together. 

301
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:40,444
a pusher swoops in       
to slide the diapers into a bag.

302
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:44,148
vacuum arms open the bags right on cue.  

303
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:51,088
hot bars seal the package full of diapers.        

304
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,392
it then moves down the line  

305
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,795
to be packed into boxes for shipping.         

306
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,268
each disposable diaper has a phenomenal capacity   

307
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,670
to absorb liquid,       

308
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,873
and the key is those polymer particles.  

309
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,142
they act as tiny gel sponges, 

310
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:15,346
expanding to hold many times their weight in fluid.     

311
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,682
cut open a wet diaper, and you'll discover the liquid 

312
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,319
has turned the solid particles into gel.           

313
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,291
the proof is in the weighing. 

314
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,559
for example,          

315
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,762
this dry diaper comes in at about an ounce and a half. 

316
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:36,566
when wet, it weighs over 18 ounces.   

317
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,869
and that's the bottom line.
