00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,491
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,327
handcuffs...          

3
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,099
...caulking and joint compound...     

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,571
...propane tanks...      

5
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,179
...and forensic facial reconstruction.     

6
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,252
when a crime is committed,   

7
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,922
a slap on the wrist usually isn't enough.     

8
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,990
it's time to handcuff them.  

9
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:02,127
the need for some restraint goes back centuries,      

10
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,464
but the handcuff's design was really improved in 1862  

11
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,866
when adjustable ratchets were added.          

12
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,703
they allow the cuffs to snugly grip the suspect's wrist.   

13
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,277
when they put the handcuffs on you,            

14
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,947
you know you may be in trouble.

15
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,283
handcuffs start with a roll of steel.     

16
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,156
a machine pulls it through a straightener     

17
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,490
and then through a die     

18
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,860
that punches out a handcuff frame part.     

19
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,900
a revolving barrel cage sifts out the waste      

20
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,269
and kicks the frames into a bin.

21
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,908
here, a worker stacks "u"-shaped
steel parts on a fixture,   

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,945
which he then clamps onto a machine.        

23
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,850
a cutter makes ratchet teeth in the parts.         

24
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,450
coolant keeps the tool     

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,655
from heating up and getting too soft to do the job.    

26
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,493
each set of handcuffs     
will have two of these ratchets.

27
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:14,065
next, they load steel rods into a slowly revolving device.

28
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,069
it moves the rods through a series of cutters.  

29
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,805
this is how they make swivels for the handcuffs.       

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,909
they round the tips of the rods
and then carve necks below.  

31
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:33,785
this tool slices the swivel to the proper length.     

32
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,993
and then the partially finished
swivel falls into a basket.  

33
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,697
next, a drill works on the rounded tip,   

34
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,833
scooping out the center.    

35
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,570
and now you have a finished swivel.       

36
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:56,108
they take two chain links and two swivels.        

37
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,777
they make a small chain --   

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,381
two links with swivels on the ends.          

39
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,719
they lock the links and the swivels together.   

40
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,796
and now the swivel-link assembly
is complete.          

41
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,799
the swivels will provide some rotational freedom     

42
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,933
between the cuffs.       

43
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,269
but if they don't weld the links together,      

44
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,239
the prisoner could have total freedom.   

45
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,618
it's time to assemble the handcuffs.         

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,155
they install studs in the outer framework     

47
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,123
and attach the ratchets to them.

48
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:54,032
the swivel link fits into the 
little grooves in the framework.

49
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,170
they hammer the inner frame on 

50
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,975
and then lift the top and bottom
assemblies together.      

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,584
a tap with a hammer holds them loosely together.  

52
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:18,256
then a press bears down to make a tight seal.     

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,992
these cuffs look complete,   

54
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,393
but they aren't quite ready for a life of crime.      

55
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,262
they need to be toughened up. 

56
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,265
so they spend 25 minutes in a furnace,         

57
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,336
and the searing heat hardens the seal.       

58
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,004
this is the pawl,       

59
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:37,475
a spring-loaded bar that will 
engage the teeth of the ratchet.

60
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,946
they lock the pawl and spring in place.           

61
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,616
a press pushes pins into the assembly       

62
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,153
to hold everything in position.

63
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,489
then they stamp serial numbers onto each set of handcuffs   

64
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,560
so that the police can keep track of them.    

65
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,498
now the handcuffs shake in a vibrating bin full of stones.

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,368
this polishes the rough edges. 

67
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,637
it's time for the ultimate test.

68
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,542
they activate a 500-pound pull, 
and the handcuffs remain strong.

69
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,384
they also tap each set to make sure the ratchets drop freely. 

70
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,058
handcuffs are temporary restraints,     

71
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,394
and most can be opened with the universal key.    

72
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,996
they pack two with each set,  

73
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,733
along with the instructions.  

74
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,136
there's no doubt they'll have a captive market 

75
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,273
because there's always someone who needs to be locked up.   

76
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:45,377
but then again, there are also 
those who deserve their freedom.

77
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,758
narrator: the need to seal windows and cracks       

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,762
in walls and floors has been around since antiquity.    

79
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,498
lucky for us, we no longer have to stuff rags       

80
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,034
or smelly fish glue into these crevices.      

81
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,503
today's caulking and drywall compounds     

82
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:15,607
form durable synthetic seals that also blend into the decor.

83
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:24,516
this company's caulking comes 
in two types, latex and acrylic,

84
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,652
both good for indoor and outdoor use.  

85
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,989
to make acrylic caulking, they blend water with chemicals

86
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,693
that prevent mold and help the 
caulking withstand cold weather.

87
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:40,599
everything blends for about one minute.     

88
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,206
the batch then goes into another mixer       

89
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:52,210
containing 1,500 pounds of synthetic resin.      

90
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,612
they add a plasticizer     

91
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,414
that keeps the caulking flexible
over time.           

92
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,950
a combination of colorants tints the caulking --     

93
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,187
in this case, a shade of brown called sandalwood.       

94
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,563
after 15 minutes of blending, the caulking is ready.     

95
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,897
to test the batch,       

96
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,434
they cure a sample at 77 degrees
fahrenheit for one week...   

97
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,070
then check its flexibility.  

98
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,306
if the batch gets the okay, it goes into this machine,   

99
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,143
which lines up plastic caulking tubes.    

100
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,920
piston pumps lift four tubes at a time,   

101
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,789
and the nozzles fill each tube with 10 ounces of caulking.  

102
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,594
the machine can fill up to 1,000 tubes per hour.    

103
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,940
the machine then seals the bottom end of the tubes  

104
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,341
with plastic covers.      

105
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,778
the top ends have closed nozzles
with replaceable caps.     

106
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,683
thanks to the resins and plasticizers,       

107
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,553
this company's products last up to 30 years.      

108
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,390
that's the tough side of caulking,          

109
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,294
but there's also a gentler, craftier side.   

110
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,297
start by drawing a pattern on a piece of paper.      

111
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,801
then lay glass on top and run caulking along the pattern.

112
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,440
after 48 hours,        

113
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,109
the caulking hardens into a delicate lattice.    

114
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,980
then fill in the spaces with clear silicone      

115
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,581
for a frosted look.      

116
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,917
use a small steel brush and rubber gloves       

117
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,053
to spread it and create texture.

118
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,923
perfect for a door or a bathroom window.     

119
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,264
this factory also makes joint compound.   

120
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,067
use this product to cover cracks, holes, and seams    

121
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,268
in drywall.          

122
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,871
to make it, they mix 185 gallons of water      

123
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,873
with chemicals that prevent mold

124
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,644
and a type of clay that makes the compound more spreadable. 

125
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:13,018
now for the main ingredient -- 440 pounds of chalk.      

126
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,555
it's what remains on the wall when the compound dries.    

127
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,224
next, they add mica,      

128
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,226
a mineral whose tiny plates slide over each other     

129
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,564
to make the compound flexible and help prevent cracking.   

130
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,134
they test the thickness with a device         

131
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,405
that gauges how much pressure it takes to stir the compound. 

132
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,846
next, they take a sample from every batch        

133
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,982
and measure the ph level.   

134
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,786
it should have a reading of 8.8,
quite high because of the chalk.

135
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,458
this is what's called a sandability test.      

136
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,460
technicians first let a precise
amount of compound harden   

137
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,396
on a piece of drywall.     

138
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,131
this machine then sands it down,

139
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,001
applying 100 strokes in 2 minutes.         

140
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,942
technicians then remeasure the combined weight      

141
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,410
of the compound and drywall,  

142
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,746
registering how much has been lost.         

143
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,149
maximum weight loss should be 4%.         

144
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,886
if the batch passes the test, they feed it into this machine.

145
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,556
it pumps compound into either small-size, 6.6-pound     

146
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:30,227
or large-size, 15.5-pound plastic buckets.        

147
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,231
then using a hydraulic press, 

148
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,101
a worker seals the containers with plastic covers.      

149
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,837
to open the bucket, you break a small plastic tab 

150
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,505
and lift off the cover.    

151
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,843
joint compound also has its crafty uses.   

152
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,111
with a stencil,        

153
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,647
you can apply small amounts in intricate patterns     

154
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,449
to decorate a picture frame or a mirror.          

155
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,285
now, that is some fancy filler.

156
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,663
narrator: compressing propane 

157
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,398
allows you to sell it by the bottle.         

158
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,735
when you compress it,     
propane gas turns into a liquid,

159
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,004
and as a liquid, it's much more compact,    

160
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,273
which means you can pack a lot of energy        

161
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,741
into a small container.    

162
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,610
opening the valve converts it back to gas,    

163
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,681
giving you energy that you can put to good use. 

164
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,756
bottling energy means you can always have fuel on hand.   

165
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:36,361
to make these tanks, they start
with this big coil of steel.  

166
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:41,299
a press punches out 3 disks 19 inches in diameter     

167
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,034
with each swoop.        

168
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,112
a second press clamps the disk 

169
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,314
as a cylinder-shaped die thrusts upward,        

170
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,583
transforming it into a shell. 

171
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,701
each shell is 1/2 of a barbecue tank.      

172
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,875
next, suctioning devices    

173
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,212
carry the tank shells over to a trimmer,       

174
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,214
where a blade gives it a neat edge.          

175
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,018
workers then insert flanges  

176
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,889
into prepunched holes in the top shells.       

177
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,562
the top and bottom halves of the barbecue tanks     

178
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,965
now move in separate directions.

179
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,502
the tops head into an automated welding station  

180
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,139
where the flanges are fused to them.       

181
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,909
the weld has to be perfect   

182
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,246
so it can take the pressure of compressed fuel       

183
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,348
without exploding.       

184
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:12,056
this die simultaneously bends steel strips into rings    

185
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,359
and punches holes in them.   

186
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,130
these rings will be used as pedestals,   

187
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,267
and the holes can be used to mount the tank to a barbecue. 

188
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,276
next, a machine welds the rings

189
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,846
to the bottoms of the tank shells.      

190
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,660
the top and bottom tank shells converge.           

191
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,966
and a pusher device nudges the tops onto the bottoms.   

192
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,178
they load each freshly assembled
tank onto a welding lathe.   

193
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,781
the lathe turns as an automated welding gun  

194
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,515
follows the seam precisely,  

195
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,985
melting and bonding the two pieces together.    

196
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,455
but this processing has hardened the steel...   

197
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,790
not a good thing        

198
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,459
because these tanks will need to expand and contract     

199
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,728
to accommodate pressurized fuel.

200
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,566
so they temper the tanks in a furnace.         

201
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,473
they do random tests of the welded seam.       

202
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:39,076
they cut out a piece of the tank
and grind it on both sides   

203
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,214
to expose the weld.      

204
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,682
then they use a jack      

205
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,820
to bend the sample right at the seam.       

206
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,656
it doesn't split and passes the test.      

207
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,430
in another test, they lower  
a tank into a water-filled drum.

208
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,232
they pump water into the tank, 

209
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,834
causing pressure inside the drum
to rise,            

210
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:08,506
proving the tank will indeed expand with pressure changes. 

211
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,509
the tanks then travel down a row
of paint guns,         

212
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,710
which spray them        

213
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,446
with electrostatically charged powder paint.         

214
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,185
the tanks journey about a half mile to an inspection station. 

215
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,624
here, workers check for contaminants.    

216
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,263
then they drop valves into the flanged openings   

217
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,333
and place the barbecue cylinder
in a special machine      

218
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,769
that screws the valve on very tightly.         

219
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,880
in one final test, they submerge
air-filled tanks in water.   

220
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,482
if the water doesn't bubble up,

221
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,485
it means the valve isn't leaking.         

222
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,020
and after all that,      

223
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,624
these barbecue tanks should be 
able to take plenty of grilling.

224
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,171
narrator: when the usual ways of
identifying human remains fail 

225
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,906
and the investigation stalls, 

226
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,308
police sometimes need a little image building,    

227
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,377
as in facial reconstruction.  

228
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,181
using the skull, they re-create
the face of the deceased    

229
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,716
in hopes that it will jog someone's memory.       

230
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,619
it's a high-tech way to solve a mystery.       

231
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,194
to reconstruct a face,     

232
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,263
the specialist uses resin to make an exact replica    

233
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,766
of the unidentified man's cranium.            

234
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,407
he attaches it to the rest of the skull cast.       

235
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,179
and now he has an exact copy of the man's skull.      

236
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,685
next he measures rubber pegs to different lengths      

237
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,153
that are equivalent to the various thicknesses   

238
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,089
of facial skin.        

239
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,826
the short one is placed on the 
forehead where the skin is thin.

240
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:21,772
then he installs actual    
prosthetic eyes made of plastic.

241
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,243
those are suction cups protruding from them now.   

242
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,711
they help him to align the eyes.

243
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,246
he shines a light into them  

244
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:33,384
to confirm that they're looking
straight ahead.        

245
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,454
next he cuts out muscle shapes from rolled clay.       

246
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,192
this piece simulates the area around the mouth.       

247
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,398
the man's muscles have left tension marks on his skull.  

248
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,668
those marks combined with the knowledge of facial anatomy

249
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,138
help him decide where to build up muscle.   

250
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,740
he makes the face expressionless

251
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,542
because expressions are unique 

252
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,913
and impossible to extrapolate from a skull.         

253
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,718
next he sculpts muscle around the prosthetic eyes.  

254
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,624
there are no clues about the  
actual shape of this man's eyes,

255
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,860
so he gives them a generic look.

256
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,503
the skull does divulge     
the length and width of the nose

257
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:29,440
as well as the location of the nostrils.        

258
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,643
now he builds up smiling muscles

259
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,113
followed by fat and a salivary gland.     

260
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,451
he uses different-colored clay 
so he can see them more clearly.

261
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,587
he maps out a location for the ears          

262
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,191
but doesn't yet attach them.  

263
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,326
he shapes muscles in the neck, 

264
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,065
working from measurements   
and photos from the crime scene.

265
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,434
next he gives the model skin. 

266
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,379
as he applies this layer of clay,      

267
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,983
he uses the protruding pegs as thickness guides.      

268
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,126
and after much sculpting, the model has come to life.  

269
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,964
but he needs one more clay ear.

270
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,034
the skull offers some hints about the ears' size      

271
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,970
but not their shape, so he keeps that generic.   

272
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,781
now he sponges the clay to give it some texture    

273
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,550
so it looks more like real skin.

274
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,724
the artist snaps his picture with a digital camera     

275
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,594
and then downloads the image onto a computer.        

276
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,930
using photo-editing software, 

277
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,999
he transfers some hair to the shot of the clay model. 

278
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,268
he knows from evidence on the scene          

279
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,604
that the man's hair was styled in dreadlocks    

280
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,639
and that he had a beard.    

281
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,815
he borrows brows from another photo.      

282
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,094
he paints in the brows with a stylus,         

283
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,297
which is a kind of computer mouse.       

284
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,367
using the same technique,   

285
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,502
he gives the image facial hair.

286
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,779
this digital artistry takes a couple of days,    

287
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,648
and the skull mold and clay model         

288
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,317
take 12 days to complete...  

289
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,253
time well spent        

290
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,387
because once the pictures and information        

291
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,390
are posted on police sites like this one,         

292
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,460
it may finally help them put a name to this face.
