gait and lead to injuries. it's why custom-made running

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,936
tailored for one specific pair of feet, they give the runner the necessary support to go

the concept one step further.

00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:44,036
they start by taking a precise 3-d laser scan of each foot.  

10
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:50,676
device called a pressure plate. rubber tipped pins sprout up  

11
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:58,383
this technique creates an exact outline of the sole, including 

12
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:03,189
next, a high-pressure water jet cuts through synthetic fabric  

13
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,994
a computer guides the cuts, following the measurements from   the scans. 

14
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:13,465
the cutouts will be used to make the upper -- that's the part of the shoe that

top of the foot. a seamstress sews together the

plastic replica of the athlete's foot, called a last, into the

she glues fabric to the heel of each shoe, and then pounds and presses it to ensure the fa

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,937
adheres.

left to sit for five hours, the shoes conform to the shape of

but if the measurements are even slightly off, they'll scrap the  shoe and st 

29
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:50,762
it's time for the foam midsoles. the workers cut the foam with  

30
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:57,969
feet. the foam is dual density for

landing when the foot hits the ground. the outsole 

33

the worker sculpts these treaded rubber soles along the same   

34
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:29,868
they'll fit together perfectly. he glues the mid and outer soles    together 

35
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,740
to make sure this job really sticks, they squeeze the two soles together using a   h 

36
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:43,481
press. in a custom shoe, the athlete  

37
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:48,354
a deeper tread is more appropriate for trail running, 

38

pavement better.         

39
00:04:50,491 --> 00:05:03,569
the worker now glues the bottom of the shoe to the top. the sole is made a little l 

40
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:08,707
than the fabric upper, which allows her to fold it around the    upper for

a machine they call the claw applies pressure to enhance the bonding of the sole to the s

00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:28,059
then they insert a memory foam insole which melds to the shape  of the foo

this insole is also breathable and has been treated with an

>> narrator: ever since primitive times, humans have  

47
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:12,637
the first axes were simple, sharpened stones, but when a  

48
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,176
years ago, it increased the force that could be applied with each strike, 

49
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:26,918
ax much greater impact. today, the ax hasn't lost its

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,591
despite the proliferation of mechanized tools, it offers a  

51
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:40,532
the job done. a modern ax starts as a cylinder of high-qu 

52
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:46,739
a ram nudges it into an induction furnace. the intense heat makes the s 

53
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:56,015
white hot and pliable, allowing it to be stretched and shaped. a powerful press then pounds  

54
00:06:56,017 --> 00:07:06,691
steel into a series of dies to further define the ax profile. 

55
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:12,030
operators now transfer the ax to another ram, which presses it  

56
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:18,169
level it. then it's on to a revolving rack for a half-hour to cool down  

57
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:26,245
harden, just enough so they can be handled.  a worker 

58
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:33,252
axes into a tumbler. they are tossed about with tiny steel pellets, and the   r 

59
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:38,390
friction rubs scale from the surface of the steel and also  

60
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:50,602
then this worker presses the back of the ax head against a sanding belt to bevel the e 

61
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:57,342
he sands the sides of the ax head for a smooth finish.  i 

62
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:05,283
both sides of the cutting edge. it takes well-honed skill to do this with such quick      

63
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:12,357
he then polishes the neck of the ax against a narrower,     

64
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:19,498
and it's time for a dip in a special solution, heated to   

65
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,502
they then quench the red-hot steel in warm oil.  the  

66
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:30,308
hardens the metal so it's tough enough for any wood-chopping  

67
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,581
at the next station, a worker assembles prepunched leather and  plastic rin 

68
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,120
grip. she places the black-and-white plastic rings at each end of  

69
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:48,193
leather pad, to give the grip a customized look.   the  

70
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:55,867
smaller as she tapers the grip to fit the throat ax handle. it takes about 36 of the    

71
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:05,144
rings and 6 plastic ones to make one grip. she transf 

72
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:11,483
an assembly press...and inserts the lower part of the ax, which  has been l

through. the lubrication ensures this job doesn't hit  

75
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:33,972
she now flattens metal prongs at the base of the handle to secure    the grip 

76
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:39,978
the axes rotate as a long, abrasive belt rocks against the    leather.  

77
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,982
it sands the grip to make the layers flush.

00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:56,061
a worker finishes off the job with a particularly aggressive

his handiwork makes this grip look really smooth.  a di

00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:32,096
once the lacquer dries, another worker polishes the exposed steel against a belt with a  

82
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:38,903
fine grit. the result is a glossy sheen

it takes about two days to make one of these axes, but they're

86
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,546
in europe. the karts look a bit like mi

this italian-made racing kart -- with its one-cylinder, 125cc engine -- reaches speeds of

miles per hour. an aluminum case houses all the   engine com

93
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:08,327
of several gears. they thread them onto a shaft.

behind the gears goes the gear shifter, which the driver op

next comes the drive shaft. it turns a chain that rotates

rear wheels are mounted. on the other side of the engine case, they

00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:08,447
technicians use special instruments to monitor and   

110
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:14,052
the racing kart's chassis is made of steel tubing. at the back, they mount    

111
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:24,129
to hold the rear axle. then they mount the axle itself    and on i

00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:29,200
they attach brake calipers to the chassis. under breaking, they squeeze  

113
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:34,806
disks to stop the wheels from turning. after measuring again, to e

00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:40,077
the rear axle is perfectly centered, they lock it into p

technicians mount a spindle on each side.  the spin

once technicians fasten the steering column up top, they

tie rods transmit the rotation of the steering column, via the spindles, to 

121
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:29,928
next, technicians mount two spring-loaded pedals in front of  the chassis.

the brake system is hydraulic, meaning that pressurized fluid

switches to finer tools to craft her gory features.

00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:27,245
he uses water and a sponge to give her skin realistic texture. once the clay is hardened,

lay crazy kristen on her back and drown here in gypsum    

138
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:41,059
in an hour or so, the plaster sets, and they remove the sculpture, creating a mold   

139
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:48,600
which they'll produce multiple crazy kristens. the mold is quite heavy, so

easier handling, they sever the body in two.   then t

chains for her arm bones, ball bearings for her joints, and steel reinforced rubber for

00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:29,093
half-and-half mixture of house paint and liquid latex rubber. 

163

off-white opaque ink.      

164
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:38,503
then they airbrush the iris...

and paint in the pupil with the

airbrushed ink on her

they top her off with a wig,   

173
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,065
mount her lower body to the   

174
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,933
base, then complete her look

the show, or if you'd like to
