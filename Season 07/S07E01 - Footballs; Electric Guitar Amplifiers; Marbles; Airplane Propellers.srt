00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,291
            narrator:           
  today, on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,360
          footballs...          

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,901
...electric-guitar amplifiers...

4
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,972
          ...marbles...         

5
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,644
   ...and airplane propellers.  

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,422
  in 1869, players in the first 
football game used a round ball,

7
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,790
         like in soccer.        

8
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,460
      it was tough to carry     
      and awkward to throw,     

9
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,396
       so they changed it       
 to look more like a watermelon.

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,464
        the current shape       
      enables a better grip     

11
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,802
      and passing on an arc     
   that's unique to football.   

12
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,746
         a lot of people        
        handle a football       

13
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,881
       before it ever gets      
          to the field.         

14
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,216
    they start with cowhide.    

15
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,285
   footballs are traditionally  
      made of this leather      

16
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,221
because it wears well over time.

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,223
  with a die, a worker cuts out 
        the four sections       

18
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,059
  that make up the ball's skin. 

19
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,301
 a stamping machine then brands 
 the skin with the company logo.

20
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,703
   they may put other markings  
     elsewhere on the ball,     

21
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,239
     depending on the design    
  of the model they're making.  

22
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,581
      each of the sections      
       goes into a machine      

23
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,517
     that trims the pieces'     
  combined weight down to spec. 

24
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,091
     to strengthen the skin,    

25
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,594
          a seamstress          
  sews cotton and vinyl linings 

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,996
     onto all four sections.    

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,203
  then she places them in a die 

28
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:22,474
       that positions them      
  for another set of markings.  

29
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,544
     these four white lines     
      will form two stripes     

30
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,546
when the sections come together.

31
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,281
    this is purely aesthetic    

32
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,884
      and varies according      
     to the football model.     

33
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,753
      now it's time to sew      
    the top sections together   

34
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,222
    and then the bottom ones    
         to each other.         

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,624
    exactly how many stitches   
           this takes           

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,295
        is this company's       
     closely guarded secret.    

37
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:46,164
     this press makes a hole    
   in one of the top sections   

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,833
       for the air valve.       

39
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,904
      they make eight holes     
       in the top sections      

40
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,173
    for laces that will hold    
        the skin tightly        

41
00:02:55,176 --> 00:03:00,111
     around an inflated bag     
        called a bladder.       

42
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,914
       to join the ball's       
    top and bottom sections,    

43
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,716
 the seamstress first cups them 

44
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,985
         and then joins         
       the edges together.      

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,920
 she sews the leather inside out

46
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,189
      to make the stitches      
          less visible.         

47
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,791
    later, workers will turn    
     the skin right-side out    

48
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,595
 by reaching through the opening
     between the lace holes.    

49
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,164
       this is also where       
   they'll insert the bladder.  

50
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,936
         it's important         
   to flatten the four seams.   

51
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,939
   to do this, a worker places  
      each one on a wheel,      

52
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,142
           as a roller          
      passes over the top.      

53
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,143
       this keeps the ball      
        from being bumpy        

54
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,680
   when they stretch the skin   
        over the bladder.       

55
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,620
        a 15-second steam       
       softens the leather      

56
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,289
       and makes it easier      
         to manipulate.         

57
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,094
         a concave press        
 flattens the seams at the tips.

58
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,697
  this will also keep the ball  
  smooth when they inflate it.  

59
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,100
      time to turn the skin     
         right-side out.        

60
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,237
      the worker places it      
         on a metal bar,        

61
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,306
   then, reaching through the   
 opening between the lace holes,

62
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:04,643
   he grabs the other side of   
 the skin and pulls it through. 

63
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,112
      then he runs the bar      
        along the inside        

64
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,680
      to reshape the skin.      

65
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:16,054
     the bladder is made of     
polyurethane, a type of plastic,

66
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:19,857
       with a vinyl patch       
  reinforcing the lacing area.  

67
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,594
   after squeezing the bladder  
        inside the skin,        

68
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,263
       a worker snips off       
    the end of the air valve    

69
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,066
   to keep it out of the way.   

70
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,602
        then she inflates       
        the bladder a bit       

71
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,272
     to make it rigid enough    
           for lacing.          

72
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,275
    after steadying the ball    
          with clamps,          

73
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,412
    she uses an awl to thread   
  the lace through the holes -- 

74
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,949
      just one vinyl lace,      
      measuring four feet.      

75
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,885
   it worms through both sides  
    and then down the center    

76
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,155
    and through all the holes   
           once again.          

77
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,427
      the lacing is spaced      
   about a half inch apart --   

78
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,096
 wide enough to comfortably grip

79
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,432
       for that magic pass      
       you've got in mind.      

80
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,373
    next, workers temporarily   
     overinflate the balls.     

81
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,375
    steel molds surround them   

82
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,644
    to ensure they'll assume    
       the correct shape.       

83
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,781
        after 90 seconds,       
    the extra air seeps out.    

84
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,850
            finally,            
 the factory inspects the balls 

85
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,386
            to ensure           
     they're up to standard.    

86
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,058
   fully inflated, a ball must  
  weigh no more than 15 ounces. 

87
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,996
 it should measure 21 1/2 inches
       through the middle       

88
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,966
 and 28 inches around both ends.

89
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,274
        after a five-day        
     manufacturing process,     

90
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,843
      these balls are ready     
         for the field.         

91
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,827
            narrator:           
 you have to plug an electrical 
    guitar into an amplifier    

92
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,362
    if you want it to be more   
      than barely audible.      

93
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,765
       a guitar amplifier       
   is typically a boxed unit,   

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,434
        containing an amp       
 to boost the electronic signal 

95
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,768
       and a loudspeaker.       

96
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,103
         some amplifiers        

97
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,840
      use state-of-the-art      
     silicon-chip circuitry,    

98
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,110
          while others          
  use traditional vacuum tubes. 

99
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,046
    [ mid-tempo music plays ]   

100
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,987
the amp's electronics are housed
     inside a metal chassis.    

101
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,590
  this model's chassis is made  
      from a sheet of metal     

102
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,858
        that's less than        
        .04 inches thick.       

103
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,728
    a computer-guided machine   
      called a turret punch     

104
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,730
        cuts the contour        

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
      and pierces a series      
       of holes and slots       

106
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,000
        for the controls.       

107
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,874
       a worker then uses       
    a computer-guided bender    

108
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,042
  to shape the chassis cutout.  

109
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,550
    elsewhere in the factory,   

110
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,885
     the amp's circuit board    
          takes shape.          

111
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,887
  it'll go inside the chassis.  

112
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,290
     a computer-guided drill    
        makes tiny holes        

113
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,426
       in a laminate board      
   that's coated with copper.   

114
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:12,430
  the holes are for the board's 
 various electronic components. 

115
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,366
an automated silk-screen printer

116
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,435
      now applies a diagram     
   of the electrical circuitry  

117
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,237
    in ammonia-resistant ink.   

118
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,174
       then the board goes      
into a machine called an etcher,

119
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,776
       which uses ammonia       
 to dissolve the copper coating.

120
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,980
         copper shielded        
by the ink diagram stays intact.

121
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,982
           the machine          
      then rinses the board     

122
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,518
      with sodium hydroxide     
      to dissolve the ink,      

123
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,055
     leaving behind just the    
  circuitry diagram and copper. 

124
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,058
    this copper configuration   
    will conduct electricity    

125
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,060
to the circuit-board components.

126
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,075
       automated machines       
 insert the smaller components. 

127
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:00,312
   here's what that looks like  
        in slow motion...       

128
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,449
     ...and at actual speed.    

129
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,224
      as a worker provides      
        counterpressure,        

130
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,826
 a machine folds over the leaves
    of some larger components   

131
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,963
   to secure them to the board  
     until they're soldered.    

132
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,432
   workers then install large,  
    irregular parts by hand,    

133
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,969
          among them --         
 the sockets that hold the tubes

134
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,505
     which power the amp...     

135
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,048
    ...the ribbon connecters    

136
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,018
    that join different areas   
     of the circuit board...    

137
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,258
        ...and the wires        
that connect external components

138
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,527
          to the board.         

139
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,965
 the factory permanently affixes
     everything in one shot,    

140
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,468
         using a process        
     called wave soldering.     

141
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,071
 the circuit board runs through 
 a bath of molten tin and lead. 

142
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,341
  in just a couple of seconds,  
  the liquefied metal hardens,  

143
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,144
bonding the components securely.

144
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,612
   back to that steel chassis   

145
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,614
        we saw them bend        
       into shape earlier.      

146
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,816
           since then,          
    they've painted it black.   

147
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,284
   with a silk screen printer,  

148
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,155
they apply the control markings,
  logos, and other information. 

149
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,197
 they begin the final assembly. 

150
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,100
      first, they screw the     
 circuit board into the chassis.

151
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,235
 then they plug the preamp tube 

152
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,372
   into the appropriate socket  
          on the board.         

153
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,375
 this tube boosts the electrical
  signal coming from the guitar 

154
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,844
          and feeds it          
      to the output tubes,      

155
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,646
   which up the voltage level,  

156
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,382
        making the signal       
      stronger and louder.      

157
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,051
 after installing control knobs 

158
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,519
     and covering the bottom    
         of the chassis,        

159
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,189
         workers insert         
   and clamp the output tubes,  

160
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,258
       the number of which      
         usually varies         

161
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,593
          according to          
     how many watts of power    

162
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,862
 the amp is designed to produce.

163
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,666
       the chassis housing      
the electronics goes into a box.

164
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,802
  this factory builds its boxes 

165
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,805
         from high-grade        
      baltic birch plywood,     

166
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,675
       but other companies      
often use domestic plywood, mdf,

167
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,344
        or even plastic.        

168
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,480
     after covering the box     
         in leatherette         

169
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,281
           and adding           
     corner reinforcements,     

170
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,350
          they install          
 the two remaining components --

171
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,119
      the spring reverb...      

172
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,558
       ...and the speaker.      

173
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,761
   as the guitar's electrical   
  signals run through the amp,  

174
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,429
  part of the electrical signal 

175
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,132
       diverts to one end       
  of the spring, vibrating it.  

176
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,968
     the spring's other end     
     picks up this vibration    

177
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,371
    and sends it back through   
  the amp as a delayed signal.  

178
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,641
   that reverberation combines  
    with the original signal    

179
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,643
   to produce a bigger sound.   

180
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,879
    [ mid-tempo music plays ]   

181
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,663
            narrator:           
    people have been playing    

182
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,799
        with small balls        
    of stone, clay, or marble   

183
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,468
     since ancient egyptian     
        and roman times.        

184
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,337
         today's marbles        
   are actually made of glass   

185
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,474
  and used for industrial tasks 
        as well as games.       

186
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,877
        glass is not only       
    inexpensive and durable,    

187
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,046
    but also quite beautiful.   

188
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,754
        to make marbles,        

189
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,224
   this company melts recycled  
 glass with marbles made earlier

190
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,794
          but rejected          
    for being the wrong size.   

191
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,765
    all this goes into a kiln   

192
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,668
     heated to 2,200 degrees    
           fahrenheit.          

193
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,106
after 16 hours, they open a door
   at the bottom of the kiln,   

194
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,142
 and the molten glass flows out.

195
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,381
     a shearing device cuts     
 the stream every half a second,

196
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,986
  forming segments called slugs 
      that become marbles.      

197
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,988
to make different-sized marbles,

198
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,159
  they adjust the device to cut 
 at shorter or longer intervals.

199
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,596
  the slugs slide down chutes,  

200
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:15,199
     landing between grooves    
  on spinning cast-iron rolls.  

201
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,869
  the spinning keeps the slugs  
         from sticking.         

202
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,407
      they'll need 72 hours     
       to cool completely,      

203
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,675
   but their final appearance   
         is already set.        

204
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,944
       that was determined      
        back in the kiln,       

205
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,979
        when the airflow        
         drove the heat         

206
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,149
        to melt the glass       
       and mix the colors.      

207
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,887
     these channels separate    
     the good from the bad.     

208
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,556
     openings along the way     

209
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,426
        weed out the ones       
  that are too big or too small 

210
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,062
      and collect the ones      
      that are just right.      

211
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,137
     more intricate marbles     
          are handmade.         

212
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,041
  this craftsman first preheats 
        some clear glass        

213
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,743
        in a small oven.        

214
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,249
   then he breaks off a piece   
        of colored glass.       

215
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,119
after the clear glass has melted
    in the furnace overnight,   

216
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,054
 he gathers some on a steel rod 

217
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,724
    then picks up a chunk of    
preheated colored glass with it.

218
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,061
    he forms a knob and works   
   the mass into a long string  

219
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,431
  that's up to 16 1/2 feet long 
      and thin as a noodle.     

220
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,004
he'll use them in various colors

221
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,408
   to decorate the clear glass  
      cores of the marbles.     

222
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,078
       he gathers a clump       
of melted clear glass on the rod

223
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,547
          and shapes it         
       with wet newspaper,      

224
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,682
 which won't stick to hot glass.

225
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,284
     after shaping the end,     

226
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,522
  he rolls the clump on several 
preheated colored glass strings.

227
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,227
 then it's back in the furnace. 

228
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,763
     he repeats these steps     
        up to three times       

229
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,098
       and rolls the clump      
        on a metal table        

230
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,501
 to even out the surface between
    each trip to the furnace.   

231
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,172
      then he adds a layer      
     of clear glass on top.     

232
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,910
     with another tool now,     

233
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,913
     he stretches the clump     
    to about 1 1/2 feet long.   

234
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,449
         he'll use this         
     to make several cores.     

235
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,918
    to make the second layer    
          of the core,          

236
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,920
 he rolls a 2-inch-long segment 

237
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,756
   onto colored glass slivers   
         called ribbons.        

238
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,861
       after rolling them       
  in the furnace to melt them,  

239
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,130
     he flattens the ribbons    
           with pliers          

240
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,566
    and snips off the excess    
          at the ends.          

241
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,342
        he wraps the core       
         and the ribbons        

242
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,146
   in a layer of clear glass,   
      then hand-shapes it.      

243
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,353
      now he rolls the core     
     on more glass strings.     

244
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,489
  then it's back in the furnace 
          to meld them.         

245
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,694
        he adds one more        
       clear glass layer,       

246
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,563
   and the inside is finished.  

247
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,632
  that's a total of six layers  
        for this marble.        

248
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,169
other models have fewer or more.

249
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,572
 the craftsman shapes the glass 

250
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,174
       with several metal       
        and wooden tools.       

251
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,515
    he measures the diameter    
       with metal calipers      

252
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,517
 and gradually sculpts a sphere.

253
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,720
  he'll make up to five marbles 
       from this segment,       

254
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,323
     ranging up to the size     
         of a golf ball.        

255
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,527
     after scoring the glass    
          with a knife,         

256
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,598
  he places it in the open end  
      of a pipe to hold it.     

257
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,001
  then he gently taps the rod,  

258
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,670
     which breaks the glass     
    and releases the sphere.    

259
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:44,075
 he melts away the bump left at 
 the spot where the glass broke.

260
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,610
      next, the marble goes     
          into an oven          

261
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,414
   at 986 degrees fahrenheit.   

262
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:54,018
 the oven slowly cools overnight
    to strengthen the glass.    

263
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,753
      clearly a cut above,      

264
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,222
       this eye-catching,       
       handcrafted marble       

265
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,625
  is already an object of art.  

266
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,236
            narrator:           
  an airplane propeller usually 
 has two, three, or four blades,

267
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,372
       the angles of which      
      the pilot can adjust      

268
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,840
     in response to airspeed    
     and flight conditions.     

269
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,176
    a propeller's main parts    
      are made of aluminum      

270
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,180
because it's critical to keep it
   as lightweight as possible.  

271
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,983
   the blades and hub are made  
   of aerospace-grade aluminum  

272
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,218
      that resist corrosion     
       and metal fatigue.       

273
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,527
     the propeller's blades     
        attach to a hub.        

274
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,664
    this piece of aluminum is   
on its way to becoming that hub.

275
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,933
    like the starting pieces    
         for all parts,         

276
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,801
    it was forged beforehand    

277
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,404
      into a rough version      
       of the final shape.      

278
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,007
       this sophisticated,      
      computer-guided mill      

279
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,741
     now machines the piece.    

280
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,276
        40 minutes later,       

281
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,279
  the hub is finished and ready 
   for assembly to the engine.  

282
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,748
    this roughly shaped piece   

283
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,752
       is about to become       
 one of the propeller's blades. 

284
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:06,491
     a computer-guided lathe    
 machines it to the final shape.

285
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,360
  liquid lubricant washes away  
       the metal shavings       

286
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,629
            and cools           
  the friction-generated heat.  

287
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,698
      the lathe first forms     
          the shank --          

288
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,401
      the end of the blade      
     that fits into the hub.    

289
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,108
    the next milling machine    
     cuts the blade's shape.    

290
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,527
   now the finishing steps --   

291
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:46,464
          done manually         
because they require a keen eye.

292
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,067
  workers use a rotary sander,  

293
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,868
       then a belt sander       
     to grind away the marks    

294
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,604
      the machining process     
          left behind.          

295
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,041
       they buff the metal      
    with a polishing wheel...   

296
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,547
    ...then clean the blades    

297
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,948
         by dipping them        
     in a strong detergent.     

298
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,152
 this acidic solution eats away 
    any dirt, oil, or grease    

299
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,854
  on the surface of the metal.  

300
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,360
 after that, they dip the blades

301
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,763
       in a bath of water       
        and chromic acid.       

302
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,898
      this seals the pores      
          in the metal,         

303
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,366
     fending off corrosion.     

304
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,448
 the factory tests all critical 
    parts for surface defects   

305
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,185
         by dipping them        
    in a fluorescent solution   

306
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,388
          that leaches          
     into any imperfections.    

307
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,226
         after rinsing,         
an inspection under black light.

308
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,928
        a blue glow means       
      the parts are a-okay.     

309
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,331
    any imperfections show up   
  as bright, fluorescent green. 

310
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,800
       the defective part       
       is either repaired       

311
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,270
           or rejected          
    from the production line.   

312
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,406
    blades that make the cut    
   move onto the paint shop --  

313
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,408
a coat of black on the back side

314
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,078
    to prevent sun reflection   
      into the pilot's eyes     

315
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,946
     and stripes for safety,    

316
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,149
             to make            
  the spinning blades visible.  

317
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,018
  next comes a de-icing boot -- 

318
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,887
        a rubber-encased        
    electric heating element    

319
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,689
   that prevents ice buildup.   

320
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,558
  the rubber is highly durable, 

321
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,195
   yet flexible enough to mold  
   to the curve of the blade.   

322
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:30,501
   next, they lubricate a part  
 of the blade shank with grease,

323
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,704
      then install a strong     
   steel-ball-bearing system.   

324
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,640
    this will hold the blade    
      securely in the hub,      

325
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,844
  yet still enable it to pivot  
      to change its angle.      

326
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,984
 the shanks of the three blades 

327
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,720
 fit right into this steel part 
        called the fork.        

328
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,323
     it keeps all the blades    
       at the same angle.       

329
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,729
      now for what's called     
      the pitch change rod.     

330
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,866
     the term "pitch" refers    
   to the angle of the blades.  

331
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,201
      engine oil will exert     
       hydraulic pressure       

332
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,470
     on a piston that moves     
         the pitch rod,         

333
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,138
    which advances the fork,    

334
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,942
       rotating the blades      
     to the required angle.     

335
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,211
       after removing the       
  pitch change rod temporarily, 

336
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,213
       they apply sealant       
   to the top half of the hub   

337
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,548
          and place it          
      over the bottom half      

338
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,952
          that contains         
      the ball-bearing set.     

339
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,090
      a rubber o-ring seal,     

340
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,428
 then a sturdy spring to provide
  the required counterpressure. 

341
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,901
  workers thread and torque the 
 piston and pitch change rod -- 

342
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,972
  now attached to each other -- 
          to the fork.          

343
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,310
    another rubber o-ring --    

344
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,979
    this one to prevent leaks   
 out of the top of the cylinder 

345
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,315
        that will contain       
         the engine oil.        

346
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,916
     they use a special tool    

347
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,320
 to tightly torque the cylinder 
      down against the hub.     

348
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,456
     with assembly complete,    

349
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,860
  this propeller is ready to be 
 installed on today's airplanes.
