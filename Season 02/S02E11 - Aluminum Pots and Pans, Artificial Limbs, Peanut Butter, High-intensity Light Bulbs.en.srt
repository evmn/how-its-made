00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,492
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:30,029
aluminum pots and pans, artificial limbs,

5
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,499
peanut butter, and high-intensity light bulbs.

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,772
there are several different ways

7
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,508
to manufacture aluminum pots and pans.

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,910
some factories have giant machines

9
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,712
that simply stamp out or mold the cookware,

10
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,848
while other factories

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,051
use a technique called metal spinning.

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,655
to make cookware that's safe for food use,

13
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,192
the aluminum must be pure -- no other metals mixed in.

14
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:04,063
it all starts with a round aluminum sheet called a blank.

15
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,265
they stamp the pot size and the company name

16
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,368
on what will be the bottom of the pot.

17
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,541
they clamp it onto a lathe,

18
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,944
centered against what's called the chuck --

19
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,280
a metal mold shaped like the inside of the pot

20
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,681
they're going to spin.

21
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,953
the lathe spins at 2,000 revolutions per minute.

22
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,490
guided by computer software, the spinning tool --

23
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,959
a round wheel made of special plastic --

24
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,561
pushes against the chuck,

25
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,297
stretching and shaping the aluminum blank

26
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,832
much the way potters stretch and shape clay

27
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,302
against their hand on a pottery wheel...

28
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,372
except that metal spinning works sideways,

29
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,175
not up and down like pottery.

30
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:54,646
the machine trims off excess aluminum as it rounds the edges.

31
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,850
the factory has no use for these
very sharp metal leftovers,

32
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,119
but it doesn't throw them out.

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,390
aluminum is difficult to mine and, therefore, very expensive,

34
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:09,394
so scrap aluminum is sent off to
be recycled into other products.

35
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,605
after the final trim to the finished size,

36
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,877
another trimmer moves in to take
the sharpness off the edge.

37
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:37,689
it's taken 4 minutes to spin this 8 1/2-gallon pot.

38
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,726
now it comes off the lathe.

39
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,272
they punch out handle holes...

40
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,590
...then rivet on aluminum handles.

41
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,726
the pot is now finished.

42
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:19,998
items that aren't as large and heavy are spun on a hand lathe.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,734
this is where you need an experienced metal spinner

44
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,804
because this trade isn't a mechanical science.

45
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,040
you've got to have a feel for it.

46
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,753
besides cookware,

47
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,222
many other aluminum products are spun on a lathe.

48
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,291
this is a light reflector --

49
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,094
that round aluminum fixture that covers light bulbs

50
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,663
in factories, stores, and arenas.

51
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,775
when working the hand lathe,

52
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,178
the metal spinner uses what's called a scissor tool.

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,848
it's the equivalent of the plastic wheel

54
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,683
on the automated lathe.

55
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,199
as the blank spins, he moves his
tool further and further down

56
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,202
to stretch the aluminum into the right shape.

57
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,745
this is a sausage funnel.

58
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,118
and this will be the inside tube of a cake pan.

59
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,895
he makes the body of the cake pan on a different lathe

60
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,465
using a variety of tools to get a variety of effects.

61
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,240
this beading tool creates an edge, for example.

62
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,443
almost all metals can be spun,

63
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,048
though some are better suited for the technique than others.

64
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,917
aluminum and steel are very formable metals,

65
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,687
so they provide the best results.

66
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:32,330
narrator: can a baking ingredient be the answer to global warming?

67
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,601
researchers have found a way to transform harmful carbon dioxide

68
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,472
into harmless sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda.

69
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,341
they mix co2 with water

70
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,276
then force it through plastic balls

71
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,046
treated with an enzyme from alfalfa.

72
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,621
today's artificial limbs are a far cry

73
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,690
from the wooden leg of yesteryear.

74
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,092
they look very realistic.

75
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,095
and thanks to advances in prosthetic technology,

76
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,300
artificial limbs function more and more like the real thing.

77
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,444
they start by measuring the amputee's stump --

78
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,047
what doctors call the residual limb.

79
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,515
first, they measure the circumference

80
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,852
at different points...

81
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,922
then the diameter at different points.

82
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,993
they protect and lubricate the residual limb

83
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,165
by coating it in petroleum jelly.

84
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,534
then they immerse it in algin,

85
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:46,138
a gelatinlike substance that comes from algae.

86
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:59,350
after about 5 minutes, they remove the residual limb.

87
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,853
the algin has already begun to stiffen

88
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,488
and maintain the limb's shape.

89
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,492
a couple of hours later,

90
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,495
it's stiff enough to be used as a negative mold.

91
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:15,967
they pour in plaster of paris then insert a metal rod.

92
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,836
the rod is what will later allow them

93
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,440
to mount the dried plaster to work on it further.

94
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,979
the plaster takes about an hour and a half to harden.

95
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,415
they cut off the algin.

96
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,928
then, using sandpaper and files,

97
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,864
they refine and smooth the surface.

98
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,266
this plaster copy of the residual limb

99
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,669
will now be used as a positive mold

100
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,171
to cast the artificial limb.

101
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,277
sometimes they use a different technique

102
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,413
to make the positive mold.

103
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,014
they build a negative mold

104
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,750
using strips of plasterized cloth,

105
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,619
much the same way they make a plaster cast

106
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,589
when you break your leg.

107
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:19,030
then a scanner takes a detailed 3-dimensional reading

108
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:23,301
and programs it into a computer.

109
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,714
a technician then makes any necessary modifications.

110
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,386
they put a plaster block on a cutting machine.

111
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,965
the computer guides the blade to carve out the positive mold.

112
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,280
with either technique, once the positive mold is ready,

113
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,481
they can make the artificial limb.

114
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,618
the process they use is called lamination.

115
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,821
first, they cover the mold in fabric socks --

116
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,890
some made of nylon,

117
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,893
others of a material that contains fiberglass.

118
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,762
they layer 6 to 10 socks in all,

119
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,866
depending on how rigid they want the artificial limb to be.

120
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,436
then they coat the socks

121
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,039
with a liquid resin made of either polyester or acrylic.

122
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,042
here they're using acrylic

123
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,911
tinted to look like caucasian skin.

124
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,515
it's important to ensure the surface is evenly soaked.

125
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:49,254
it's a meticulous process that takes about an hour.

126
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,324
the acrylic solidifies in about an hour.

127
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,859
polyester takes about 12 hours.

128
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,395
they then break the plaster mold inside,

129
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,865
leaving a durable plastic shell
called a socket.

130
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:05,136
that will be the basis of the artificial limb.

131
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,139
the socket connects to another plastic shell

132
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,874
containing the mechanics,

133
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,811
or, like this artificial leg, the mechanism can be modular

134
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,014
and covered in just a skin-colored foam.

135
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:21,152
if the muscle at the site of the amputation

136
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,689
still emits a good electrical signal when contracted,

137
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,959
the patient can get a myoelectric prosthesis.

138
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,160
it has an electrode

139
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,629
that captures and amplifies the signal,

140
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,400
triggering the artificial hand to open and close.

141
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,512
narrator: as early as the 1400s,
africans made peanut stews.

142
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,314
peanut butter, as we know it today,

143
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,852
was invented in 1890 by an american doctor.

144
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,920
he used it as a protein substitute

145
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,591
for people whose teeth were so bad they couldn't chew meat.

146
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:03,194
the best peanuts for making peanut butter

147
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,796
are runner peanuts.

148
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,664
because they're uniform in size,

149
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,667
they roast more evenly than peanuts that vary in size.

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,606
they arrive at the peanut-butter
factory already shelled.

151
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,475
to make an 18-ounce jar of peanut butter,

152
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,078
it takes 20 ounces of peanuts.

153
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,847
that's about 1,100 peanuts.

154
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,351
the first step is to roast them.

155
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,153
the nuts travel through a hot-air roaster

156
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,224
heated to 399 degrees fahrenheit.

157
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:37,495
the shaking motion moves them around so they roast evenly.

158
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,900
almost 4 tons of peanuts go through this roaster per hour.

159
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,169
when they come out,

160
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,005
they've turned from white to light brown.

161
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,181
next, they go into another machine,

162
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,116
which fast-cools them at room temperature

163
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,987
using suction fans that circulate air quickly.

164
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,124
this rapid-cooling process is critical.

165
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,992
it halts the cooking

166
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:12,664
and prevents the peanuts from losing too much oil.

167
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,534
next, the peanuts go through a machine called the blancher.

168
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,068
it removes the outer skins

169
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,271
by rubbing them between rubber belts.

170
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,875
then it splits the kernels and removes the heart of the peanut,

171
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,946
which has a slightly bitter taste.

172
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,082
but what's discarded doesn't go to waste.

173
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,152
the skins go to farmers for pig feed,

174
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,255
and the hearts go into bird feed.

175
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,905
the peanuts land in a big stainless-steel hopper.

176
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,387
from there, they drop down into the grinder

177
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,691
to be ground into a paste.

178
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,006
at this point, the other ingredients go in --

179
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:31,409
salt, sugar or another natural sweetener,

180
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,546
and a small amount of hydrogenated vegetable oil,

181
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,949
which acts as a stabilizer to keep the peanut oil

182
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:41,819
from separating and floating to the top of the jar.

183
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,756
peanut butter contains no artificial coloring

184
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,157
or artificial sweeteners.

185
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,092
it has no preservatives either,

186
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:50,762
yet doesn't need to be refrigerated.

187
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,232
the peanut butter is finally ready.

188
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,904
all that mixing has heated it up
to 140 degrees fahrenheit.

189
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,975
it goes through a cooling system
to bring it down to 100 degrees.

190
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,778
now it can go into jars.

191
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,849
peanut butter is a healthy, protein-rich food

192
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:16,921
with plenty of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

193
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,458
it has no cholesterol, but it does contain fat.

194
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,993
the good news is

195
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,063
that more than 80% of that fat is unsaturated --

196
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,999
in other words, good fat that may actually help

197
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,534
lower certain cholesterol levels
in the blood.

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,405
the bad news is that the rest of the fat content is trans fat,

199
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,474
or bad fat.

200
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,676
it comes not from the peanuts themselves

201
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,479
but from the hydrogenated vegetable oil

202
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,481
that's used as the stabilizer

203
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,549
to keep the peanut oil from separating.

204
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,618
if you want to avoid that,

205
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,421
you can eat all-natural peanut butter,

206
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,756
which doesn't contain a stabilizer.

207
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,492
you'll just have to stir the peanut oil

208
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,761
that collects at the top of the jar.

209
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,697
once the jars are filled with peanut butter,

210
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,499
they go through the capping machine.

211
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,435
the caps have an aluminum seal inside.

212
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,038
as the caps pass through a heat machine,

213
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,441
the seal drops down and adheres
to the top of the jar,

214
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,977
creating an airtight seal.

215
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:20,919
a machine prints the production
date and the expiration date.

216
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,120
these unopened jars of peanut butter

217
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,157
will stay fresh for one whole year.

218
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,469
narrator: a household light bulb creates light through a metal filament.

219
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,672
a high-intensity industrial light bulb

220
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,406
uses not only a metal filament

221
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,276
but also coils, electrodes, and mercury vapor.

222
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,477
it's more durable

223
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,214
but needs a cooldown period before relighting.

224
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:01,225
in 1809, a british chemist invented electric light.

225
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,494
over the next few decades,

226
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,897
other inventors produced electric lamps and bulbs,

227
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,034
but the light didn't last very long.

228
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,371
the big breakthrough came in 1879,

229
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,174
when thomas edison invented a carbon filament

230
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,776
that burned for 40 hours.

231
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,912
then, just a year later,

232
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:24,716
he produced a bulb that burned for more than 1,200 hours.

233
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:28,252
that finally made electric lighting feasible.

234
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,665
they start by making the coil support.

235
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,468
later, they'll thread the filament through the support.

236
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,404
they take a glass rod about a half an inch long

237
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:52,210
and heat it up enough to insert
a pin just 1/1,000 inch thick.

238
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,746
the pin is made of tungsten,

239
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,016
a hard metal that won't melt under high heat.

240
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,953
the rod and pin go into a machine that heats the glass

241
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,623
and pressures it into a mushroom shape.

242
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,898
they insert 3 or 6 wires just .0005 inches thick,

243
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,468
depending on the model of light bulb.

244
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,053
they cut the wires to the required length,

245
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,456
which also depends on the model.

246
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,060
then they curl the ends into little circles.

247
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:49,000
the coil support is finished.

248
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,335
next, they build the mount

249
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,006
onto which several other parts will be assembled.

250
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,607
they weld on the arc tube --

251
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:02,280
a quartz tube containing a coil,
electrodes, gas, and mercury.

252
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,150
next, they weld on the bimetal switch,

253
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,053
which cuts the current to the coil and the arc tube.

254
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,993
then they weld on the coil support they prepared earlier.

255
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,235
they bend the coil support down
to receive the filament,

256
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,337
which is made of tungsten.

257
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,576
now they weld one end of the filament to the mount

258
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,910
and feed the other end

259
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,580
through the little circles of the coil support...

260
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,253
...then weld it to the other side of the mount.

261
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,590
the mount is now fully assembled.

262
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,663
next, they apply a specific amount of pressure

263
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,832
to the bimetal switch to calibrate it.

264
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,540
they submerge the finished mount in alcohol

265
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,209
to remove any dust or other contaminants.

266
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,144
they let it dry for 10 minutes

267
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,080
then apply a liquid called zirconium getter.

268
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,217
this draws moisture away from the filament.

269
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,554
it's finally time to put the mount in the glass bulb.

270
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:20,424
the sealing machine cuts off excess glass from the bottom

271
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,560
then melts what's left until it attaches to the mount.

272
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,029
how will this light bulb work?

273
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,631
the electric current travels through the filament

274
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,967
to the coil inside the arc tube.

275
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,303
the coil warms gases,

276
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,305
which then vaporize the small amount of mercury.

277
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,975
the mercury vapor then conducts the current

278
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,245
from one electrode to another, creating light.

279
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,147
the bulbs are made into different shapes and sizes.

280
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,717
a machine blows air in the hot glass

281
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,518
while a mold creates the form.

282
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,455
a special flame lets the glass cool slowly

283
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,590
so it won't become brittle from the stress.

284
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,660
they print the wattage and voltage on the bulbs,

285
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,797
then run them through an oven at 932 degrees fahrenheit

286
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,201
to draw out any humidity or impurities

287
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,068
that may be caught inside.

288
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,005
then they go through what's called the tipping torch.

289
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,673
it seals in nitrogen gas,

290
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,542
which prevents the filament from overheating.

291
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,346
now the bulb is ready for its first test --

292
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,883
a 10-minute burn to make sure it operates properly

293
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,818
and there's no air inside.

294
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,821
finally, it's time to attach the socket.

295
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:28,359
they apply cement on the base then hook up the bulb.

296
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,839
the bulb passes through a flame
that cures the cement.

297
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,045
the next machine cleans the socket with acid...

298
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,584
...so it can be soldered at two points.

299
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:59,590
the finished bulbs are put aside for 48 hours

300
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,027
then retested before being shipped out.

301
