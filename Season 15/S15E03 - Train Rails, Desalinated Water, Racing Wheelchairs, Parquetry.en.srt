00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,253
narrator: in the early days of the railroad,         

2
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,657
train rails were made of either cast iron or wrought iron.    

3
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,726
cast iron was too brittle and would break easily.     

4
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,263
wrought iron was too soft and would wear out too quickly.            

5
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,666
so steel eventually became and remained           

6
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:09,101
the train-rail metal of choice.             

7
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,542
the train wheel's rim      
runs on the inside of the rail  

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,145
to keep the train on the track.             

9
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,082
this plant makes train rails  
entirely out of recycled steel  

10
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,485
from scrapyards, food cans,   

11
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:30,356
and recycled pieces from the rail-making process itself.             

12
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:38,096
electromagnets pick up the scrap              

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,266
and dump it in a charging bucket.      

14
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,704
a truck hauls the bucket inside,             

15
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:48,774
where a crane drops the contents into a furnace.         

16
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,643
an intense electric current   

17
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:54,747
melts the scrap steel at 3,000 degrees fahrenheit.   

18
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,985
it then flows into a large brick-lined ladle,    

19
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,389
where they add carbon, manganese, and other elements  

20
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,925
to make the steel more durable.            

21
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:09,128
the alloy then runs down a ceramic tube          

22
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,664
that shields it from exposure to oxygen,     

23
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,934
which would ruin the metal.   

24
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,870
from there, the molten metal flows into molds,        

25
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,806
which extrude it into continuous rectangular blocks        

26
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,675
called blooms.          

27
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,482
acetylene torches cut each bloom into 12-foot lengths.      

28
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,024
a crane then transfers the blooms to a furnace,     

29
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,293
which, over the next five to seven hours,         

30
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:45,498
reheats them to 2,300 degrees fahrenheit.   

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,367
this softens the steel for further shaping.       

32
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:56,776
then the reheated blooms enter a machine called a rolling mill,              

33
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:01,180
which elongates each bloom, more than quadrupling its length.   

34
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:09,088
a shear then slices the longer, thinner blooms into four pieces.             

35
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,668
the pieces now go into     
another furnace for reheating.  

36
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,471
this preps them for the next set of rolling mills,        

37
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,809
which will gradually form them to the final rail shape.     

38
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,282
different railroads used to use different-shaped rails,     

39
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,750
which required changing the train's wheels        

40
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,187
when passing from one railway to another.           

41
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,955
by the turn of the 20th century,            

42
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,491
the t-shaped rail became the industry standard   

43
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,061
and remains so today.      

44
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,833
for the final shaping, each steel rail         

45
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,404
passes several times through three consecutive mills.             

46
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,578
this is what a mill's rollers look like.            

47
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,713
and here's the standard "t" shape            

48
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,249
to which they form the steel.  

49
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:19,057
next, a saw slices off about 12               
inches to square off the ends.  

50
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,060
the cut-off pieces go back to the scrapyard.        

51
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:24,530
the rails, meanwhile, are laid out           

52
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,533
until they cool to about 930 degrees fahrenheit.           

53
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,004
then an electromagnet piles them in a holding box,   

54
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,606
where they sit for 10 hours   

55
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,609
until they cool off to about 190 degrees fahrenheit.           

56
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,545
when they come out of the box,  

57
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,347
they run through two sets of rollers.       

58
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,184
the first set flexes the rail vertically.   

59
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,889
the second, horizontally.    

60
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,491
this flexing process       

61
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,294
straightens out the rails, which curve slightly       

62
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,163
due to all that heating, shaping, and cooling.      

63
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,966
next, each rail passes over a mirror,      

64
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,371
enabling inspectors to examine the bottom, as well as the top.              

65
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,842
finally, a saw cuts the rails  

66
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,511
to whatever size the railway ordered --      

67
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,748
most often the standard length of 82 feet.           

68
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,120
the quality-control department measures random samples     

69
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:23,856
to make sure all the dimensions are precise.            

70
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,124
every rail bears a number    

71
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,261
identifying the batch of steel from which it came.       

72
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,664
in the event of a problem, that number           

73
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,267
lets them trace all the rails made from the same batch.    

74
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,071
it's a system that ensures a safe, smooth ride.       

75
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,489
narrator: in regions where fresh drinking water is limited,            

76
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,559
desalination plants remove salt from seawater,    

77
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:04,362
converting it into freshwater suitable for human consumption.          

78
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,166
there are more than 13,000   
desalination plants worldwide,  

79
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,437
producing 12 billion gallons of water a day.         

80
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:21,313
the desalination plant that produced this drinkable water  

81
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,516
is located right next to an electrical power plant   

82
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:29,321
which uses seawater to cool down its condensers.   

83
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,991
post-cooling, the water travels via underground pipes      

84
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:34,927
to the desalination plant.    

85
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,730
before salt extraction, the water is pretreated     

86
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,599
in a multiphase cleaning process.        

87
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,135
first, the water flows through screens         

88
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,572
that filter out large debris.  

89
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,878
from there, it flows into basins             

90
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,513
for the first pretreatment stage.       

91
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,283
as large paddles agitate the water,        

92
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,685
the plant adds two chemicals --               

93
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,888
sodium hypochlorite, a disinfectant,         

94
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,225
and ferric chloride, a coagulant.           

95
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,627
the coagulant binds together sand       

96
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,096
and other tiny particles of debris,            

97
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,300
forming heavier clumps that sink to the bottom.     

98
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,904
this removes a significant portion of dirt from the water,             

99
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,308
but it's still far from being crystal clear.    

100
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,580
the water now moves into another set of basins    

101
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,584
for the second pretreatment phase -- sand filtering.     

102
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,854
inside each sand filter,     

103
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,923
regulated by various pressure and flow gauges,    

104
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,058
a steady stream of air      

105
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,063
continually moves sand in a circular motion.      

106
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,135
the seawater enters at the bottom of each filter   

107
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,870
and flows to the top.      

108
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,273
as the sand moves downward against the rising water,    

109
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,544
the dirt particles attach to the sand.       

110
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,254
the seawater now looks clean   

111
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,591
but still contains microscopic particles.      

112
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,229
so it enters the final pretreatment phase.       

113
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,233
this time, the filtering medium is diatomaceous earth,      

114
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,637
a powdered rock that contains algae fossils.   

115
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,909
finer than sand, it filters out those microscopic particles.   

116
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,711
the seawater is now perfectly clean      

117
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,783
and ready for salt extraction.  

118
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:40,719
they do that using membranes --               

119
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,188
cylinders containing layers of plastic sheets        

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,459
that have pores .001 the diameter of a human hair,  

121
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:51,530
small enough to trap microscopic salt crystals.    

122
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,665
the plant pumps the clean saltwater    

123
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,136
under extremely high pressure through long tubes,       

124
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:59,938
each of which contains eight membranes.         

125
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,142
by the time the water passes through all the membranes            

126
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:07,546
and reaches the center of the tube, it's completely salt-free.           

127
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,215
plant personnel and a slew of sophisticated instruments   

128
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:15,754
continually monitor every one of               
the system's 10,000 membranes.  

129
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,994
meanwhile, the plant sends the debris removed earlier             

130
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,630
to large waste basins      

131
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,665
for another round of chemical treatment.      

132
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,502
after the solids settle to the bottom,      

133
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,305
the dirty water goes back to the front of the plant    

134
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,140
to be cleaned and recycled.   

135
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,788
pressure rollers squeeze the remaining water       

136
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,690
out of the solids.        

137
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,995
trucks then transport the dry solids to a landfill.  

138
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:00,799
the extracted salt, meanwhile, goes to the power plant,     

139
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,002
which dilutes it, then returns it to the sea    

140
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,372
in a way that doesn't upset the water's natural salinity level.             

141
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,612
processing saltwater into freshwater         

142
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,549
strips away the water's natural minerals.  

143
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,885
not replacing them would create two problems.    

144
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,755
first, the water wouldn't taste right.             

145
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,892
second, it would damage metal pipes   

146
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:30,428
by aggressively trying to replace the missing minerals.            

147
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,431
therefore, the plant adds    
liquid lime and carbon dioxide  

148
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,300
to the water.          

149
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,971
these two elements adjust the ph level and raise the alkalinity,           

150
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:42,074
restoring the minerals and natural taste.        

151
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,724
narrator: world war ii veterans disabled in combat        

152
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,994
were the first to race in wheelchairs.         

153
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,596
but those chairs were clunky, steel models.          

154
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,532
fast-forward to today and wheelchair racing      

155
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,401
is a serious sport with aerodynamic chairs.     

156
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,071
these chairs have elongated mainframes    

157
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,841
and three wheels instead of four.         

158
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,545
this modern racing chair is tailored           

159
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,415
to the athlete's physique, specific disability,       

160
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,351
and skill level.         

161
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,421
they begin by taking detailed measurements of the athlete   

162
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,490
as she sits in a demo chair.   

163
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:35,027
they measure the width and height of her knees     

164
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,829
to determine the best seating position.    

165
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,166
they check the balance point   

166
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:44,369
to decide how the rear-wheel axle should be positioned,    

167
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,040
and they measure her arms so push rims can be sized for her.              

168
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,441
they then produce a digital drawing        

169
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,377
of the racing wheelchair,    

170
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,614
complete with any extras requested by the athlete.    

171
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,789
the fabricator selects the appropriate aluminum tubing             

172
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,058
and cuts it to the desired length.      

173
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,130
this one will be the main tube for the racing chair's frame.  

174
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,266
rollers curve the tube slightly at one end            

175
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:17,169
so the framework will accommodate the seat.    

176
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,877
a press then flattens the tube quite a bit.           

177
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,278
this stiffens the metal     

178
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,015
and will make the racing-chair frame more aerodynamic.     

179
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,620
this small tube, which they weld to the main tube,        

180
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:37,322
will hold the racing chair's steering fork.          

181
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,031
he now tapes a steering mechanism for the front wheel  

182
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,699
onto the framework        

183
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:51,470
and confirms that its placement is exact before welding.     

184
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,174
this device will keep the front wheel on autopilot,  

185
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,645
freeing the racer's hands to push the rear wheels.     

186
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,649
the welder now positions    
the other end of the main tube  

187
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,252
perpendicular to the wheel axle.              

188
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,057
he inches the tube       
towards the center of the axle  

189
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,394
until it's right on the mark.  

190
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,462
he welds the axle to the main tube,        

191
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,132
giving the framework a "t" profile.          

192
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,537
temporary wheels lift the axle  

193
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,407
so he can install the seat frame.         

194
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,377
then a hydraulic machine bends an aluminum tube      

195
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,981
into a "u" shape to make    
the racing chair's seat frame.  

196
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,888
he positions the seat frame on the rear axle         

197
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,290
and does a few more welds.    

198
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,929
finally, he installs fenders on the wheels.          

199
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,438
the main framework of this   
racing wheelchair is complete.  

200
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,041
but to make it look flashy, they spray-paint it red.     

201
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,710
this is a powder coating.    

202
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,379
it's a thermoplastic paint    

203
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,881
that's tougher than the conventional kind.   

204
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,053
next, this machine rolls the push rims,          

205
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,856
which the athlete uses to propel the wheelchair.    

206
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,666
they weld on pegs for attaching the rims to the wheels,     

207
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:32,069
then glue a rubber sleeve onto each rim.          

208
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,340
they wrap it in tape to clamp the two as the glue dries.    

209
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,674
the tape stays on        

210
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,511
until the chair is delivered to the customer.         

211
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,482
they install the rear wheels at an angle           

212
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,184
to make the racing chair more stable when cornering.   

213
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,089
they add padding for the athlete's knees,     

214
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,560
then assemble the nylon seat to the chair.          

215
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,197
next comes the front-wheel steering fork and handle.    

216
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,438
they complete the assembly   
with a spring-loaded cylinder.  

217
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,907
that's part of         
the steering autopilot system.  

218
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:17,115
after testing the steering fork, they install the front wheel,  

219
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,084
which is smaller than the rear two.        

220
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,324
once it's been equipped with brakes,           

221
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,926
this custom racing chair     

222
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,995
is ready to take on the competition.         

223
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,666
an elite athlete will buy    
a new racing chair every year.  

224
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:38,470
some choose rear wheels made of lightweight carbon fiber              

225
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:42,674
because any advantage      
is welcome in the push to win.  

226
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,225
narrator: parquetry was invented      

227
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,528
in france in the 1600s as an alternative        

228
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,630
to high-maintenance marble flooring.         

229
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,832
it's made from small pieces of wood    

230
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,368
bonded together in a geometric pattern.     

231
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,370
the most common motif is squares.           

232
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,706
but it also comes in other patterns,        

233
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,376
such as herringbone, lozenges, and triangles.     

234
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,650
parquetry can be made of laminate or plywood.     

235
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,919
however, the best-quality flooring    

236
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:33,791
is made from genuine wood, such as oak, maple, or yellow birch.             

237
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,595
the factory first cuts the wood into planks,           

238
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,665
measuring 2 to 5 inches wide by about a yard long.      

239
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,404
a drum saw then cuts each plank              

240
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,073
into 6 blocks about 6 inches long       

241
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,377
while an inspector discards any misshapen ones.   

242
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,815
the blocks then move through a planer         

243
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:02,621
that shaves a fine layer off both sides.         

244
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:06,357
this reduces the blocks to a thickness of just under an inch              

245
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,694
and smoothes the top and bottom surfaces.       

246
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,496
next, the blocks run through a saw   

247
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,499
with 10 blades that slice them into strips   

248
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,103
measuring .3 inches wide by 6.2 inches long.       

249
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,580
quality controllers remove any strips        

250
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,448
with inconsistent thickness,   

251
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,786
which are usually the ones cut from the block's extremities.  

252
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,321
the good strips continue on to another area,         

253
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,257
where they undergo a more thorough         

254
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,493
quality-control inspection.   

255
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,731
a worker checks the tops and bottoms,      

256
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,401
then lines them up on a conveyor belt good-side up.               

257
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,405
she also discards any substandard strips      

258
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,207
that may have slipped past the first inspection.      

259
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:03,281
the conveyor belt then flips the strips over.   

260
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,651
this positions the strips underside facing upward.     

261
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,626
saws then cut two parallel grooves through them.      

262
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:18,063
these grooves are set .9 inches in from the edge...       

263
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,170
...and are just deep enough to hold a thin aluminum wire   

264
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,506
that'll connect strips together to form tiles.          

265
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:33,144
the next machine dispenses the parallel wires.  

266
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:42,586
a wheel pushes the wires deep inside their respective grooves.            

267
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,322
after every seven strips,    

268
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,459
the machine cuts the wires and starts new ones.       

269
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:52,297
the 7-length strips form a 6-inch-square tile.    

270
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,136
an end-matching machine now squares each tile      

271
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:02,006
so that the four corners are precisely 90 degrees.    

272
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:05,877
then it carves tongues on two of the tile's edges    

273
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,446
and grooves into the other two.              

274
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,952
four tile feeders then drop   
tiles into an assembly machine  

275
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:19,290
that inserts the tongues into the grooves.        

276
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,492
the machine then applies hot glue             

277
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,562
which bonds the four tiles into one larger tile       

278
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,465
measuring 12x12 inches.     

279
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,907
the tiles are now ready for varnishing.         

280
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,577
feeders drop them onto     
the automated varnishing line.  

281
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,055
the tile surface gets a sanding.            

282
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,799
rollers then apply an even coat of varnish.     

283
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,335
from there, the tiles immediately pass under      

284
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,003
ultraviolet light.        

285
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,941
this dries the varnish within a second.         

286
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,477
then the process repeats three more times     

287
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,680
for a total of four coats of varnish.           

288
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,282
workers then stack them in 10s,              

289
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,352
at the same time doing a final inspection     

290
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,022
and discarding any tile that has a less-than-perfect finish.             

291
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,224
on the packaging line,      

292
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,862
each stack gets a label and clear plastic wrapping.   

293
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,267
an oven shrinks the plastic tightly around the tiles.    

294
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,240
those four coats of varnish made this parquetry superdurable,   

295
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,443
and because it's real wood,   

296
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,513
when the many years of wear do begin to show,        

297
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,250
you can simply refinish the floor to its original splendor.            

298
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,320
