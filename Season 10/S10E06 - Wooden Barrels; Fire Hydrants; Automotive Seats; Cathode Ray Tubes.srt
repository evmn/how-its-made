"how it's made"...              
wooden barrels...               
fire hydrants...

in the old days, wooden barrels

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,159
simply because they were easy to
move.                           
if you couldn't lift them, you  

10
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,460
move.                           
if you couldn't lift them, you  
could roll them.                

11
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,629
if you couldn't lift them, you  
could roll them.                
today modern machinery has made

00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,101
barrels obsolete, except for    
storing fine wine and spirits.  
and so the time-honored

oak cut into pieces called      
staves.                         
the staves go into a planer that

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,940
holes to hold the staves        
together.                       
workers take the staves, place

00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,909
together.                       
workers take the staves, place  
them on a guide, and press them

a smaller piece completes the

a smaller piece completes the   
shape.                          
now it's onto the rounder, a

shape.

circular shape.                 

40

machine that cuts it into a     
circular shape.                 
this creates the barrel's lid,  

41
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,360
circular shape.                 
this creates the barrel's lid,  
or head, as it's called.        

42
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,463
this creates the barrel's lid,  
or head, as it's called.        
and each barrel requires two,   

43
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,732
or head, as it's called.        
and each barrel requires two,   
one for the top and one for the

one for the top and one for the 
bottom.                         
the barrel head now goes onto a 

46
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,603
bottom.                         
the barrel head now goes onto a 
contraption called the char

00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,737
the barrel head now goes onto a 
contraption called the char

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,541
contraption called the char     
tunnel.                         
its gas burners scorch the wood.

tunnel.                         
its gas burners scorch the wood.
this charring not only changes

this charring not only changes  
the wood's appearance, it also  

51
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,812
this charring not only changes

the workers coat the head's edge

they run the staves against this
machine to narrow their ends.   

60
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,398
they run the staves against this
machine to narrow their ends.   
this gives the barrel its       

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
machine to narrow their ends.   
this gives the barrel its       
characteristic shape, with a    

62
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,568
this gives the barrel its       
characteristic shape, with a    
smaller radius at the ends than 

63
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,938
characteristic shape, with a    
smaller radius at the ends than

00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,542
in the middle.                  
at the barrel-raising station, a
worker positions an iron hoop

00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,110
at the barrel-raising station, a
worker positions an iron hoop   
and starts to assemble the

00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,311
worker positions an iron hoop   
and starts to assemble the

68
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,213
and starts to assemble the

width in order to use as few as 
possible.                       
this reduces the numbers of

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,587
possible.                       
this reduces the numbers of     
joints and potential leak       

73
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:13,391
this reduces the numbers of

if he pulls that dry wood too   
tight, it will break into       

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,199
if he pulls that dry wood too

a loose hoop gives the wood room

pieces.                         
a loose hoop gives the wood room

next, the barrels pass through a

00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,740
to expand.                      
next, the barrels pass through a
steam tunnel for about 15       

83
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,474
next, the barrels pass through a

steam tunnel for about 15       
minutes.                        
this adds moisture to the wood

00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:39,151
minutes.                        
this adds moisture to the wood  
so it can flex without snapping.

86
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,052
this adds moisture to the wood  
so it can flex without snapping.
workers pull out the barrel and 

87
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,689
so it can flex without snapping.
workers pull out the barrel and 
remove the top and bottom hoops.

88
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,957
workers pull out the barrel and 
remove the top and bottom hoops.
sturdier hoops replace them and 

89
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,492
remove the top and bottom hoops.
sturdier hoops replace them and 
are hammered into place.        

90
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,294
sturdier hoops replace them and 
are hammered into place.        
without them, the barrel would

00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,230
are hammered into place.        
without them, the barrel would  
spring apart.

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,844
next, two more hoops around the 
body.                           
the wood groans from the intense

body.                           
the wood groans from the intense
pressure that forces the staves 

94
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,781
the wood groans from the intense
pressure that forces the staves 
together, but there can't be any

00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,749
pressure that forces the staves 
together, but there can't be any

96
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,920
together, but there can't be any
gaps between the staves or else

then he applies an electrical   
current to the coil.            

415
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,127
then he applies an electrical

it evaporates the aluminum      

416
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,428

it evaporates the aluminum      
pellet, which spreads a         

417
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,896
it evaporates the aluminum

421
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,143
now they heat the bulb to 425

this bakes out the lacquer and  

422
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:12,482
degrees fahrenheit for one hour.
this bakes out the lacquer and  
any trace of moisture.          

423
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,685

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,162
a worker aligns and fuses a

then he paints it with the same 
conductive coating.             

428
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,638

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,912
it shoots electrons at the

screen.                         
then using beading glass, they  
align and fuse them into        

440
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,394
then using beading glass, they  
align and fuse them into

00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:09,940
electron-gun components.        
then the gun is cooled with     
pressurized air.                

446

464
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,390
to minimize image flicker over  

465
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,291
