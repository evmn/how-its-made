00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,719
narrator: hockey skates are not all created equal.   

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,189
that's why professional hockey players         

3
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,392
are always looking for ways to get that cutting edge.   

4
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,861
they know championships are won or lost        

5
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,530
in fractions of a second,   

6
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,732
and that's when heated skate blades      

7
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,268
can make all the difference.  

8
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,806
with a simple touch,      

9
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,075
heated skate blades are revolutionizing      

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,410
the game of hockey.      

11
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,746
they give much more control and speed on the ice.     

12
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,215
they do this using a smart board,      

13
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,486
the brain of these performance-enhancing blades. 

14
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,956
it all starts with custom-made,
stainless-steel blades.    

15
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,159
a technician places them inside
an injection-molding machine. 

16
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,763
liquid plastic is injected into a cavity,   

17
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,299
creating a plastic overmold.  

18
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,439
once bonded with the overmold, 

19
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,508
the blades are ready to receive
the electronic smart board.  

20
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,713
the smart board fits into the plastic overmold      

21
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,516
that runs along the top edge of the blade.         

22
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,719
after removing excess plastic from the mold,         

23
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,855
the technician places the prepared blades      

24
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,592
onto a mounting tray.     

25
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,393
he uses thermoconductive glue 

26
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,396
to ensure contact between the heating wire,   

27
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,398
the temperature-controlling smart board,          

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,334
and the blade overmold.    

29
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,204
after that, the technician inserts insulating material  

30
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,540
along the entire length of the overmold        

31
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,676
so the heating wires make perfect contact with the steel.

32
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:28,013
once the smart board is secure,

33
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,814
the technical places the blades

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,017
into a low-density injection machine        

35
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,219
that encapsulates the smart board        

36
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,755
with impact- and moisture-resistant resin.   

37
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,424
the smart board is now waterproof.       

38
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,097
meanwhile, another high-pressure
injection-molding machine   

39
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,234
makes the blade holders that support the finished blades.  

40
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:52,171
these blade holders will be given an actual power supply --

41
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,373
a high-performance lithium-polymer        

42
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,709
rechargeable battery that makes
heating the blades possible.  

43
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,312
the battery will be cleverly concealed   

44
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,081
inside the heel of that molded chassis.    

45
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,056
to do this, a technician first attaches rivets     

46
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,325
into the heels of the blade holders,     

47
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:18,130
then mounts the blade holders onto an automatic rivet press. 

48
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,399
this machine pressure-punches the rivets           

49
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,268
so they will make a proper connection to the battery    

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,671
for recharging.        

51
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:31,543
a printer heat-presses the brand
name and logo on the heel.   

52
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,413
the logo sits over the flexible proximity sensor, 

53
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,014
or the on-and-off button    

54
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,084
that a technician wraps around the battery.   

55
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,752
then she buries the combined unit       

56
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,620
into the heel of the blade holder      

57
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,690
to protect it from moisture and impact.          

58
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:48,560
she then locks it into place. 

59
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,231
next, the technician attaches a threaded insert bolt     

60
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,966
to the blade overmold.     

61
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,635
this special bolt hold the blade in place    

62
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,871
and allows for quick and easy blade changing.        

63
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,646
the technician then connects the blade to the blade holder 

64
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,783
and presses the blade firmly into the chassis.    

65
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,786
then she locks all electronic and mechanical components   

66
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,656
into place.          

67
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:22,527
a charging unit powers up the battery for testing.    

68
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,463
then the technician seals off the heel chamber        

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,598
to further protect the battery.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,870
she turns on the smart board to
make sure all systems are go. 

71
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,407
an l.e.d. confirms the blades are heating properly.     

72
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,545
in the meantime, another technician       

73
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,082
assembles the molded charging unit for the blades. 

74
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,285
the technician hand-trims the motherboard   

75
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,087
that controls the charger   

76
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,658
so it will fit flawlessly into the charging unit.    

77
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,495
she inserts the finished motherboard    

78
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,630
into the back of the unit   

79
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,600
and checks to make sure it works properly.       

80
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,105
then she snaps on an airtight cover that seals the unit,   

81
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,276
fully protecting the motherboard
against wetness and shock.   

82
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:14,112
finally, she plugs in the charging unit       

83
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,115
to confirm it works.      

84
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,718
a rechargeable battery, a manual,           

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,520
a convenient charging unit, and a pair           

86
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,459
of performance-enhancing skate blades complete the kit. 

87
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:32,797
they heated skate blades are now
ready to ship around the world. 

88
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,400
they're quick and easy to mount on the boot,      

89
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:39,538
with the built-in smarts to help
create the next champion.   

90
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,752
narrator: gliding involves flying unpowered aircraft,   

91
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,420
though some models are fitted with a small engine      

92
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,821
and propeller         

93
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,091
so they have the power to launch
into the air on their own.   

94
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,592
no matter what the model,   

95
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,029
the sport of gliding is all about the joy      

96
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,031
of using the forces      
of the atmosphere to fly higher,

97
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,368
faster, and longer.      

98
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,241
gliders, like this model version,    

99
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:20,178
have three main parts -- wings, fuselage, and tail.   

100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,314
workers build each part of the glider in two pieces,  

101
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,184
using resin and steel molds.  

102
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,587
they begin with the fuselage mold.    

103
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,455
they lay down strips of kevlar,

104
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,858
a strong, heat-resistant material.    

105
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,927
then they apply epoxy resin to the kevlar fiber      

106
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,562
to reinforce it.        

107
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,267
they leave the epoxy to dry  

108
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,069
and the next day apply strips of carbon fiber     

109
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,672
to reinforce the fuselage.   

110
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,408
the direction in which workers lay down the fiber layers   

111
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,609
is key.            

112
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,279
in flight, gliders are subject to strong forces        

113
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,881
that can bend and twist the structure.    

114
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,384
they must be sturdy yet as light as possible.   

115
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,024
the glider's tail boom gets the same treatment,    

116
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,360
except where the antenna will go,            

117
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,963
as radio signals don't penetrate
the carbon fiber very well.  

118
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:16,100
workers apply a thin coat of white gel paint       

119
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,503
to the 30-foot wing mold.   

120
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,172
gliders are always white    

121
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,842
so they don't absorb the sun's rays and overheat.  

122
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,979
they roll a sheet of carbon fiber over the painted mold.  

123
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,516
then the entire assembly team 

124
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,718
skillfully applies an even coat of resin.     

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,852
they've got to be quick.    

126
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,823
the resin cures in just 30 minutes.      

127
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,195
they add a final layer of carbon fiber        

128
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,464
to strengthen a portion of the wing     

129
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,166
that's subject to strong wind currents.    

130
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,606
after laying a white fleece  
over the layers of carbon fiber,

131
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,409
they seal it between two sheets of plastic. 

132
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,477
a vacuum compresses the layers,

133
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,880
which draws excess resin to the surface  

134
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,016
where workers can remove it.  

135
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,019
the two wing parts are glued together       

136
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,820
using the same epoxy resin   

137
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,224
that bonds and seals the carbon fibers.       

138
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,961
mixing in some cotton flakes helps thicken the resin,    

139
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:20,031
which they apply to the main spar, the wing's backbone,   

140
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,035
then to the front, back, and center portions.      

141
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,518
using a crane, workers carefully
fit the two wing molds together.

142
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:48,926
the molds' weight forces out any excess glue.        

143
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,862
they tightly clamp the two molds together     

144
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,332
and leave them to harden overnight      

145
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,335
in an oven heated to 140 degrees fahrenheit.   

146
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,405
the next day, there's a loud pop       

147
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,942
when workers separate the two molds.         

148
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,080
they carry the completed wing structure,        

149
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,416
which weighs only 132 pounds, 

150
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,552
over to another area to trim the resin overflow   

151
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,922
and sand down the seams.    

152
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,093
using a diamond-tip cutter,  

153
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,963

then they make sure they can easily put it back together   

156
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,506
before going on to the paint shop where they reassemble it. 

157
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,574
workers scan the surface    

158
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,477
and mark the areas they will sand by hand.    

159
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,717
they mount the glider's fuselage
on a rotating stand      

160
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,653
so they can easily access the entire surface.      

161
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,123
they sand it and then polish it
to a mirror finish.      

162
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,328
as workers assemble the glider,
they inspect every system.   

163
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,862
they check the engine command 

164
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,930
that lowers the glider's launch propeller        

165
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:04,069
and retracts it into the fuselage.       

166
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,271
the landing gear must lower and retract smoothly      

167
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,875
out of the glider's undercarriage.         

168
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,979
now they reassemble the wings. 

169
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:25,289
they check the air brake located in the wing.      

170
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,160
and, finally, they install the canopy.

[ bells ringing ]       

182
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,539
hand bells have a long tradition
of making beautiful music,   

183
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,743
from church hymns to the music of beethoven.   

184
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,412
it all starts with a casting mold      

185
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:25,683
that a worker encloses in a two-part container, or flask.

186
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,487
he fills the bottom half of the
flask with special, coarse sand

187
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,757
that's ideal for making sand molds.     

188
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,626
he compacts the sand,     

189
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,030
and then he turns the metal flask over.     

190
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,233
he places guide rods onto the bell shapes      

191
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,170
and fills the top part of the flask with sand.    

192
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,644
he puts a ramming board on again,           

193
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:56,715
and he compacts the sand that 
fills the top part of the flask.

194
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,388
now he removes the guide rods. 

195
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,193
then he removes the top half of the flask   

196
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:12,263
and takes out the casting mold.

197
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,532
he reconnects the top of the flask      

198
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,535
and then frees it completely from the sand mold.      

199
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,342
a worker places bronze ingots into a crucible        

200
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,210
to melt them down.       

201
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,080
he places heat-sensitive material onto the sand mold,  

202
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,185
and then heavy weights to hold the mold together safely.   

203
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,958
when the melted bronze reaches about 2,200 degrees fahrenheit,

204
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,295
a worker guides the crucible over to the sand mold     

205
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,898
and pours the molten metal into the cavity of the mold.  

206
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,704
he stops pouring        

207
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,706
when he sees the heat-sensitive
material smoking.       

208
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,510
this indicates the mold cavity is filled.   

209
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,915
workers then use a vibrating bed
and small hammers       

210
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,818
to free the finished castings from the sand mold.      

211
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,792
rotoblasting cleans the dirty castings.   

212
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,196
a worker trims off the excess pieces        

213
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,633
that feed the molten metal into the bell cavity.     

214
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,806
he sands the sharp edges of the bell          

215
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,477
and then drills the center hole
for the assembly screw.    

216
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,548
the bell casting then goes on a lathe.

working with a stylus that follows a template of the bell,

219
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,622
removes the coarse casting surface        

220
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,024
and makes the bell shiny.   

221
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,628
this turning operation also shapes the bell      

222
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,096
to give it the right tone.   

223

another carbide cutting tool  

224
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,907
shapes the inside of the bell casting,      

225
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,910
giving it shine        
and the desired tuning, as well.

using a custom-made tracing device,        

227
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,389
a worker reproduces the outside
shape of the bell on paper.  

228
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,663
he then traces the inside of the bell casting      

229
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,199
until he completes an exact replica        

230
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,935
of the inside and the outside shape.     

231
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,338
and this must match a master template.

00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,348
he also puts a jeweler's finish
on the inside.         

234
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,217
then he tests the bell's sound quality    

235
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,420
using a stroboscopic tuner and the human ear.       

236
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:54,025
he re-sands the bell to make a slight tonal adjustment.   

237
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,893
then he tests it again     

238
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,764
to make sure it strikes the perfect musical note.   

239

a worker gives the bell that final polish,       

240

252
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,152
the first fire hoses of the 1600s were made of leather.

253
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,088
but these hoses were heavy, would crack when dry,

00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,947
so they soak it in a plastic polymer solution 

274

with dye for color.      

275

a form of plastic, with white colorant and adhesive pellets. 

279

this mixture is for making the waterproof tubing     

280

this tubing will bond to the hose-jacket fabric.   

283

00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,115
which melts the mixture    
and forms it into a hollow tube.

285
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,518
the tube then passes through a basin of cool water

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,920
to set the plastic.      

287

next, the tube goes to the inspection table

to assemble the fire hose,   

291
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,200
they first pull out an outer hose jacket      

292
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,103
over a 33-yard-long cable.

00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,147
then with another cable,    

294
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,749
they feed a second untreated hose jacket     

295
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,386
inside the first one.     

296
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,966
finally, they attach a cable to
the third and innermost layer, 

297

00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,390
they begin the fusing process 

304
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,859
by clamping one end of the assembled hose     

305
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,263
to a steam nozzle.       

306
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,932
as the clamp holds the hose steady,     

307
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:58,336
the nozzle blasts       
pressurized steam into the tube.

308
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,406
at the same time, it moves   
backward, pulling out any kinks.

309
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,476
the hot steam melts the adhesive
in the tube material,     

310
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,045
and it penetrates the inner jacket around it.  

311
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,951
once everything's perfectly straight,      

312
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,287
they pump in cold air to solidify the adhesive.   

313
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,991
this permanently bonds the layers.          

314
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,498
they roll up the finished hose into a coil,          

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,301
controlling the winder with a foot pedal.       

316
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,837
then they lay the coiled hose on a table           

317
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,306
to install the couplings.   

318
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,708
those are the components that attach the hose      

319
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,510
to the water supply on one end 

320
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,579
and to the spray nozzle on the other.         

321
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:45,115
they trim each end and then insert a brass expansion ring 

322
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:49,520
and then an aluminum coupling on top.            

323
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,022
an expansion machine does the rest.         

324
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,726
they attack the end securely  
to the machine's protruding bar.

325
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,462
then the bar retracts and expands,     

326
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,731
pushing the brass ring outward.

327
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,533
the force wedges the brass   

328
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,337
into the aluminum coupling permanently.          

329
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:10,608
this company tests every fire house it produces  

330
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,078
under high pressure on this table.         

331
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,214
after marking the type of hose with a stencil         

332
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,550
in indelible ink, they fill the hose with water. 

333
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,819
they check for holes and kinks 

334
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,157
and verify that the couplings stay in place.  

335
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,026
after the test, they drain the water.     

336
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,028
they insert a giant sponge   

337
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,697
to get rid of any water left behind.          

338
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:38,102
and now these new hoses are  
ready for their baptism by fire.
