00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,787
narrator: fishing reels    
date back to 12th-century china.

4
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,724
in the beginning, they were very basic devices  

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,327
used only for storing extra line.    

6
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,797
but by the 1800s,       
craftsmen in britain and america

7
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,667
reinvented the reel when they gave it a drag system

8
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:09,869
for landing feisty fish.    

9
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,544
these flycasters could hook the big one at any moment,   

10
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,214
and that's when a precision  
fishing reel will come in handy.

11
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,951
to make a fly-fishing reel,  

12
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,955
they start with a solid aluminum puck.  

13
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:33,291
the puck turns on a lathe as a computerized cutter    

14
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,361
contours it to shape it into a spool.         

15
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,466
a different tool machines a center hole.    

16
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,638
the focus then moves to the other side       

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,907
as another tool completes the spool shape.   

18
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,576
the dimensions must be exact  

19
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,846
if this fishing reel is to perform flawlessly.   

20
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,852
they drill holes to both reduce the weight of the spool 

21
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:03,588
and provide some ventilation for wet fishing line.     

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,725
they cut windows into the other side      

23
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:10,128
for an attractive look that further lightens the reel.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,133
next, another aluminum puck is transformed into a frame  

25
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,335
for the spool and other parts. 

26
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:20,539
the frame goes into a bath of 
soapy water and plastic pellets,

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,208
which rub the part clean.   

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,614
the final touch is a black oxide finish.    

29
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,684
they now transform this aluminum bar into feet,  

30
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:35,688
which will be used to mount the reel to the fishing rod.  

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,092
a laser engraves the company name onto these attachments.  

32
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,763
it also does a bit of custom engraving on the frame. 

33
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,636
a worker now inserts      
a bronze bushing into the center

34
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:56,008
of the spool and uses hydraulic force to entrench it.

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,448
he then positions a stainless-steel ball     

36
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,182
on top of the bushing.     

37
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,586
he activates a press that drives the ball through it

38
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,589
to expand the bushing to the correct internal dimension.

39
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,863
another worker applies a counterweight    

40
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,732
to one side of the spool.   

41
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:20,999
this bit of stainless steel  

42
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,035
will offset the weight of the spool handle.      

43
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:29,007
she installs the spool's magnetic locking mechanism.  

44
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,978
this molded polymer part has a tiny magnet inside.   

45
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,950
she applies a second magnet to it,     

46
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,453
followed by a release button. 

47
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,092
one final magnet and an aluminum cap,      

48
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,226
and this assembly is complete. 

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,698
she now installs part of the drag-engagement system. 

50
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,034
it's this system that will create the necessary resistance

51
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:58,204
on the fishing line for battling a big fish.    

52
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:07,713
she applies adhesive to screws 

53
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,451
and then uses them to attach the
footing to the fly-reel frame, 

54
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:16,188
using a screwdriver to set it to a specific torque.     

55
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,924
she then resumes the assembly of the drag system

56
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:23,262
by placing a rubber "o" ring in the frame's center groove. 

57
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,197
she installs the thrust-bearing ring,    

58
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,333
which can be rotated by the fly-fisher       

59
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,735
to adjust the drag setting.  

60
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:46,352
and it's now time to attach the 
spool to the fishing-reel frame.

61
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,820
she turns it to check the drag setting        

62
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,590
and adjusts it to its starting point.     

63
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,095
she secures the setting    

64
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,798
by inserting a pin into the bearing.        

65
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,573
then she removes the center locking screw temporarily   

66
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,010
to assemble the knob base to the thrust bearing.     

67
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,250
she reinstalls the screw    

68
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,086
and covers the assembly with the drag knob.      

69
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,759
she turns the spool for a final inspection,    

70
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,597
confirming that this fishing reel operates smoothly.    

71
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,402
and now it's ready to put a positive spin     

72
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:39,071
on any fishing experience.   

73
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,089
narrator: a fresh coat of latex paint  

74
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,758
is a surefire way to spruce up a home.      

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,495
latex is a term for acrylic or vinyl resins.  

76
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,097
latex paint is water-based,  

77
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,233
so it has less odor than alkali paint.       

78
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,970
it also cleans up without any harsh solvents.  

79
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,606
all you need is soap and water.

80
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,512
the paint factory produces an uncolored base.  

81
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,247
the store then tints that base 

82
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,385
to the color ordered by the customer.    

83
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:31,056
latex paint contains water, latex for adhesion,      

84
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,593
titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate,       

85
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:38,129
potassium, zinc for mildew resistance,  

86
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,531
and whatever additives     

87
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,200
the particular type of paint requires.    

88
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,603
for example, if it's paint designed for metal,      

89
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,472
a rust inhibitor.       

90
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,879
they pump the water into a large mixing tank.   

91
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,949
then they add a thickening agent
and stabilizer         

92
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:58,017
to prevent the ingredients   

93
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,885
from settling to the bottom of the tank   

94
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:04,490
and to the bottom of the can once the paint is packaged.   

95
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,359
a vacuum duct sucks up the waste.      

96
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,430
one at a time,         

97
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,501
all the ingredients except the latex go in.    

98
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:18,904
there's a specific mixing time after each ingredient     

99
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,541
because proper blending is critical for quality.    

100
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,645
now they pump the tank's contents      

101
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,015
into another mixing tank that contains the latex.    

102
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,720
after four to six hours of blending,          

103
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:39,791
the industrial-sized batch of paint base is finally ready.

104
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,527
the factory subjects a sample from every batch   

105
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,597
to extensive quality-control testing.    

106
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,703
this viscometer measures the thickness of the paint.  

107
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,408
this test assesses how well the dry ingredients  

108
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,810
have dispersed within the mix. 

109
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,947
this tells them whether the mix is blended well enough 

110
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,651
to move into the second tank containing the latex.     

111
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,421
technicians also conduct color tests,   

112
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,958
adding recipes of liquid colorants to a gallon sample. 

113
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,759
this is to ensure the shade  

114
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,730
comes out exactly the way it's supposed to.   

115
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:25,437
to check if the paint covers well,   

116
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,506
they brush it onto test paper. 

117
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,309
the stripes provide a contrast 

118
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,110
so that any defects in the paint,         

119
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:36,048
such as foam or grit, will show.

120
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,484
this test evaluates tint strength.         

121
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,657
once the paint sample dries,  

122
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,392
they analyze its color properties      

123
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,496
with a machine called a spectrophotometer.  

124
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,067
once the batch passes inspection,       

125
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,402
it proceeds to packaging.   

126
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:01,807
latex paint contains about   
60% water, which corrodes metal,

127
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,211
so the steel cans are lined with an anti-rust coating.   

128
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:12,951
the cans run over a glue applicator,       

129
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,285
then over a label,       

130
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,221
which instantly sticks to the adhesive.    

131
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,968
the next stop is a filling machine.     

132
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,503
each can sits on a scale    

133
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,773
that's positioned under a dispensing nozzle.   

134
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,975
once the scale detects the correct net weight,    

135
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,510
it triggers the nozzle to stop.

136
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,986
from the filling machine to a lid dispenser       

137
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,456
that drops a cover onto each can.         

138
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,132
then it's on to what's called a lid press.   

139
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,602
as each can passes underneath, 

140
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:07,439
a row of cylinders gradually presses in the lid. 

141
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,945
the next machine, called a baler,        

142
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,081
attaches a curved handle made of steel wire.      

143
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,218
it locks the handle ends    

144
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,522
into metal disks on both sides of the can.   

145
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,496
the factory varies its formulations        

146
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:35,367
to produce paint in lusters ranging from flat to high gloss

147
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,303
and for interior and exterior use,       

148
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,608
making sure it's got every possible application covered. 

149
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,992
narrator: looms for handweaving cloth  

150
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,861
have become increasingly sophisticated over time.    

151
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,132
but the basic concept still remains the same --   

152
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,335
weaving horizontal threads, called weft threads,      

153
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,204
through vertical threads, called warp threads,      

154
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,141
to create the patterns in the cloth.         

155
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,748
the loom lifts selected warp threads.     

156
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,218
the weaver passes the weft   
thread between the warp threads,

157
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,556
then uses a beater to pack the weft tightly.   

158
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,226
they construct the loom's frame out of ash,  

159
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,762
which is strong enough to withstand the pulling    

160
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,864
of up to thousands of threads. 

161
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,437
workers submerge the frame pieces in mineral oil

162
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,841
to prevent the wood from drying out.        

163
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,044
they assemble the frame pieces with heavy-duty nuts and bolts,

164
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,314
then mount high-strength plastic brackets        

165
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,450
for attaching the various components,    

166
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,985
such as the cloth beam     

167
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,654
that grabs and moves the finished cloth.       

168
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:08,393
they wrap sandpaper around the beam's adhesive surface  

169
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,496
to grab the cloth without damaging it.      

170
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,603
elsewhere, workers make the loom's cables 

171
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,006
out of high-strength stainless steel.        

172
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,675
these cables maneuver harnesses that lift      

173
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,276
and lower the warp threads.  

174
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,212
after cutting each cable to length,     

175
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,149
she forms a loop through a cable crimp.     

176
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:35,520
then she locks the loop with this heavy-duty crimping tool. 

177
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,227
on one of the frame pieces, they mount a metal plate    

178
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,296
bearing the loom's model and serial numbers.      

179
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,834
they assemble the pulley system 
on which the harness cables run.

180
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:52,838
they thread the plastic pulleys
onto a steel axle       

181
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,676
and position the axle with   
steel disks called stop collars.

182
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,384
a spring lever helps each harness       

183
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:08,320
lift its respective warp thread.

184
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,189
after hammering a pin into each lever,        

185
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,726
they hook a wire to the pin,  

186
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,963
then squeeze the wire closed so that it can't unhook.    

187
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:25,403
they attach a chain to an eyelet
on one side of the spring lever.

188
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,806
shortening or lengthening this chain   

189
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,208
adjusts the tension of the harness.        

190
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,413
like the pulleys, the spring levers       

191
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,917
go onto an axle across the loom's frame.    

192
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,622
another loom component, called the warp beam,     

193
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,960
has holes which hold metal hoops
that guide the warp threads.  

194
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,163
a brake drum on the side    

195
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:55,367
provides counterforce to keep the threads taut.   

196
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,101
at the front of the loom,   

197
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,571
they install foot pedals called treadles.        

198
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:03,775
the weaver uses them to lift and lower the warp threads.   

199
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,777
next comes the beater,     

200
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,981
which the weaver uses to pack 
the weft thread into the fabric.

201
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:14,986
the pulley system for the harness cables goes on top.

202
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,523
this computer-controlled device,
called a dobby head,      

203
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,258
lifts and lowers the warp threads        

204
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,461
according to the programmed weaving pattern.        

205
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,932
each harness cable hooks onto the dobby head,   

206
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,134
goes around one of the pulleys,

207
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:32,337
and attaches to a hook on the harness.   

208
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,079
the factory checks every dobby head on a test loom

209
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,549
to ensure the device outputs the
programmed patterns correctly. 

210
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,626
next, workers install the spring levers   

211
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,963
that help the harness lift the warp threads.     

212
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:01,833
each lever hooks onto a spring,
which attaches to a chain,   

213
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,636
which connects to a harness.  

214
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:13,177
they install the warp beam at the back of the loom.    

215
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,847
the weaver installs the hoops and warp threads        

216
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,181
on the warp beam.       

217
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,784
as the loom weaves,      

218
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:22,520
the cloth beam gently moves the emerging fabric forward.  

219
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,922
the weft thread        

220
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:27,058
is wrapped around a bobbin called a shuttle.       

221
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,595
this pattern requires a two-weft-thread technique  

222
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,997
that uses a second shuttle   

223
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,166
suspended in front of the weaver.    

224
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,470
the loom keeps the threads evenly taut,          

225
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,407
producing a consistent and uniform weave --      

226
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:46,411
the hallmarks of a beautiful, quality cloth.         

227
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,695
narrator: until the mid-19th century,  

228
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,163
mother nature was the only producer of ice, 

229
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,634
and the idea of man-made ice seemed preposterous.      

230
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,236
it was a florida doctor who,  

231
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,438
in need of ice to cool feverish patients,       

232
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,173
invented the ice machine.   

233
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,909
the technology took a few years to refine,  

234
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,579
and then they were ready to chill.   

235
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,585
today's commercial ice makers churn out ice on demand,    

236
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:29,587
allowing restaurants and other businesses      

237
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,924
to keep things cool at all times.         

238
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:37,195
to make one, machinery folds the
edges of stainless-steel sheets 

239
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,597
so they can be assembled into the icemaker frame     

240
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,933
and exterior panels.      

241
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,472
meanwhile, copper uncoils over a roller, 

242
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,875
which removes the curl from the metal...       

243
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:55,080
a machine spiked with blades then punches the copper.    

244
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:59,217
in one action, it cuts numerous slits in the strip  

245
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,220
and slices it to the correct length.     

246
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:09,361
the notched strips are now ready
to be assembled into a grid.  

247
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:13,765
this grid is part of the evaporator.       

248
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,636
it's here the liquid refrigerant
will evaporate         

249
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:21,573
as it pulls heat from the water
to freeze it into ice cubes.  

250
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:30,048
this copper tubing is central to that process.  

251
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,583
an automated arm bends it   

252
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,853
into a configuration called the serpentine,     

253
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,589
producing a coil that will fit 
on the back with the evaporator.

254
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,259
as liquid refrigerant moves through it,       

255
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,396
it will draw heat out of the water.       

256
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,866
this machine flattens the tubing,      

257
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:51,068
giving it greater surface contact with the evaporator  

258
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,872
to facilitate heat transfer.  

259
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,743
then it's into a big washing machine     

260
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,547
to remove any oils or oxides on the parts.    

261
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,686
a worker now applies strips of tin silver solder      

262
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:10,422
to the evaporator's back plate.

263
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,559
this acid solution will act as a bonding agent.  

264
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,495
he then places the evaporator, solder side down,       

265
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,499
on the serpentine tubing and locks the assembled parts 

266
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,968
in an iron rig.        

267
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,843
he hoists the rig into an oven to melt the solder strips   

268
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,445
between the back plate and tubing,          

269
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,047
fusing the parts together.   

270
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,586
then it's into an ultrasonic bath,      

271
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,855
where high-frequency sound waves

272
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:47,058
clean off lingering contaminants.    

273
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,462
an inspector now examines the evaporator    

274
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,999
to confirm that the parts have been solidly fused.    

275
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,269
next, he installs pipes on an icemaker's side panel.  

276
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:03,207
these are the lines that supply
refrigerant to the machine.  

277
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,945
he turns the assembly around and removes the caps      

278
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:11,683
on the compressor to connect it
to a network of pipes.     

279
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,886
the compressor will force refrigerant through these pipes

280
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,755
in a continuous cycle of heating and cooling     

281
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,557
to eventually produce ice.   

282
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:28,500
he brazes the joints to seal the connections.    

283
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,640
he attaches a fan to another side panel.     

284
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:39,711
it will blow cool air onto the 
radiator to cool the refrigerant

285
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,580
and help convert it back into a liquid.      

286
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,253
now he pumps the refrigerant into the system and measures  

287
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:52,457
the flow to ensure it receives a precise amount. 

288
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,394
meanwhile, at another station, they assemble the ice bin.   

289
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,067
it's time to test this icemaker.

290
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,669
water flows continuously    

291
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,205
over the surface of the evaporator grid     

292
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,209
as the temperature inside the cells drops below freezing.

293
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,419
impurities, like minerals, are washed away        

294
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,421
as the water turns to ice,   

295
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,091
and the result is crystal-clear cubes,    

296
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:31,096
almost 6 1/2 pounds in just 15 minutes.      

297
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,940
finally, they install the front panel on the unit.  

298
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,444
this job is done,       

299
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:49,114
and it's time for a little liquid refreshment... 

300
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,516
on ice, of course.
