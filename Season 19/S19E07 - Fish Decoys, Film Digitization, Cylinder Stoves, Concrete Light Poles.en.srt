2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,907
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,387
   narrator: when luring fish   
   to a hole in a frozen lake,  

4
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,324
        it helps to take        
       a crafty approach.       

5
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,726
       it's a handcrafted       
       piece of folk art,       

6
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,995
          and it's also         
    a cunning piece of work.    

7
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,197
     often brightly colored     
       with bold patterns,      

8
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,399
       the decoy attracts       
    the attention of fish --    

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,504
          an attraction         
  that will likely prove fatal. 

10
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,208
     native north americans     

11
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,677
  were the first to use decoys  
  to catch fish in the winter.  

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,214
        european settlers       
     followed their example.    

13
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,549
      and centuries later,      

14
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,153
     decoy artists carry on     
   this tradition of trickery.  

15
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,487
        at this workshop,       

16
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,691
        the decoy starts        
  with a plank of white cedar.  

17
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:35,761
 it's a wood with dense fibers, 
  so it won't expand when wet.  

18
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,297
   he draws a basic fish shape  
     on the wood freestyle.     

19
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,301
            this one            
    is to resemble a herring.   

20
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,371
     he carves out the shape    
        with a band saw,        

21
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,106
      producing the blank,      

22
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,509
  which can now be transformed  
       into a fish decoy.       

23
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:58,484
      he cuts a narrow slot     
 for attaching a metal tail fin.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,758
     he draws a center line     
     around the decoy blank.    

25
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,128
this serves as a reference point

26
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,465
   as he now tapers the edges   
       with a sharp knife.      

27
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:16,869
      if he cuts too deep,      
   he could spoil the carving,  

28
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,604
    so he whittles carefully,   

29
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:22,508
   removing just a bit of wood  
 with each stroke of the knife. 

30
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,345
            the goal            
   is to round the sharp edges  

31
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,680
     and soften the profile     

32
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:31,117
    without cutting too deep    
      and gouging the wood.     

33
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,154
   he sands the entire surface  
          of the decoy          

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,355
  until it's perfectly smooth.  

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,626
      sanding also opens up     
      the pores of the wood     

36
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,461
      so paint will adhere.     

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,300
        he carves a mouth       

38
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,904
       and then cuts slits      
   for two sets of side fins.   

39
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,576
      using a power carver,     
   he now bores into the wood   

40
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:01,380
   to create fish eye sockets   
         on both sides.         

41
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,519
    he takes an equal amount    
  of two epoxy clay components  

42
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,987
  and kneads the two together.  

43
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,590
 this activates the ingredients,

44
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,893
         turning it into        
     a putty-like adhesive.     

45
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:18,931
 he presses some of the adhesive

46
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,134
            into each           
   of the decoy's eye sockets.  

47
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,809
    he presses the glass eyes   
 into the epoxy-filled sockets. 

48
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,218
   next he cuts six fish fins   
   from a sheet of aluminum,    

49
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,554
    creating one dorsal fin,    
     two sets of side fins,     

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,857
      and a large tail fin.     

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,296
       he inserts the fins      
   into slots in the carving.   

52
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:53,398
      he then drills holes      
    in the wood on each side.   

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,102
        he presses nails        
 into those holes using pliers. 

54
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,672
   this secures the tail fin.   

55
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,509
       the fins on decoys       
  are larger than on live fish  

56
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,114
   to enable them to swim well  
         when weighted.         

57
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:10,783
     he now carves a pocket     
       for the lead weight      

58
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,952
       in the decoy belly.      

59
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,589
 he inserts the front side fins,

60
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:20,593
 so that they protrude slightly 
 into the freshly carved pocket.

61
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:24,463
    he scoops up molten lead    
  and pours it into the pocket. 

62
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,264
     as the lead solidifies,    

63
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,268
      it weights the decoy      
        so it will sink,        

64
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,137
       and it also secures      
       the two side fins.       

65
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,272
  he applies epoxy to the lead, 

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,742
    sealing it so it won't be   
      exposed to the water.     

67
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,746
    he coats the entire decoy   
          with lacquer.         

68
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,347
       this seals the wood      
         against water,         

69
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,017
     which would have caused    
       the wood to swell,       

70
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,885
   cracking the final finish.   

71
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,887
     once the lacquer dries     

72
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,223
     and the paint has been     
     scraped off the eyes,      

73
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,093
       the decoy is ready       
       to take the plunge.      

74
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,294
           he tests it          
    to confirm that it sinks    

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,565
     and that it sits level     
     underwater and swims.      

76
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,367
           sometimes,           
  more lead needs to be added.  

77
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,039
   but in this case, the decoy  
    performs fine underwater.   

78
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,243
 he marks a spot for a screw eye
   for threading fishing line   

79
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:15,780
  and then twists the screw eye 
         into that spot.        

80
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,984
   he paints the herring decoy  
         a vibrant red,         

81
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,053
       a color that isn't       
    scientifically accurate,    

82
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,789
      but one that should       
      tantalize real fish.      

83
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,059
  decoys are often exact copies 
            of fish.            

84
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:30,195
   they're designed to simply   
     pique their curiosity.     

85
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,997
    since fish are attracted    

86
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,000
      by colors and shapes      
    they don't normally see,    

87
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,336
          decoy artists         
can be as creative as they like.

88
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,405
 considered a form of folk art, 

89
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,875
  fish decoys are often entered 
       into competitions.       

90
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:46,879
   but of course when it comes  
   to their underwater allure,  

91
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,547
  the real judges are the fish. 

92
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,298
     narrator: unless you're    
  actually in a movie theater,  

93
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,234
     you're likely watching     
  a digital version of a film.  

94
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,904
      a movie shot on film      
      has to be digitized       

95
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:14,840
       to be put on a disc      
 or to be downloaded and viewed 

96
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,575
    on an electronic device.    

97
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,044
          digitization          
    also preserves the movie    

98
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,882
 as film physically deteriorates
           over time.           

99
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,387
        a movie has to be       
       in a digital format      

100
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,390
  to be viewable from a dvd...

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,007
        this organization       
    has produced 13,000 films   

109
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,010
  since it was founded in 1939. 

110
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:56,215
   and now it's in the process  
  of digitizing the collection, 

111
00:06:56,217 --> 00:07:01,286
    as well as the 80 to 100    
new films it produces each year.

112
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,023
   once all the finished films  
         are digitized,         

113
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,558
          the next step         
 will be to digitize stock shots

114
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,327
      and archival footage.     

115
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,898
    the film board's archives   

116
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,368
       contain many films       
     which have deteriorated    

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,705
           due to age           
   and poor storage conditions  

118
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,374
    such as exposure to cold    
           or to heat,          

119
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,908
   both of which deform film,   

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,513
      and excess humidity,      
   which causes fungus growth.  

121
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:28,847
       film's other enemy?      

122
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,918
  a damaging chemical reaction  
     which occurs over time     

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,586
        between the acid        
       in the film plastic      

124
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,790
      and the colored dyes      
     that make up the image.    

125
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:43,595
   the first step is to repair  
     any breaks in the film     

126
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,899
     so technicians can view    
   and evaluate its condition.  

127
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:50,535
   they do this using a simple  
    device called a splicer.    

128
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,072
    they lay each broken end    
    into the splicer's track    

129
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,642
 and cut off the severed frame. 

130
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,219
  a missing frame here or there 
   isn't all that noticeable.   

131
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,621
      once the broken frame     
           is removed,          

132
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:13,492
they lay both ends in the track,
  centering the meeting point.  

133
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,367
    then they tape the splice   
         on both sides.         

134
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,304
 this tape is specially designed
       for film splicing.       

135
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:28,840
       its chemical makeup      
 won't damage the film over time

136
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,310
as would ordinary adhesive tape.

137
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:36,247
       the splicer punches      
   sprocket holes in the tape   

138
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,051
  so that the spliced portion,  
         like the rest,         

139
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,521
 will thread onto the sprockets 
     of the projector reel.     

140
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,860
    technicians evaluate all    
 existing versions of the film, 

141
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,795
       from the original,       

142
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,263
     to the screening prints    
  produced for movie theaters.  

143
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,600
           they assess          
     the general condition,     

144
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:58,270
   note where the splices are   
  and which frames are damaged, 

145
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:02,407
 then they decided which version
  is in the best shape overall. 

146
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,877
       that's the version       
         they digitize.         

147
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,479
    later, they'll digitally    
  edit out the damaged portions 

148
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,083
      and replace them with     
 identical but undamaged frames 

149
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,018
  digitized from another copy.  

150
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,686
    after threading the film    
      through the scanner,      

151
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,154
       they close the gate      

152
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,958
 to hold the film flat and close
     to the scanning camera.    

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,295
   then they input the picture  
     quality specifications     

154
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:24,596
        and start her up.       

155
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:31,170
    the scanner gently loops    
  the film around its spools... 

156
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,743
    ...and begins rolling it    
        past the camera.        

157
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,718
 for the picture quality they've
 selected for this digitization,

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,888
 the camera snaps three pictures
         of every frame.        

159
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,863
  the scanner's control station 

160
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,999
  displays what's being scanned 
          in real time,         

161
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,268
           along with           
  all the technical parameters. 

162
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,806
    this digitization process   
   itemizes every single frame  

163
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,542
 so when they digitally replace 
        a damaged portion       

164
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,811
      with an undamaged one     
        from another copy       

165
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,115
  they can match everything up  
      to the exact frames.      

166
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,220
         the final step         
      is color correction.      

167
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,156
   because the digitized film   
    is often pieced together    

168
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,892
       from more than one       
         film original,         

169
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,027
        there are usually       
        color variations.       

170
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,429
          for example,          
   the character's blue jacket  

171
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,498
             will be            
    a different shade of blue   

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,833
       at different times.      

173
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,503
 at this station, the technician
     manipulates the colors     

174
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,307
     to render them uniform     
      throughout the film.      

175
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,109
         it's essential         
    to resist the temptation    

176
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,843
    to overcorrect the image.   

177
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,512
           after all,           

178
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,849
    film has a very different   
  color and texture than video, 

179
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,519
  and even though the digitized 
film will play on video devices,

180
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,989
   it must remain artistically  
    and historically faithful   

181
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,391
      to the film original.     

182
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,459
     <i> do not remain seated.</i>     

183
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,761
  <i> i repeat -- a nuclear war...</i> 

184
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,943
   narrator: a cylinder stove   
     is designed for campers    

185
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,945
            who like            
    their creature comforts.    

186
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,282
       just pitch the tent      
  and set up the stove inside.  

187
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:26,351
 it keeps things warm and toasty
     for most of the night.     

188
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,288
  it also has a cooking surface 
     and a tank at the side     

189
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,225
      to provide hot water      
          for washing.          

190
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,499
    no need to huddle around    
    a campfire to stay warm.    

191
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,501
        a cylinder stove        
       can take the chill       

192
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,636
             out of             
   the wilderness experience.   

193
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,339
      the cylindrical shape     
   means it can take the heat.  

194
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:50,708
   it will expand and contract  
   with the temperature change  

195
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,979
       and still maintain       
      it's original shape.      

196
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,182
 the cylindrical firebox starts 
   with a flat sheet of steel.  

197
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,718
        a worker feeds it       
   through a roller repeatedly  

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,454
        until it reaches        
       the desired shape.       

199
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,327
    then a plasma cutter cuts   
  an opening for the stove door 

200
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,931
   in another sheet of steel,   
  following a pattern overhead. 

201
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,401
        the plasma cutter       
works by sending an electric arc

202
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,638
     through compressed air,    
 and the result is a clean cut. 

203
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,545
  he now places the stove body  
      on the door framework     

204
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,147
     and clamps the assembly    
        in a special jig        

205
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:33,819
    to secure it as he welds    
    the two parts together.     

206
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:37,222
         he then places         
 the backplate on the workbench 

207
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,359
   and positions the other end  
     of the cylinder on it.     

208
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,695
      he clamps them there      
    and welds them together.    

209
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,766
    using the plasma cutter,    

210
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,302
   he trims the front and back  
          of the stove.         

211
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,971
          the trimming          
     rounds the ends nicely.    

212
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,377
 from three flat sheets of steel
    to a cylindrical firebox,   

213
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,381
       the transformation       
 has taken less than 10 minutes.

214
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:05,584
    the welder now reinforces   
 the underside of the stove top 

215
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,653
       with several braces      
   arranged in a grid pattern.  

216
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,456
     this extensive bracing     
      will prevent warping      

217
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,858
      to keep the stove top     
         perfectly flat         

218
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,362
     under the intense heat     
     of the wood fire below.    

219
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,938
      this is the stove top     
    before and after bracing.   

220
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,341
      after cutting a hole      
       for the stovepipe,       

221
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:31,743
   he inserts a piece of pipe   
           temporarily          

222
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:35,514
so that he can correctly install
       a stovepipe collar.      

223
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,284
       once the collar is       
solidly attached to the cooktop,

224
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,421
    he removes the stovepipe.   

225
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,290
      he then bends the rim     
  of the collar in four places, 

226
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,959
          creating tabs         
      to keep the stovepipe     

227
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:52,230
 from sliding into the firebox. 

228
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,832
     he's now ready to join     

229
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,435
     the cylindrical firebox    
        to the stove top.       

230
00:13:56,437 --> 00:14:00,272
    he locks them in position   
 and welds the entire assembly. 

231
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,642
     this final welded seam     
         seals the stove        

232
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,712
         for an airtight        
     and long-lasting burn.     

233
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,785
 next he positions leg fittings 
    on the belly of the stove   

234
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:17,322
  using a sawhorse-style tool.  

235
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,458
   once he welds the fittings   
          to the stove,         

236
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,027
      he removes the tool.      

237
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,599
         then it's over         
to a computerized plasma cutter.

238
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:31,670
      it cuts damper holes      
       in the stove door.       

239
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,672
      damper holes are used     
   to regulate the flow of air  

240
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:34,773
          to the fire.          

241
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,679
they also install a baffle plate
  on the back of the stove door 

242
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,081
 to keep sparks from flying out 
         into the tent.         

243
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:49,487
  the worker attaches the door  
   to the stove with a hinge.   

244
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:55,227
     he tests it to confirm     
that it opens and closes easily.

245
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,963
  another worker now roles pipe 
        for the chimney,        

246
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,832
     using galvanized steel     
    because it doesn't rust.    

247
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,935
     he interlocks the seam     
        and flattens it.        

248
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,504
       he crimps the ends       

249
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:09,173
       to connect the pipe      
  to the other pieces of pipe.  

250
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,643
      there are five pieces     
      of stovepipe in all,      

251
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,846
and they can be stacked together
         for transport.         

252
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,315
   with the latch now attached  
       to the stove door,       

253
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:21,319
   he sprays black stove paint  
  onto the cylindrical firebox. 

254
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,856
          the paint job         
      will prevent rusting.     

255
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,992
        finally he rivets       
   a brass manufacturer's tag   

256
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,461
      onto the stove front.     

257
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,530
  now it's time to pack it up.  

258
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,000
from the grate to the water tank
        to the stovepipe,       

259
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:38,203
    everything can be stowed    
      inside the fire box,      

260
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,271
 making it completely portable. 

261
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:44,008
assembly in the tent should take
      about five minutes --     

262
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,745
           a small job          
    for a long-lasting burn.    

263
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,547
   the biggest cylinder stoves  

264
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,083
   are designed to hold a fire  
      for an entire night.      

265
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,351
   and with the proper setup,   

266
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,488
      campers should sleep      
         safe and sound.        

267
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,825
       installing a piece       
    of heat-resistant rubber    

268
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,294
        protects the tent       
      around the stovepipe.     

269
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,364
         then it's time         
  to hunker down for the night  

270
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,201
    and enjoy a little warmth   
       in the wilderness.       

271
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,453
     narrator: spun concrete    
     light poles tower above    

272
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,322
      our towns and cities,     
        lighting the way.       

273
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,058
        they're actually        
        hollow structures       

274
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,994
      with wiring or cable      
    snaked through the cores.   

275
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,064
       the concrete walls       
    are reinforced by steel.    

276
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,199
         yet these poles        
       are flexible enough      

277
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,935
      to bend with the wind     
         and snap back.         

278
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:50,207
   when it comes to lampposts,  
      the higher the light,     

279
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,677
           the greater          
      the area illuminated.     

280
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,814
    some concrete light poles   
  are over three stories high.  

281
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,016
    they start with a tenon,    

282
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,219
 the part of the pole framework 
 that anchors the light fixture.

283
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,888
    they place two in a mold    

284
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,958
     because they're making     
    two light poles at once.    

285
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,628
  a worker strings four thick,  
          steel strands         

286
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,030
  from one end of the long mold 
          to the other,         

287
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,231
         threading them         
       through the tenons       

288
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,900
    and through spiral wire.    

289
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,637
   this establishes the basic   
framework of the concrete poles.

290
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,040
         another worker         
       installs zinc boxes      

291
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,908
   for electrical connections.  

292
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,711
           he caps it           
   with a block of rigid foam   

293
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,914
          to protect it         
  when the concrete is poured.  

294
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,850
         the next worker        
      attaches a stress gun     

295
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,987
      to chucks that secure     
       the steel strands.       

296
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,189
    the gun pulls the strands   
           one by one           

297
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,058
     to a specific tension,     

298
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,994
        and they stretch        
       like rubber bands.       

299
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:46,464
        they'll be pulled       
       even tighter later.      

300
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:51,736
 every yard or so, he attaches  
 stay rings for extra rigidity. 

301
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,308
      he ties them in place     
    with plastic-coated wire.   

302
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,213
         another worker         
    stretches the spiral wire   

303
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,882
    around the steel strands    
           and tenons           

304
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,153
    to round out the skeleton   
       of the light poles.      

305
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,156
         the spiral wire        
     will also stop the pole    

306
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:15,426
     from twisting too much     
         in high winds.         

307
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,563
        a crane transfers       
     the long and hefty mold    

308
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:24,301
  over to the next station and  
 lowers it onto several stands. 

309
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,638
a hopper now swings into action,
       guided by workers.       

310
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,241
        it's a traveling        
       concrete dispenser.      

311
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,443
     as it moves on a track,    
           it funnels           

312
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,380
    specially mixed concrete    
         into the mold.         

313
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,515
          the concrete          
     has been made to order,    

314
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,719
  with the customer specifying  
      its color, strength,      

315
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:44,389
      and other qualities.      

316
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,459
      the concrete also has     
     a low moisture content.    

317
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,729
          this makes it         
     the consistency of clay    

318
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,331
     and therefore formable.    

319
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,199
  as the concrete is dispensed, 

320
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,737
     workers pack it around     
the light pole's steel skeleton.

321
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,874
         using trowels,         
     they scoop up overflow     

322
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,610
     and smooth the surface     
      of the wet concrete.      

323
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:09,214
    one worker then cleans up   
        the outer flanges       

324
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:12,016
           and applies          
      a nonstick substance.     

325
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,486
   a crane moves the top half   
   of the mold into position    

326
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,023
       and lowers it onto       
the concrete-filled bottom part.

327
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,694
  the team bolts the two parts  
  of the mold tightly together  

328
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,629
  using pneumatic impact tools. 

329
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,566
 they now pull the steel strands
     to their final tension,    

330
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,435
   stretching them so tightly   

331
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,838
 that they compress the concrete
        once it hardens.        

332
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,108
    concrete is much stronger   
   when it's being compressed.  

333
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,646
      the mold is now ready     
    for the spinning machine.   

334
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,648
        it's essentially        
   a series of railway wheels.  

335
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,984
         a crane lowers         
    the mold's running rings    

336
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,986
 into the grooves of the wheels,

337
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,389
     and then they crank up     
           the speed.           

338
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:55,660
  the wheels turn at 500 rpms,  
    and the centrifugal force   

339
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,463
 causes the concrete to migrate 
    to the wall of the mold.    

340
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:03,535
   the result is a hollow pole  
   with dense, concrete walls.  

341
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:07,605
     transferred to a kiln,     
    the concrete steam-cures    

342
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,708
           in the mold          
      for about five hours.     

343
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,545
    the concrete light poles    
  are ready for the big reveal. 

344
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:19,216
       they open the mold       
       and roll them out.       

345
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,353
  at this point, the two poles  
       are still attached.      

346
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,357
  they examine them for flaws,  
 and then they'll separate them.

347
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,561
        all they need now       
       is some buffing up.      

348
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:34,098
        here, they polish       
   a different octagonal pole   

349
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,067
     to expose the pigments     
        in the concrete.        

350
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,708
the different colored aggregates
  in this particular cement mix 

351
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,777
          give the pole         
     a mottled marble look.     

352
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:53,317
an i.d. tag has also been molded
         into the cement        

353
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,121
   with the manufacturing date  
 and the pole's height and mass.

354
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,859
     they test just how far     
        they can take it        

355
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:05,329
       to confirm the pole      
    meets industry standards.   

356
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,399
      they spray a special      
 acrylic finish onto some poles.

357
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,603
         graffiti can be        
   easily scrubbed off of it.   

358
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,407
    even though it only takes   
        about 5 1/2 hours       

359
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,210
         to manufacture         
     a concrete light pole,     

360
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,713
 it should shine for many years.

361
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,224
