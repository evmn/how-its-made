00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,673
      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,853
    narrator: in the digital    
             world,             
      like the real one,        

4
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,789
        it helps to have        
     extra storage space.       

5
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,058
 an external hard drive stores  
 data separate from a computer  

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,795
  to expand storage capacity.   

7
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,263
   it also preserves memory.    

8
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,066
        so in the event         
     that the computer drive    
            crashes,            

9
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,668
       all is not lost.         

10
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,672
         50 years ago,          

11
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,742
      external hard drives      
        were the size of        
         refrigerators.         

12
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,145
             today,             
they squeeze a lot more memory  

13
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:23,482
          into drives           
  the size of chocolate bars.   

14
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:27,620
   on the hard-drive assembly   
              line,             
 there's not a speck of dust.   

15
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:30,222
    an air-filtering system     
sucks particles out of the air  

16
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,558
          to keep them          
 from contaminating the drive   

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,295
and compromising its function.  

18
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,430
       production starts        
     with the motor base.       

19
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,367
      an employee installs      
     a voice-coil magnet.       

20
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,036
        it's one of two         
that will move the drive heads  

21
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,905
      to write information      
      on rotating disks.        

22
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,640
  they're called voice coils    

23
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:52,711
  because they operate on the   
        same principle as       
         loudspeakers.          

24
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,114
      next, a robot places      
  one of the hard-drive disks   

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,650
      in the motor base.        

26
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:03,255
 a camera snaps a photo to send 
information to guide the robot  

27
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,792
        so it positions         
       the disk exactly.        

28
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,261
      another robot places      
     a round, metal spacer      

29
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,796
 at the center of the disk --   

30
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:16,068
       again, relying on        
the camera's eye for guidance.  

31
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,105
     it sets a second disk      
     on top of the spacer.      

32
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:26,078
 this is a two-disk hard drive, 
 but a drive can have several,  

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,016
    depending on the amount     
      of storage needed.        

34
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,485
            a robot             
  locks the disks into place    

35
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,253
 with a stainless-steel clamp.  

36
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:43,162
         this next part         
      is a plastic ramp.        

37
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,964
      the ramp is a place       
 to park the disk-drive heads   

38
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,235
    when they're not engaged    
 in reading and writing data.   

39
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,509
        those tiny heads        
    have been preassembled      

40
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,377
  to one end of the head arm.   

41
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,114
   they attach the other end    
          of the arm            

42
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,782
    to the lower voice coil     
          in the base           

43
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,919
        and then situate        
   the second voice coil above  
              it.               

44
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,795
          to maintain           
  its squeaky-clean interior,   

45
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:19,664
        a robot inserts         
     a thin cotton filter.      

46
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,602
          this filter           
  will capture dust particles   

47
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:28,407
     in the event that some     
  infiltrate the hard drive.    

48
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,845
   a robot now places a metal   
              cover             
    on the other side of the    
             drive.             

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,756
   another robot then screws    
 the cover to the motor base.   

50
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,629
    with the inner workings     
         now encased,           

51
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,299
  the hard drive can be moved   
     out of the air-filtered    
            section             

52
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,234
        of the factory.         

53
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,304
       a worker collects        
   the hard-drive assemblies    

54
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:02,574
   and slots them into a tote   
              box.              

55
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,311
      once a circuit board      
        has been added,         

56
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:08,114
 they transfer the hard drives  
      to a test chamber.        

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,317
     behind the closed door     
        of the chamber,         

58
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,620
  a robot swings into action.   

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,525
     it plucks a hard drive     
       from the tote box        

60
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:23,796
 and plugs it into a test cell  
      to confirm that it's      
          functional.           

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,934
       outside, employees       
go about their daily business,  

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,070
    as the robot methodically   
             tests              

63
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:34,272
        each hard drive         
      in the tote boxes.        

64
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,278
     once a tote of drives      
       is confirmed to be       
          operational,          

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,013
    the chamber ejects them     

66
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,750
     and a worker then does     
   a visual inspection of each  
              one.              

67
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,619
    she looks for scratches     

68
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,489
        or other damage         
      that could hinder its     
           function.            

69
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,959
    there's another slightly    
 different system for testing.  

70
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,497
   in this one, the employee    
     places each drive on a     
            conveyor            

71
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,266
        that delivers it        
      to a robot tester.        

72
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:07,306
   having two tester systems    
ensures that if one goes down,  

73
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,376
  they still have another one   
         to carry on.           

74
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:15,247
    after all, like humans,     
  robots are not infallible.    

75
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,588
  at the packing station now,   

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,057
        there's one last        
      visual inspection.        

77
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,927
       the employee scans       
   the drive's serial number    

78
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:32,131
    so its production can be    
             traced             
    in the event of a problem   
             later.             

79
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:36,135
 she then seals it in plastic.  

80
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,804
        this hard drive         
  is now ready to accept data   

81
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,674
    and ensure that someone     
    doesn't totally lose it     

82
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,743
     if their computer drive    
            crashes.            

83
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,829
   narrator: people have been   
       noshing on shrimp        

84
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,497
 since the beginning of time,   

85
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,166
   but it hasn't always been    
        an easy catch.          

86
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,836
          wild stocks           
 declined in the 20th century.  

87
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:14,105
      shrimp farms emerged      
      to supply what nature     
           couldn't.            

88
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,840
factories process the harvest,  

89
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,377
     ensuring an abundance      
    of ready-to-eat shrimp      

90
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,246
       for the freezer.         

91
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,786
   jumbo shrimp have long been  
               big              
   on the cocktail circuit.     

92
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,389
    today, it comes prepped     
          and frozen,           

93
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,123
 complete with cocktail sauce.  

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,192
     just unwrap and thaw.      

95
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,262
     shrimp cocktail is one     
    of the many ready-to-eat    
             dishes             

96
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,131
    prepared at this factory    
         in thailand.           

97
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,534
     fresh from the farm,       

98
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,270
      the shrimp undergoes      
   a quick cold-water rinse.    

99
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,605
         it then rides          
    a perforated conveyor.      

100
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,609
   rinse water drains through   
   the holes in the conveyor    

101
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:54,546
       to keep the shrimp       
     from becoming soggy.       

102
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,950
 still cool from the icy bath,  
     the curly crustaceans      

103
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:01,520
     spill off the conveyor     
     into plastic baskets.      

104
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,290
    they weigh each basket      

105
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,626
  and then transfer the shrimp  
       to a larger tub.         

106
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,964
     to keep the chill on,      

107
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,300
      they add crushed ice      
        between loads.          

108
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,970
        a temperature of        
 50 degrees fahrenheit or less  

109
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,505
       must be maintained       
    throughout processing,      

110
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,608
    or quality will suffer.     

111
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,715
     it's now time for the      
 inevitable -- the deheading.   

112
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,651
       using a metal tool       
 that's like an open thimble,   

113
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,587
 workers pull the heads off the 
 shrimp with a few quick tugs.  

114
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:44,063
       the deheading line       
    is a long and busy one.     

115
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,535
      the headless shrimp       
 now travel to sizing rollers.  

116
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,805
 the space between the rollers  
      is narrow at first        

117
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,974
    and wider further down.     

118
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,677
  as the rollers spin, smaller  
  shrimp fall through first,    

119
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,816
  and the larger ones continue  
               on               
 to fall through further down.  

120
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,419
  they accumulate in different  
   piles on conveyors below.    

121
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,689
   this separates the shrimp    
  into five size categories.    

122
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,024
      out of the sorter,        

123
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,093
      an employee samples       
   the shrimp's temperature     

124
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:17,629
   to confirm that it remains   
      adequately chilled.       

125
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,835
 deheaded and sorted by size,   

126
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,905
   these shrimp are now ready   
 to come out of their shells.   

127
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,506
     on the shelling line,      

128
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,576
 some workers cut the tails off 
   and others leave them on,    

129
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,846
    because there's a market    
           for both.            

130
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,048
    after they peel away the    
             shell,             

131
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,518
   they cut out the digestive   
              tract             
   that runs along the back.    

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,522
 it's often referred to as the  
   vein because it looks like   
              one.              

133
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:48,193
   workers on this line peel    
and devein 800 shrimp an hour.  

134
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,930
      the shrimp then goes      
   to different prep zones.     

135
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,332
         at this one,           

136
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,201
    an employee dips tail-on    
             shrimp             
      into an egg mixture       

137
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,404
     and then dredges them      
        in rice flour.          

138
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,442
  he sends them down the line   
      to the next worker.       

139
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,081
  he rolls the floured shrimp   
        in rice paper.          

140
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:15,087
        as you can see,         
    there's a bit of trick to   
             this.              

141
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:22,761
    he moistens the edges of    
   the rice paper to seal the   
             wrap.              

142
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,764
  the result is a spring-roll   
 appetizer that can be frozen   

143
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,134
        until it's ready        
   to be cooked and served.     

144
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,373
   in another area, a worker    
 prepares a breaded recipe --   

145
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:38,243
      again, using shrimp       
    with the tail still on.     

146
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,845
      this is finger food       

147
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,715
   and, with the tails on the   
    shrimp, will be easier to   
             grip.              

148
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:48,787
   he soaks it in seasonings    
 and coats it in breadcrumbs.   

149
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,324
 then he dips it in egg batter  
     and breads it again.       

150
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,126
 the second coating of crumbs   

151
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,729
      will give the shrimp      
   extra crunch when fried.     

152
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,266
   the tray is now full, and    
 so it's over to the fry belt.  

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,871
       after a quick trip       
       through hot oil,         

154
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,007
       the breaded shrimp       
      is perfectly fried.       

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,347
        all the shrimp,         
  including this raw product,   

156
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,484
      take a blustery ride      
      through a freezer.        

157
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:21,086
         spread evenly          
     across the conveyor,       

158
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,889
    they freeze individually    
     rather than in big, icy    
            clumps.             

159
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,026
  so you don't have to thaw a   
    whole bunch to get a few    
            shrimp.             

160
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:32,698
       the frozen shrimp        
  falls into weigh stations.    

161
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,831
    at the correct amount,      

162
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,168
        the bottom opens        
       to release them.         

163
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,771
 an ice glaze will protect them 
      from freezer burn.        

164
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:44,108
  these frozen-shrimp products  
     are ready to leave the     
            factory.            

165
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,779
  from the freezer to the oven  
      to your taste buds.       

166
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,115
     with all the prep work     
     done at the factory,       

167
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:54,453
  these frozen-shrimp products  
      are quite a treat.        

168
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,941
      narrator: rice is an      
   integral part of the asian   
             diet,              

169
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:19,344
 so it's not surprising to find 
   special storage vessels for  
              it.               

170
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,148
  in thailand, the traditional  
  container is a rice box --    

171
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,684
         a covered jar          
     handwoven from bamboo      

172
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,352
      and often beautifully     
           decorated.           

173
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,856
     they're also produced      
     as decorative items for    
            export.             

174
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,562
 thai rice boxes started out as 
      an ordinary household     
           container            

175
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,431
   for cooked, sticky rice.     

176
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,166
         today, they're         
   sought-after handicrafts,    

177
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,437
  produced in a range of sizes  
   for storage of all kinds     

178
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,572
   or simply for decoration.    

179
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,575
    each box is handcrafted     
     from start to finish.      

180
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,046
       the artisan begins       
  with thin strips of bamboo.   

181
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,848
      he splits the strips      
      with his fingernail       

182
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,919
     to make them the width     
            required            
for the box size he's weaving.  

183
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,389
    he lines up the first few   
             strips             
         on the floor           

184
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,457
     and holds them steady      
         with his foot          

185
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,260
 as he weaves strips crosswise  
         through them           

186
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,663
        in an under-one,        
      over-two sequence.        

187
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,536
      he continues weaving      
         this pattern           

188
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,206
       until he produces        
 a square that's large enough   

189
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,542
 to form the base of the box.   

190
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,214
 he sprays the base with water  
   to soften up the bamboo.     

191
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,283
    this prevents the strips    
         from breaking          

192
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,084
 when he now bends them upward  

193
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,454
        to begin weaving        
     the sides of the box.      

194
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,694
once he's completed the sides,  

195
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,896
       he begins weaving        
        the box's neck,         

196
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,367
  pulling the strips laterally  
   in a circular direction.     

197
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:52,104
   he alternates, folding one   
              strip             
  upward, one strip downward.   

198
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,775
 he trims the downward strips,  

199
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:01,380
     then inserts the ends      
   through the woven sides.     

200
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,052
    next, pulling the strips    
      through the middle,       

201
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:10,388
     he fits a bamboo ring      
 over the outside of the neck,  

202
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,724
       then another along       
    the inside of the neck,     

203
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:17,596
     locking the remaining      
   upward strips in between.    

204
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:19,531
 this immobilizes the strips,   

205
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,734
      eliminating any need      
      for nails or glue.        

206
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,669
    it also adds rigidity,      

207
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,472
          reinforcing           
    the neck's round shape.     

208
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,079
          a quick trim          
   of the remaining strips,     

209
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,149
          and the box           
     is fully constructed.      

210
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,753
      he then makes a lid       

211
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:45,123
    using the same materials    
        and technique.          

212
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,294
      next, artisans coat       
the outside of the box and lid  

213
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,998
         with a mixture         
 of chalk, glue, and sawdust.   

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,834
    they let the coating dry    
 in the sun for a day or two,   

215
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,105
   until the surface becomes    
  hard and smooth like clay.    

216
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,177
  now an artist gets to work,   

217
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,048
 first applying two base coats  
       of acrylic paint.        

218
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,189
 once the base coats are dry,   

219
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,724
       she places the box       
        on a turntable          

220
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,161
       and applies a coat       
   of the background color.     

221
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,641
        once that dries,        
    she begins outlining the    
            design.             

222
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,051
 then she fills in the design.  

223
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,493
        once that's dry,        
       the fine details.        

224
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,663
     it's here that you see     
     the artistry emerge.       

225
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,642
  once the artwork has dried,   

226
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:13,845
     they encircle the neck     
    with a band of rattan,      

227
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,482
  then with strips of rattan,   
tie the box to a wooden stand.  

228
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,592
  at the base of each corner,   

229
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,062
  they weave the rattan strips  
  into a decorative pattern.    

230
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,544
   not only is this rice box    
     entirely handmade...       

231
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,278
          the artisans          
     never use templates,       

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,813
   never take measurements.     

233
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,682
    they do it all by eye.      

234
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,355
     the inside of the box      
         remains bare.          

235
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:02,294
 the idea is to see the bamboo  
and how skillfully it's woven.  

236
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,362
        it's a natural,         
       nontoxic surface,        

237
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:08,033
    against which it's safe     
        to store rice.          

238
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,850
     narrator: paper towels     
   were invented in the u.s.    

239
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,118
         in the 1920s.          

240
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,988
     the idea of a one-use,     
    disposable paper cloth      

241
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,657
    for cleaning and drying     
        proved popular.         

242
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,994
   and by 1931, paper towels    
   were being mass-marketed.    

243
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,664
   today, a paper towel roll    
     is such a staple in the    
            kitchen             

244
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,667
  that an attractive holder for 
               it               
          is a must.            

245
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,004
         a paper towel          
     always comes in handy      

246
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,540
      to soak up a spill,       
       clean a surface,         

247
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,408
   or simply dry wet hands.     

248
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,344
      the embossed pattern      
   is not just decoration --    

249
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,548
       it actually makes        
the paper towel more absorbent  

250
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,284
 by creating liquid-suctioning  
         empty spaces           

251
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,554
     in between the towel's     
   two layers, called plies.    

252
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,957
    this brand is made from     
     100% recycled fibers,      

253
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,229
     primarily white paper      
  obtained from office waste.   

254
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,498
  the paper goes into a large   
  machine called the pulper,    

255
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,633
     which breaks it up into    
            fibers,             

256
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,303
    then blends those fibers    
          with water            

257
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,206
           to produce           
a mushy substance called pulp.  

258
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,779
   a built-in filter removes    
 all the non-paper materials,   

259
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:33,718
    such as plastic windows     
  from envelopes and staples.   

260
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,922
  the next machine removes the  
               ink              
   by injecting the pulp with   
              air.              

261
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,058
        the ink detaches        
     from the pulp fibers       

262
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,459
and clings to the air bubbles,  

263
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,329
     which rise to the top      
        and drain off.          

264
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:51,136
 the pulp goes through a press, 
     which, with a series of    
            rollers,            

265
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,505
    squeezes out the water.     

266
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,883
        a screw conveyor        
    then breaks up the pulp     

267
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:07,018
          and moves it          
     to the next station,       

268
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,285
       which whitens it         

269
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,555
     with a peroxide-based      
       bleaching agent,         

270
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,224
   then rinses it thoroughly    
       with clean water.        

271
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,363
  next, and this is off limits  
         to the camera          

272
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,898
   for competitive reasons,     

273
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,635
           they apply           
a chemical wet-strength agent,  

274
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:27,505
   then form it into a sheet    
   of paper nearly eight feet   
             wide.              

275
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,908
    the wet-strength agent,     
     as the term suggests,      

276
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,045
     keeps the paper towel      
       intact when wet.         

277
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,047
            without             
  this fortifying treatment,    

278
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:40,051
     paper towels would be      
  as fragile as toilet paper.   

279
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,087
   after forming the paper,     

280
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,458
    the machine winds it up     
       into giant rolls.        

281
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,727
     these rolls will feed      
     the converting line,       

282
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,396
     the automated stations     
   which transform the paper    

283
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,631
      into paper towels.        

284
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:59,137
    two rolls feed the line     
        simultaneously,         

285
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,307
     each providing one ply     
  of the two-ply paper towel.   

286
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,919
      but before the plies      
   hit the converting line,     

287
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,289
 the factory's quality-control  
     lab analyzes samples       

288
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,092
in both the wet and dry state.  

289
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,028
      the testing machine       
 pulls both ends of the sample  

290
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,563
        until it tears,         

291
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,466
  measuring whether the paper   
meets strength specifications.  

292
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,905
    on the converting line,     

293
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,640
     one ply travels under      
     an embossing roller,       

294
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,311
    which presses a textured    
             design             
        onto the paper.         

295
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,114
  another roller then applies   
      a thin coat of glue       

296
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,483
    onto the raised portions    
        of the pattern.         

297
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,054
     the next station lays      
  the embossed and glued ply    

298
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,857
      on top of the second      
        still-flat ply.         

299
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,461
    then a fine-tooth knife     
  cuts the perforated lines,    

300
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,130
      which will separate       
     the individual sheets      

301
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,532
   on the paper towel roll.     

302
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:06,471
   the next machine winds 100   
    sheets around a cardboard   
             tube.              

303
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,240
       that's the length        
   of one paper towel roll.     

304
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,754
           a machine            
    called the accumulator      

305
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,156
     transports these logs,     
      as they're called,        

306
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,760
   to the cutting station...    

307
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:32,030
     where every 10 inches,     
    a rotating circular saw     

308
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,466
    slices through four logs    
        simultaneously.         

309
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,770
     this divides each log      

310
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,473
          into a dozen          
  finished paper towel rolls.   

311
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,912
    the next station groups     
    the rolls for packaging     

312
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,949
     either by 6 or by 12.      

313
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,320
     the packaging machine      
    encases the group rolls     

314
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,022
     in printed plastic...      

315
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,095
     ...then heat-seals the     
            wrapping            
            closed.             

316
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:13,605
    paper towel consumption     
 is highest in north america,   

317
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,442
    where factories produce     
  50 trillion rolls per year.
