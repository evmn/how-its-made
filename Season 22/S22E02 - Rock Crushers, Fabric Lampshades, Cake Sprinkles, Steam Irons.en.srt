   discovery communications     

3
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,520
    narrator: rock crushers     
      are brawny machines       

4
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,190
       designed to smash        
     big boulders to bits.      

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,661
  the broken rock is then used  
   to make asphalt pavement,    

6
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:04,196
 concrete building foundations, 
         ceramic tile,          

7
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,932
    and many other things.      

8
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,867
         modern society         
       is largely built         

9
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,170
    on the crushing strength    
  of these powerful machines.   

10
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:18,344
    if there's one invention    
     that's been a smashing     
            success,            

11
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:21,013
    it's the rock crusher.      

12
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,548
         these machines         
  are designed to pulverize.    

13
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,552
          this crusher          
  slams rocks against anvils    

14
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:30,423
        to shatter them         
  along natural stress lines.   

15
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,492
           they break           
into uniform cubicle particles  

16
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,428
     that can be processed      
  into many different things.   

17
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,700
       production starts        
    with the crusher's lid.     

18
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,635
     a computer-controlled      
         plasma torch           

19
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,837
 cuts through a sheet of steel  
      that's underwater.        

20
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,572
the water keeps the smoke down  

21
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,043
       as the plasma gas        
  makes a sharp, precise cut.   

22
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:58,050
   they feed a piece of steel   
back and forth between rollers  

23
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,119
          to shape it           
    into the crusher body.      

24
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:05,724
        with each pass,         
the strip curls a little more.  

25
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,992
    when the two ends meet,     

26
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,961
           the steel            
 is sufficiently cylindrical.   

27
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,401
         the technician         
      tack welds the ends       

28
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,604
        while the steel         
     is still in the rolling    
            machine.            

29
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:23,542
  this holds the shape so that  
    he can then do a complete   
             weld.              

30
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,277
    after a bit more work,      

31
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,814
   the crusher body is ready    
    for mounting to the base    
             frame.             

32
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,150
    they lower it into place    
        with the crane          

33
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,685
  and weld it to the section    

34
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,686
         that will hold         
     the electric motor and     
           pedestal.            

35
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,957
       after a paint job        
      and some fittings,        

36
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,228
       the focus turns to       
     the inside of the rock     
            crusher.            

37
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,164
 a worker bolts steel castings  
     to the interior wall.      

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,166
      the rugged castings       

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,704
    will protect the crusher    
     structure from damage      

40
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,674
  as rocks are slammed around   
    inside during crushing.     

41
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,844
     he secures the bolts       

42
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,514
        from the outside        
   of the crusher structure.    

43
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,385
 they're now ready to assemble  
the crusher bearing and shaft.  

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,923
           the worker           
   starts with the bearing.     

45
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,724
  he carefully aims a torch at  
              it,               

46
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,393
        and the exposure        
      to the steady flame       

47
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,664
 causes the bearing to expand.  

48
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,399
    when it's large enough,     

49
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,537
      he lowers the shaft       
       into the bearing.        

50
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,676
     as the bearing cools,      

51
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,345
    it shrinks to the shaft     
       for a tight fit.         

52
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,814
   this takes several hours.    

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,483
   then he heats the opening    

54
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,619
       in a part known as       
     the pedestal housing       

55
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,688
        to enlarge it.          

56
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,892
      he inserts the shaft      
 and bearing assembly into it.  

57
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:52,764
       the housing cools        
  and shrinks to the bearing.   

58
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,100
        they also equip         
  the other end of the shaft    

59
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,569
    with a bearing and cap,     

60
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,570
       and then it's time       
        for a test run.         

61
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,108
  they run each pedestal unit   
         for two hours          

62
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,311
  so a computer can thoroughly  
    assess its performance.     

63
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:11,250
  the pedestal shaft assembly   
 has passed a gamut of tests.   

64
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:16,254
           it's ready           
    to go into the crusher.     

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,692
     the installer bolts it     
  to the frame in six places.   

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,336
         he attaches it         
     to the protruding shaft    
            bearing             

67
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,404
by heat shrinking it in place.  

68
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,674
 he reinforces the installation 
      with two locknuts.        

69
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:40,011
           meanwhile,           
    a robot welds brackets      

70
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,549
  onto a machined steel plate   
     that will serve as the     
           impeller.            

71
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,618
          the impeller          
    is a kind of turntable      

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,090
 that revolves to toss the rock 
  into anvils to shatter it.    

73
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,492
 they attach parts called shoes 
       to the brackets.         

74
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,064
   they transfer the impeller   
        to the crusher          

75
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,233
    and bolt it to the hub.     

76
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:05,237
       a worker installs        
      chrome and white iron     
           castings.            

77
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,105
 the castings are the anvils.   

78
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,441
      arranged in a ring,       

79
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,310
         they serve as          
     the striking surface       

80
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,778
        for the rocks.          

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,316
  he installs them on an angle  
  and locks them in position.   

82
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,652
  the crane transfers the ring  
        to the crusher,         

83
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,355
         and the anvils         
  now surround the impeller.    

84
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,664
   with all of the components   
           in place,            

85
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,067
    it's time to put the lid    
     on the rock crusher.       

86
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,069
    a worker presses a decal    
    with brand information      

87
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,941
       onto the outside.        

88
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,609
    they install the electric   
             motor,             

89
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:48,948
 and this crusher is now ready  
  to reduce rocks to rubble.    

90
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,432
     narrator: a lampshade      
    is primarily practical.     

91
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,834
          it diffuses           
  the light that bulbs emit.    

92
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,037
         it also serves         
     a decorative purpose.      

93
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,974
   what the shade is made of,   
      its shape, and size       

94
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,710
         all influence          
    the style of the lamp,      

95
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:21,046
  so much so that you can give  
 an old lamp a whole new look   

96
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,681
  just by changing the shade.   

97
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,920
        whether the look        
     is modern or classic,      

98
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,788
   putting the perfect shade    
       on your lamp base        

99
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,057
   is always a bright idea.     

100
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,794
   manufacturing a lampshade    
    begins with the frame.      

101
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:39,465
    it's made of steel wire     
   3 or 4 millimeters thick,    

102
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,200
 depending on the shade size.   

103
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,535
       a computer-guided        
        forming machine         

104
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:48,340
 pulls the wire off the spindle 
     and straightens it with    
            rollers.            

105
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,742
        then the machine        
    bends and cuts the wire     

106
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,745
         into the shape         
   of each frame component.     

107
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,146
        for each frame,         

108
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,416
  the machine makes two rings   
  in the shape of the shade,    

109
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,352
    typically round, square,    
        or rectangular.         

110
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:09,662
         then it makes          
   three "l"-shaped pieces.     

111
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,434
          to assemble           
     the top of the frame,      

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,772
    they place one "l"-shaped   
              piece             
at a time in a positioning jig  

113
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:23,041
     alongside a steel loop     
       with three tabs.         

114
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:28,580
     they weld an "l" piece     
    to each of those tabs.      

115
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:33,052
   next, they take each ring    
      and weld it closed.       

116
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,730
     they weld the free end     
   of the "l"-shaped pieces     

117
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,432
     to one of the rings.       

118
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,342
         this completes         
     the top of the frame.      

119
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:59,611
       the remaining ring       
forms the bottom of the frame.  

120
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,348
   workers spray both of them   
      with paint powder.        

121
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,951
      then the frame parts      
        enter an oven,          

122
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:10,555
     which bakes the powder     
    into a durable coating.     

123
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,158
         at the core of         
    the fabric portion of the   
             shade              

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,963
 is a sheet of pvc plastic that 
has an adhesive on both sides.  

125
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,765
  working one side at a time,   

126
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,634
         they peel off          
     the paper covering the     
           adhesive,            

127
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,503
      then apply the fabric     
           gradually,           

128
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,940
   carefully smoothing it out   
as they go to prevent creases.  

129
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:36,114
       this lampshade has       
   cream-colored linen on one   
              side              

130
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,852
      and patterned cotton      
         on the other.          

131
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:43,855
  once they've applied fabric   
    to both sides of the pvc    
             sheet,             

132
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,926
    a computer-guided cutter    
    cuts out the shape of the   
             shade.             

133
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:53,198
    it also cuts through the    
             inside             
   of the fabric and the pvc    

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,402
    all along the perimeter     
  half an inch from the edge.   

135
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:01,807
   this leaves a small border   
    of only outside fabric.     

136
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,142
  they apply double-sided tape  
        to this border          

137
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,479
     on the top and bottom      
         of the shade.          

138
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:12,551
    they run a bead of glue     
      down one side edge,       

139
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,354
  then fold the outside fabric  
 border over the inner fabric.  

140
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,457
    this gives the lampshade    
         a neat seam.           

141
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,561
       now they assemble        
       fabric and frame,        

142
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,030
starting with the bottom ring.  

143
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:28,033
        they position it        
   just above the double-sided  
              tape              

144
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,234
       along the border,        

145
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,702
  then they remove the paper    

146
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,438
           to expose            
  the tape's adhesive surface   

147
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,208
    and fold the tape border    
    tightly over the frame.     

148
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,653
    they stand up the shade     
      on its bottom ring        

149
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:53,124
   and position the top ring    
          with clips.           

150
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:57,396
    then they peel, fold, and   
              stick             
   the fabric border over the   
              ring              

151
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,831
     just as they did on the    
            bottom.             

152
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,007
     they press all around      

153
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,677
    to smooth out the fabric    
  and ensure it adheres well.   

154
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,014
   then, using a bent spoon,    

155
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:20,351
    they push the edge of the   
             fabric             
    in behind the curved wire   
             frame.             

156
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,421
          this creates          
     a neat, rounded rim.       

157
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,091
           they seal            
  the shade's vertical seam,    

158
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,695
     applying glue to both      
 the inside and outside edges.  

159
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,773
       they weigh it down       
    for about half an hour      

160
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,243
  until the glue fully cures.   

161
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,314
    the shade is now ready      

162
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,851
     to add its personality     
     to an awaiting base.       

163
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,053
    with all the lampshade's    
            styles,             

164
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,990
        shapes, colors,         
 and fabrics available today,   

165
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:01,393
       any lamp can have        
    multiple personalities.     

166
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,542
           narrator:            
      believe it or not,        

167
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,612
    cake sprinkles have been    
             around             
  since the late 18th century   

168
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,949
   when french confectioners    
   used them as decorations.    

169
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:28,152
     chocolate sprinkles are    
            believed            
 to have been invented in 1936  

170
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,623
  by a dutchman responding to   
    a little boy's request      

171
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,626
for a chocolate bread topping.  

172
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,629
         cake sprinkles         
  come in a variety of colors   

173
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:42,033
   and can be found decorating  
               and              
 adding texture to many treats  

174
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:47,172
  such as cupcakes, doughnuts,  
    ice cream, and cookies.     

175
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,240
     they can quickly turn      
         a tasty treat          

176
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,444
  into a visual one, as well.   

177
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,847
 a variety of liquid and powder 
        food colorants          

178
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,248
   are among the ingredients    

179
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,921
       used to make these       
 colorful dessert decorations.  

180
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,458
         shortening is          
 one of the other ingredients.  

181
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,997
     a worker adds an exact     
            quantity            
    of shortening to a mixing   
             tank.              

182
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:17,935
  water in the tank is heated   
  as the mixture is agitated.   

183
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,206
        within minutes,         
 the ingredients are absorbed.  

184
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,076
  a worker adds powdered sugar  
        to a dry mixer.         

185
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,479
   by the time all the needed   
              sugar             
        has been added,         

186
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,914
     the machine is full.       

187
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,887
 he adds a pre-measured amount  
   of liquid food colorant.     

188
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,624
  different food colorants and  
different amounts of colorants  

189
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,359
   produce different-colored    
           sprinkles            

190
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:44,162
     and different shades of    
            colors.             

191
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,564
          the mixture           
    of water and shortening     

192
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,433
  are added to the dry mixer    

193
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:54,039
 containing the powdered sugar  
         and colorant.          

194
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,277
  he closes the lid and begins  
   the dough-mixing process.    

195
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,449
    about 15 minutes later,     
    a worker opens the lid      

196
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,387
  to reveal the freshly mixed   
      and colorful dough.       

197
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:12,724
   a worker pushes the dough    
along a conveyor into a chute.  

198
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,859
          it leads to           
    a wide collection area      

199
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,328
 and another conveyor machine   

200
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,597
     which moves the dough      
      toward an extruder.       

201
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,802
          as the dough          
   falls into the extruder,     

202
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,005
      it's forced through       
       many small holes.        

203
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,409
           it emerges           
 as these long, narrow strands  

204
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,478
           which fall           
    onto another conveyor.      

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,814
    the holes through which     
      the dough is forced       

206
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,215
      are in a big plate.       

207
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,752
    to make sure the quality    
 of the product doesn't vary,   

208
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,087
        room temperature        
    in the production area      

209
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,221
       is kept constant,        

210
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,858
   and the relative humidity    
        is kept at 50%.         

211
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,964
     that same ambient air      
        dries the dough         

212
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:57,702
 as it moves along the conveyor 
       through a tunnel.        

213
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,839
        about 10 seconds        
  after it enters the tunnel,   

214
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:05,443
  it falls into a holding vat   
         with a pail.           

215
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,913
   a worker sifts through the   
             dough              

216
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,450
          to make sure          
     it's properly dried.       

217
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,185
   she lifts the dough-filled   
              pail              

218
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,154
   and places it on a trolley   
  for the trip to a tumbler.    

219
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:23,862
 the tumbler breaks the strands 
      into smaller sizes.       

220
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,997
    the dough usually spends    
    about 10 minutes here.      

221
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,701
 any longer and the strand bits 
      will be too small.        

222
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:36,541
   a nozzle sprays a mixture    
    of confectioner's glaze     

223
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,876
       and carnauba wax.        

224
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,011
        the mixer keeps         
      the cake sprinkles        

225
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,279
      from leaking color        

226
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:45,083
      once they're placed       
     in finished products.      

227
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,884
    now dried and trimmed for   
             size,              

228
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,955
 a worker removes the sprinkles 
       from the tumbler         

229
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:54,025
         and pours them         
     onto a shaker table.       

230
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,094
properly-sized pieces of dough  

231
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,697
     fall through a screen      
   along with smaller pieces    

232
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,501
   as larger clumps are sorted  
              out.              

233
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,102
        before dropping         
     to another conveyor,       

234
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,438
     a second filter below      
 removes under-sized granules.  

235
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,043
    the sprinkles fall into     
a plastic-lined packaging tub.  

236
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,781
         cake sprinkles         
 come in a variety of colors.   

237
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,916
           a tumbler            
 mixes all the colors together  

238
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,053
      in order to package       
   a multi-colored product.     

239
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,194
  the various colors are mixed  
     together for about five    
            minutes             

240
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,263
        before a worker         
      samples the mixture       

241
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,832
    to make sure the variety    
   of colors is consistent.     

242
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,871
       once the sprinkles       
  have been thoroughly mixed,   

243
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,139
         they fall into         
      a line of bottles.        

244
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,343
     a jet of air directed      
   at the top of the bottles    

245
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:49,147
        keeps sprinkles         
    away from the cap area.     

246
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,950
      the capping machine       
  not only positions the cap,   

247
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:56,555
    it also spins the bottle    
 to screw the cap into place.   

248
00:15:56,557 --> 00:16:02,494
       the capped bottles       
  head to the labeling area.    

249
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,830
       an adhesive label        
   is applied to the bottle.    

250
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:10,335
  these colorful sprinkles are  
    sure to make any dessert    
            dazzle.             

251
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,387
    narrator: the steam iron    
  is a 20th-century invention   

252
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,656
       that makes ironing       
       less of a chore.         

253
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,925
     less physical effort is    
            required            

254
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:37,328
       because the steam        
 opens the weave of the fabric  

255
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,398
        so that creases         
    can be smoothed out more    
             easily             

256
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,567
    by the heated sole of the   
             iron.              

257
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,140
         in the past,           

258
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,542
   people used heavy wedges of  
              iron              
      heated over a fire        

259
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,144
      to press clothing,        

260
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,081
    and so they became known    
           as irons.            

261
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,083
   but today's electric irons   
 aren't made from iron at all.  

262
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,821
    they're made with lighter   
              stuff             
  like plastic and aluminum.    

263
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,360
     production starts with     
     this injection-molding     
            machine.            

264
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,295
     once the mold closes,      

265
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,297
  nozzles inject three streams  
 of plastic into the cavities,  

266
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,301
  each one a different color.   

267
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,770
      the plastic hardens       
    into a tri-colored part     

268
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,706
    that is the upper shell     
  of the iron and its handle.   

269
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,310
  the plastic shell will also   
    serve as the iron's water   
             tank.              

270
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,048
           the robot            
  transfers the molded parts    

271
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,650
    to automated scissors.      

272
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,521
          the scissors          
    snip off unwanted bits      

273
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,457
        that were formed        
   as plastic flowed into the   
             mold.              

274
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:45,997
        the next robot          

275
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,934
    transfers a plastic ring    
    to a printing station.      

276
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,536
       this ring will be        
   the temperature indicator    

277
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,472
     for the control knob.      

278
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,874
         another robot          
    stamps the measurements     

279
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:59,343
and other information onto it.  

280
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,747
    nozzles inject a ceramic    
             liquid             
  into the iron's aluminum base 
               --               

281
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,151
      the sole plate which      
 contains the heating element.  

282
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,353
      the ceramic will aid      
  in the production of steam    

283
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,557
     by breaking the surface    
             tension            
  of the water from the tank.   

284
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,426
    a worker places a cover     
   on top of the sole plate,    

285
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,063
         and a machine          
     rivets them together.      

286
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:25,236
 there's a cover for the bottom 
  of the sole plate, as well,   

287
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,772
 fittingly known as the shoe.   

288
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,943
    an injector coats all the   
             rivets             
     in the sole plate with     
           silicone.            

289
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,648
          the silicone          
   serves as a kind of glue,    

290
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,950
   keeping the rivets tight.    

291
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,588
       a robot transfers        
    the sole plate assembly     

292
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,890
       to a heating unit        
     to cure the silicone.      

293
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,596
         another robot          

294
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,531
      pumps compressed air      
      into the sole plate       

295
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,401
      to check for leaks.       

296
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,804
   the sole plate cools down    
    from the silicone cure      

297
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,474
     on the ride to the next    
            station.            

298
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,276
       while just ahead,        

299
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:10,615
  robots nimbly bend and twist  
 wires to a precise geometry.   

300
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:18,423
  these robots are faster than  
      humans and incredibly     
           accurate.            

301
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,559
          afterwards,           
 another robot welds the wires  

302
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,895
    to a post on the iron's     
   temperature-control unit.    

303
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:27,032
           a carriage           
  shuttles the unit forward,    

304
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,700
  and the next robot retrieves  
               it               

305
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,036
        and transfers it        
     to the iron sole plate     
           assembly.            

306
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:39,844
         another robot          
    adjusts the unit's knob     

307
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:44,849
           until it's           
   in the correct position.     

308
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,452
          they install          
   an aluminum silicate disk    

309
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,454
to protect the knob from heat.  

310
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,988
   a robot applies hot glue     

311
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,458
        into the grooves        
  of the iron's heat shield,    

312
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,660
     which will also serve      
   as the bottom of the water   
             tank.              

313
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,930
  with the glue still liquid,   

314
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,800
         another robot          
   transfers the iron upper to  
              it,               

315
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,469
      and the glue cures.       

316
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:08,272
    up until now, the robots    
  have done most of the work,   

317
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,008
         but it's time          
  for a helping hand or two.    

318
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,344
       a worker transfers       
    the iron upper assembly     

319
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,813
      to the bottom one.        

320
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,615
      after the two parts       
       have been secured        

321
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,617
  and a leak test performed,    

322
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:22,387
         another worker         
connects the power cord to it.  

323
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,096
   she encloses the back with   
 another molded plastic part.   

324
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:35,499
    another worker installs     
       the steam and spray      
          subassembly.          

325
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,969
     this part has an intake    
             channel            
         for fill ups           

326
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,106
        and a mechanism         
     to control the steam.      

327
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,975
         it's time for          
  a thorough electrical test.   

328
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,244
       they plug it in,         

329
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,046
  and a robot turns the knob    

330
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:50,415
        while a computer        
   monitors its performance.    

331
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:58,923
     a worker then examines     
     the steam iron from all    
            angles.             

332
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,960
    with her final approval,    
   it's ready for packaging.    

333
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,132
     with robots and humans     
      working in tandem,        

334
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:10,435
    it takes just 10 minutes    
   to assemble a steam iron.    

335
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,776
    piles of rumpled laundry    
             await,             
   so it's full steam ahead.    

336
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,957
