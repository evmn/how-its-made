narrator: on the battlegrounds of american history,       

4
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,721
powder horns were everywhere.  

5
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,255
these modified cow horns     

6
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,858
served as carrying cases for gunpowder          

7
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,862
in 18th century colonial battles and the american revolution.   

8
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,198
for soldiers engaged in heated battle,        

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,669
the containers were a good way to keep their powder dry.    

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,209
with the invention of ammunition cartridges in the 19th century,            

11
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,879
muzzle-loading firearms and powder horns         

12
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,546
became a thing of the past.   

13
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,749
but today, they're back.     

14
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,885
powder horns are in demand for historical re-enactments   

15
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,889
and among some sportsmen and collectors.         

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,229
the concept of using a cow horn to make a gunpowder container  

17
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:41,367
demonstrates the resourcefulness of people in an earlier time.  

18
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,838
cow horns were accessible.    

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,709
they're naturally hollow, lightweight, and waterproof.   

20
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:55,514
to start, the craftsman selects the cow horn       

21
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:59,451
and evaluates it for structural flaws.      

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,388
finding no cracks or weaknesses in this one,    

23
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,588
he proceeds.           

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,192
he scrapes off the scale to clean it           

25
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,695
and get a better look at its condition.        

26
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:18,136
next, he identifies the depth of the cavity     

27
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,538
with a thin wire.        

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,608
this tells him where the hollow section ends  

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,476
and the horn becomes solid.   

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,546
he marks the spot        

31
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:32,351
then draws another line 1 1/2 inches down.        

32
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,620
these markings serve as guides  

33
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,957
as he now turns the tip of the horn into a spout.    

34
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,227
he cuts off the pointed end along the second line.      

35
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,497
he drills into the horn     

36
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,034
all the way through to the horn cavity.       

37
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,706
he lays out the design of the spout with rubber rings.             

38
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:58,644
he traces around them      

39
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,781
and then scores the horn at the pencil marks.       

40
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,852
he files the horn around the score marks      

41
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,455
to give the spout end the desired contours       

42
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,123
and builds up a ringed ridge   

43
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:15,194
for the powder-horn strap to rest against.         

44
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,762
next, he gouges the horn     

45
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,065
to create ornamental notches above the spout.         

46
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,368
this is known an engrailing.   

47
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,475
he pencils lettering onto the side of the powder horn.   

48
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,082
he scratches the horn along the penciled lines     

49
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,218
to engrave the letters into it.               

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,554
historically, powder horns were a soldier's canvas     

51
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,090
upon which he etched maps, designs,     

52
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:49,161
and personal information.    

53
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:53,432
he rubs ink onto the lettering, and it seeps into the fine cuts.              

54
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,300
when he wipes off the ink,    

55
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:59,304
it remains in the engravings  
to make them really stand out.  

56
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,439
he slices the other end of the cow horn         

57
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,110
to create an even edge.     

58
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:08,514
then, he boils butternut hulls and wood chips in water     

59
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,984
to make a dye.          

60
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,854
he immerses the powder horn in the dye for about an hour   

61
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,056
to give it a look        

62
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:22,595
that would take decades to achieve naturally.      

63
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:27,465
it gives the powder horn a yellowed, more aged patina.  

64
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,270
he now carves a base plug from pinewood.          

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,873
he trims the rough shape     

66
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,542
to the exact curvature of the horn.           

67
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:42,214
he inserts the plug and ensures it's a snug fit.   

68
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,082
he drills six holes into the horn          

69
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,551
and through to the plug.     

70
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,752
with a tack hammer,       

71
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,088
he drives wooden pegs into the holes,         

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,826
securing the plug permanently.  

73
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,095
he slices off the end of the wood       

74
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,063
to make it flush to the horn.  

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,036
he stains the wood plug with shoe dye          

76
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,472
to make it blend in with the color of the horn.   

77
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,311
once the stain has dried,    

78
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,713
he creates a hook for a shoulder strap.      

79
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:15,981
he drills holes         

80
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,250
that are a little smaller than the hook          

81
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,585
so that when he pounds it into the holes,         

82
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,321
the hook is firmly installed.  

83
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,259
he loops the strap through the hook         

84
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,360
and stitches it up.       

85
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,732
he inserts a wooden stopper into the spout,         

86
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,469
and this powder horn is now ready for containment.  

87
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,806
but mostly, it will just hang around     

88
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,042
as a reminder of another time.  

89
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,028
narrator: mass-produced glass items    

90
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,631
are typically shaped by automated machines,      

91
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:09,234
which insert molten glass into an assembly line of molds.             

92
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,771
specialty items are usually cast individually  

93
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,841
with the artist manually planting the molten glass    

94
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:20,379
in a mold crafted by skilled mold-makers.     

95
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,515
these molds for making specialty glass items      

96
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,250
are entirely handcrafted.    

97
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,320
this one, comprised of three sections,   

98
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:32,191
produces the ornate shade of a glass candle lamp.     

99
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,926
this one, comprised of two sections,    

100
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,729
produces the lamp's base.    

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,002
the glass manufacturer submits the design sketch of the item  

102
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,004
to the mold shop.        

103
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,073
the shop, using computer software,     

104
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,609
converts the sketch into technical drawings.     

105
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,744
then following the drawings,   

106
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,214
workers prepare a wooden pattern of the mold.           

107
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,016
they first make a cardboard template       

108
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,884
for each mold section,      

109
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,355
then trace the template on a piece of wood,       

110
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:07,693
saw along the pencil line,    

111
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,063
then finalize the shape with a sander.          

112
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,902
they send the patterns for the mold sections to a foundry,            

113
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,538
which casts copies in iron.   

114
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,311
these iron castings are rough,  

115
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,647
so when they return from the foundry,        

116
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,649
the mold-makers refine each section       

117
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,851
with a series of milling machines.       

118
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,988
this takes a tremendous degree of expertise,          

119
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,326
as these are not computer-guided automated machines.       

120
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:43,996
these skilled tradesmen maneuver the mills manually,   

121
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:47,066
following the technical drawings.     

122
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,080
once they finalize the shape,  

123
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,684
they use a drill press to bore holes for the hefty pins     

124
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:11,289
on which the mold sections will pivot open and closed.   

125
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,692
iron is the ideal material for glass molds         

126
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,961
because it withstands a temperature          

127
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:20,231
of over 2,000 degrees fahrenheit for molten glass.        

128
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,501
iron does expand with such heat.              

129
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,703
however, once cool, it contracts            

130
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:29,441
and resumes its original shape without any distortion.     

131
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,376
they mount the mold section on a lathe   

132
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,978
to begin forming the cavity.   

133
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,580
using a tool called a boring bar,       

134
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:41,019
a mold-maker shapes the cavity 
as per the technical drawings.  

135
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,655
then he takes the mold section off the lathe          

136
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,323
and paints the cavity yellow   

137
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,059
to give him a bright background           

138
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:50,862
against which to sketch out the fine details of the design.             

139
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,465
this particular pattern features circles,        

140
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,402
which he sketches with compasses.         

141
00:08:56,404 --> 00:09:00,005
using an arsenal of chisels with              
different size and shape tips,  

142
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,342
he chips the metal       
to carve out what he sketched.  

143
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:16,755
again, he follows the technical drawings meticulously,      

144
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,626
giving the carved lines the specified depth and profile.            

145
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,899
once he finishes the pattern,  

146
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,300
he mounts the mold section    

147
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,835
on one side of a mechanical copying machine   

148
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,104
called a pantograph.       

149
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,639
on the other side,        

150
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,775
he mounts another section of the mold           

151
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,044
which doesn't yet have the carved pattern.       

152
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,714
the pantograph stylus traces the pattern on the carved section  

153
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,450
and simultaneously moves an engraving tool        

154
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,587
through the identical motions on the uncarved section,     

155
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,689
transferring the pattern.    

156
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,130
because this is a three-sectioned mold,     

157
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,799
they make two copies on the pantograph.        

158
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,136
the carving tools leave marks on the surface of the cavity,  

159
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:07,639
so the next step is to polish them away with emery paper.   

160
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,550
on the right, you can see the marks.      

161
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,987
and on the left, the smooth, polished surface.  

162
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,494
the sections are now ready to be assembled with pins    

163
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,164
into a complete mold.      

164
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,233
when it's time to pour in the molten glass,   

165
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,702
the pins enable the sections to close and interlock.     

166
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,705
once the glass cools and solidifies,         

167
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:44,576
the pins make it easier to open the mold to extract the casing.             

168
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:49,114
glass artisans and glass manufacturers alike  

169
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,516
use handcrafted molds      

170
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,185
to produce a wide variety of glass items          

171
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,687
from functional to fancy.    

172
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,605
narrator:            
the perogi is a pillowy pastry  

173
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,407
stuffed with mashed potato or other fillings.        

174
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,077
popular for centuries in eastern europe,        

175
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,546
perogies were initially peasant food.     

176
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:25,617
but today, their appeal crosses            
class and cultural boundaries,  

177
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,621
and worldwide there's a growing appetite for perogies.            

178
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,892
perogies are comfort food,    

179
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,762
traditionally made from scratch             

180
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:39,431
by generations of polish grandmothers.     

181
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,500
but today, few people have time for all that work,   

182
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,502
and the job of making perogies  

183
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,238
has moved from the kitchen to the factory.         

184
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,475
all you have to do is add the sour cream and chives.    

185
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:57,382
production starts with     
the potato and cheese filling.  

186
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,451
they boil potatoes until tender.             

187
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,323
then, still piping hot,     

188
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,928
they transfer the potatoes to a mixer grinder.       

189
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,732
they add a generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese    

190
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,667
along with some salt and spices.             

191
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,841
a spiraling blade mashes and mixes the ingredients.    

192
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,545
the blade misses a few chunks of potato,     

193
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,214
so the machine forces the ingredients      

194
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,083
through a perforated metal plate.    

195
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,418
it gets rid of the chunks    

196
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,822
and leaves the mix smooth and creamy.        

197
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,693
with the filling done,      

198
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:44,429
it's over to the dough department.     

199
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,967
they pour measured amounts of flour into a mixer.      

200
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,704
they add oil for texture and flavor      

201
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,641
and some salt to further enhance the taste.  

202
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,179
they open an overhead tap,    

203
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:05,650
and a measured amount of water 
flows directly into the mixer.  

204
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:09,387
the mixer's roller bars blend and knead the dough    

205
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,858
to a fairly thick consistency.  

206
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,662
after leaving the dough to soften a bit,         

207
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,765
they feed it to a special perogi-making machine.      

208
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,839
the potato and cheese filling flows into the same machine.   

209
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,678
it forces both the filling and the dough          

210
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,346
into a forming device.      

211
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,948
it's enclosed for safety reasons,       

212
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,950
so you can't see it here.    

213
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,421
inside, the machine shapes the filling           

214
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,489
into a cylindrical form     

215
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,225
and the dough around it into a sleeve.          

216
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,837
here, the machine pumps out a roll of potato filling,    

217
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,240
the dough surrounds it, creating sausage-like form.   

218
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,045
as the filled dough exits,    

219
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,651
a roller shapes it into individual perogies.    

220
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:14,986
it also cuts and crimps the edges.      

221
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,059
this produces uniformly plump perogies     

222
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,394
at an incredible speed.     

223
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,132
this machinery churns out 50,000 perogies an hour.     

224
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,340
the freshly formed perogies ride by a divider mechanism   

225
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,941
that separates them,       

226
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:40,579
preventing clumping as they transfer to another conveyor.  

227
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,550
an inspector rejects any defective dumplings     

228
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,653
so that only perfect perogies head into a freezer.       

229
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:57,629
the temperature inside     
is an icy negative-50 degrees.  

230
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:00,632
it's a winding journey on spiraling tiers,       

231
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:05,169
where they chill for about 14 minutes.      

232
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,105
when they exit,         

233
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,308
they're frozen solid and ready for packaging.     

234
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,643
the dumplings ride a series of conveyors    

235
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,111
towards the packaging line.   

236
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,382
it's a quick journey, giving them no time to thaw.   

237
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,521
the perogies funnel into weigh stations.       

238
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:28,326
below, mechanical fingers open bags.            

239
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:33,398
the scale releases 22 ounces of perogies into each bag.    

240
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,436
that's about 23 perogies per bag.             

241
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:44,408
hot jaws seal the plastic.    

242
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,145
the bags of perogies travel through an x-ray station     

243
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,347
on their way to the warehouse freezer.    

244
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,149
it scans them for bits of metal or glass    

245
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,153
that may have contaminated the perogies during production.           

246
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:00,492
today, perogies have many different fillings.     

247
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,361
there are even fruit-filled ones for dessert,           

248
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,666
the recipe may be centuries old, but there are a few new tricks.             

249
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,648
narrator: the earliest tires   

250
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,051
were bands of steel fitted to wooden wheels,     

251
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,785
hardly a comfortable ride.    

252
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,253
air-filled inner tubes      

253
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,323
were part of the first successful car tire in 1911,   

254
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,593
and inner tubes are still used today       

255
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:38,497
in most bicycle tires and many motorcycle tires.    

256
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,536
these motorcycle inner tubes are made with a combination   

257
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,071
of synthetic and pure, natural rubber.    

258
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,543
they come in a variety of sizes and offer superior quality    

259
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,613
because no recycled or reclaimed rubber is used   

260
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,148
during the manufacturing process.    

261
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,818
a worker selects a slab of synthetic rubber,   

262
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,486
a package            
of chemically enhanced rubber,  

263
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,222
chemicals used as antioxidants,          

264
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,359
accelerators and curing agents,             

265
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:12,364
and finally a package of pure, natural rubber.     

266
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,436
a worker pulls the materials from an internal mixer      

267
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,638
and guides them into a two-roll mill,      

268
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,506
where they're squeezed together.            

269
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,310
he trims off the rubber sheet.  

270
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:29,914
ideally, the texture      
of the rubber sheet is smooth.  

271
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,652
carbon black provides pigmentation to the process   

272
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,453
and reinforces the rubber.    

273
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:39,123
the rubber is now sent for cooling.           

274
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,726
it soaks in a mixture of calcium carbonate,      

275
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,060
which, once dry,         

276
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,530
will prevent the rubber from sticking to itself.     

277
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,935
workers carefully fold     
the continuous sheet of rubber  

278
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,437
in a stack to dry.        

279
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,743
the next day, the rubber is cool and hard,   

280
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,213
and the calcium carbonate has dried into a powder.     

281
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,950
a worker places the small strip coming out of the two-roll mill              

282
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,952
onto an overhead conveyor belt,              

283
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,221
which takes it to the next phase of production.           

284
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,558
the strip falls into a extruding machine,    

285
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,260
where a turning screw forces the raw rubber      

286
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,895
through a strainer.       

287
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,165
a worker uses a wire       

288
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,634
to cut the rubber strands as they emerge.         

289
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,405
he places the rubber wad in the two-roll mill once again.             

290
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,444
the rubber will gradually be shaped     

291
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,448
in preparation for the next phase of extrusion.   

292
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,183
squeezed into a strip,      

293
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:41,452
the rubber falls into a tube extruder machine.  

294
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,321
as it passes through the die,  

295
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,458
it emerges in a cylindrical shape.     

296
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,327
the rubber tube is hot.     

297
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,528
water cools it down       

298
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,631
and cleans away any remaining residue.      

299
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,737
the rubber tube now enters a cutting machine.  

300
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,541
calcium carbonate powder helps prevent sticking.     

301
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,143
after being cut,         

302
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,212
a hole is punched in the tube and a valve inserted.      

303
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,615
the first cone punches the hole.              

304
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,618
the second inserts the valve.  

305
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,686
a worker replaces each valve   

306
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,156
after it's been inserted into the rubber tube.      

307
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,328
this machine can process 22 tubes per minute.       

308
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:31,302
here is the rubber tube with the hole punched      

309
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,172
and with the incomplete valve inserted.         

310
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:38,643
a worker now connects the two ends of the cut tube.  

311
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,646
he places both ends into the machine,        

312
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,650
which, using different steps, cuts and fuses them together.  

313
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,520
by the time the machine completes the process,      

314
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,055
the worker has two more loose ends in place.  

315
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,459
first, the knife cuts both ends of the tube.      

316
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:58,129
by clearing away the calcium carbonate powder,  

317
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,999
the two heated ends can stick together.       

318
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,002
no glue is needed.        

319
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,870
the cut is clean and straight.  

320
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,474
heat, combined with the rubber's natural stickiness,           

321
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:12,543
firmly holds the seam together.            

322
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,681
a worker now pumps air into the circular tube.     

323
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,684
he hammers wax into the incomplete valve    

324
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,521
in order to temporarily seal the air inside.       

325
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,760
another worker places the tube in a mold.            

326
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,895
it will be heated for a few minutes,        

327
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,297
part of the vulcanization process.    

328
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,767
the wax that held the air inside has melted,           

329
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,036
but after being vulcanized in the mold,           

330
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,573
the tube retains its cylindrical shape.      

331
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,842
to flatten the shaped tube,   

332
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:47,979
any air remaining inside is removed using a vacuum.    

333
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,381
these workers give the inner tube       

334
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,583
its finishing touches.      

335
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:55,920
they complete the valve by adding a core,        

336
00:20:55,922 --> 00:21:00,658
followed by a ring, a nut, and a valve cap.         

337
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,527
they fold the finished inner tube     

338
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,397
and circle it with two elastic bands.     

339
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,868
the folded inner tubes are inserted in packaging    

340
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,937
that is then heat sealed.    

341
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,539
ready to hit the open road,   

342
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,710
these motorcycle inner tubes  
are sure to get riders pumped.  

343
