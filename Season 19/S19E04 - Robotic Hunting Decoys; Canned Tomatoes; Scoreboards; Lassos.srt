 ample time to penetrate and do

 the first step is to drill out

00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:31,736
 this creates a pocket in which 
 to install the plastic housing

 the final step is to mount the 
 head on to the body, inserting

  a worker then feeds narrower  
   strips of steel to a press   
              that bends back t 

108
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:52,310
             tabs.              
 these strips will serve as the 

109
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:56,514
    the tabs will be used to    
             install            
             them.   using a sp 

110
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:01,186
  air tool, a worker clinches   
  the tabs to the back of the   

111
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:05,857
      this tool punches and     
            stretches           
   the steel to interlock it,   
    joining the parts without u 

112
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:12,797
   screws, rivets, or welds.    
   he fastens four strips to th 

113
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,269
      he then attaches the      
           plasma-cut           
    front panel to complete the 

114
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:23,675
        the scoreboard.         
    the next worker sprays a    

115
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:29,280
     the entire scoreboard.     
    then it is into a giant     

116
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,285
     14 minutes to cure the     
         powder paint.  the res 

117
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:39,424
   powder-paint skin that will  
              make              
 it possible for the scoreboard 

118
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:45,497
 they are now ready for working 
        parts like l.e.d.       
          light-studded         
      digit boards, a data  tra 

119
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:49,568
         and receiver.          
  he connects the receiver to   

120
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:56,107
     it inside the cabinet.     
  he pulls the antenna through  
   a hole so it protrudes from  

121
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:02,647
 front, and he bends it out of  
        the way for now.        
        there are several light 

122
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,452
 digit plates on a scoreboard.  
   each can flash any number.   

123
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,590
 interconnecting them in what's 
     known as a daisy-chain con 

124
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:17,061
       he also plugs in a       
          ribbon-style          
  cable to link the digits to   

125
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:21,199
            module.             
  he inserts the digits in the  

126
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:26,138
      them with a sheet of      
           transparent          
         polycarbonate.   he sc 

127
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,410
   around each digit assembly   
         to secure it. he confi 

128
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:37,081
 good and that all the numbers  
           light up.    he conn 

129
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,686
   computer processing module   
  to the numbers and also wires 
               it   to a power  

130
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,891
    he mounts the module to a   
              panel             
  that will then be installed t 

131
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:54,499
      scoreboard cabinet.       
   an evening inkjet printer    

132
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,703
    on adhesive-backed paper    
        followed by some        
         fierce-looking team gr 

133
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:04,109
 later, a weatherproof coating  
  will be applied to the paper  

134
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:09,981
  they also use vinyl decals.   
   the worker peels away the  u 

135
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:15,053
         the lettering.         
    this is called weeding.  af 

136
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,724
 to applicator tape called the  
    pre-mask, she carefully     

137
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:25,530
  the front of the scoreboard.  
   satisfied that it's in the   

138
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:31,269
            the top.            
     she then peels off the     
            backing,  and the l 

139
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:41,213
           pre-mask.            
 using a squeegee, she presses  

140
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:50,822
  smoothing any messy-looking   
      bubbles or buckles. she r 

141
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:57,562
  then lifts the pre-mask very  
   carefully so as not to lift  
               any  of the deca 

142
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:02,500
 with all the lettering now in  
    place, the numbers on the   
              board   will mean 

143
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:08,105
     crowds in the stands.      
    they equip the scoreboard   
             with a             
   speaker and horn that will s 

144
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:14,946
      off in the event of a     
           touchdown.           
 and no need to run cable from  
      the scoreboard to the   k 

145
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,850
    it is operated by remote    
            control.            
   using that system, a worker  

146
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:24,322
 tests all the functions of the 
          scoreboard.           
    this test is thorough and t 

147
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,460
       about 20 minutes.        
  when it is done, he declares  

148
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:34,065
            action.             
   today's sports scoreboards   
              come   in any sha 

149
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:40,271
       customer desires.        
  when it comes to drumming up  

150
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,875
      scoreboard can be a       
         game-changer.          

151
00:15:43,877 --> 00:16:03,761
   >> narrator: a lasso, also   
 called a lariat, is a classic  

152
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:08,432
    catching running cattle.    
 on one end, there is a moving  

153
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:13,771
         animal's head.         
 this loop tightens around the  

154
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:23,982
   the animal in its tracks.    
    working a lasso requires    

155
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:30,054
     so much so that rodeos     
            typically           
    hold roping contests and    
             feature  performan 

156
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:34,992
           maneuvers.           
     the ropemaker starts by    
             looping   five nyl 

157
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,731
 bushing mounted on a traveling 
              box. he ties the  

158
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:44,101
   of three spinning eyes...    
   then runs the five threads   

159
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:49,207
 second spinning eye, then back 
        to the bushing.  he the 

160
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,679
  drives the traveling box to   
 another traveling box, pulling 

161
00:16:54,681 --> 00:17:01,886
     a length of 15 yards.      
 he transfers the threads from  
  the bushing to a spinning eye 

162
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:09,227
  this second traveling box...  
 then pulls the threads back to 
   make the other half of the r 

163
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:14,833
     when he arrives at the     
            starting            
  point, he loops the threads   

164
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:20,572
 then he pulls all the threads  
   to equal tension, cuts them  
              from              
   their spools, and ties them  

165
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:28,313
  this completes what's known   
   as the stringing process.    
     next comes the twisting    

166
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:34,251
     a motor turns the three    
            spinning            
 eyes, twisting the 10 threads  

167
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:40,191
   the three strands together   
              into              
   a lasso rope that's around   
     2/10th's of an inch in   d 

168
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:46,331
  the twisting force pulls the  
  two boxes toward each other.  

169
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:51,469
 amount of weight in each box.  
 that determines the stiffness  

170
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:59,744
    from extra soft to medium   
              hard.             
 a rope this length takes about 

171
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:05,550
   the ropemaker now wraps the  
               end              
  with electrical tape so that  
               the              
   rope won't unravel when he   

172
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:12,890
           it loose.            
    he pulls the rope at the    
             center   to releas 

173
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:21,232
 then just beyond the taped end 
    snips the strands free.  he 

174
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:28,439
   ends with a hot blade that   
    slices the nylon threads    

175
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:33,644
 he lays the rope in piping-hot 
              wax.   it seeps i 

176
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:39,451
    crannies, permeating the    
             threads            
    deep inside, setting the    
             twist.             

177
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:51,195
  after suspending the rope for 
                a               
   while to let the excess wax  
              drip              
    off, he connects it to a    

178
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:58,002
    mechanism inside a heated   
              room,             
  or, in summertime, outdoors   

179
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:03,074
   stretching for a couple of   
              days              
 pulls out any waves, ensuring  

180
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:09,681
           straight.            
 next, he cuts off the knot and 
  unravels just enough rope to  

181
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:15,086
   a knot for what's called a   
             hondo.             
   that's the eye in the rope w 

182
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:19,958
  lets him build the loop that  
      catches the animal.   on  

183
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,831
  different type of knot, one   
    which will keep the rope    

184
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:35,240
  using pliers and a vice, he   
   pulls both knots tight... sl 

185
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:46,917
  blade of the rope cutter...   
   then burns the ends with a   

186
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:56,527
    now, he ties the hondo.     
   the hondo slides along the   
              rope,  loosening  

187
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:03,001
             loop.              
  he hangs the hondo on a hook  
     and, using a specially     

188
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:13,144
     wheel, pulls it tight.     
     then he sews a piece of    
             rawhide   into the 

189
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:17,048
    this piece of leather is    
             called             
          the burner.           
    it prevents the eye from    

190
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:23,688
 through, meaning wearing out,  
as the rope slides through it.  

191
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,694
 he bangs it with a hammer to   

192
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,764
seat it in the rope grooves...  

193
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,700
 then stamps the company name   

194
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,368
  on it and marks the rope's    

195
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,437
          stiffness.            

196
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,373
lassos come in various degrees  

197
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,175
   of stiffness for different   
             types              

198
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,778
  of animals and purposes, such 
               as               

199
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,047
  roping cattle by the head or  
               by               

200
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,449
          the heels.
