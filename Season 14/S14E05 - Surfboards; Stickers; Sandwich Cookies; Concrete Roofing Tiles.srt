00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,788
 narrator: surfing is an ancient
       polynesian pastime,      

2
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,990
  first documented by europeans 
      in the 18th century.      

3
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:02,327
          in the 1920s,         
  the sport spread from hawaii  

4
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,396
  to the beaches of california. 

5
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,532
 back then, surfboards were made
         of solid wood.         

6
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,303
     today, they're made of     
lightweight synthetic materials.

7
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,677
      serious surfers have      
    their boards custom-made    

8
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,214
  and engineered for the types  
   of waves they'll be riding.  

9
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,617
 at the board's core is a piece 
      of polyurethane foam      

10
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,153
       with a wooden strip      
        down the center.        

11
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,289
the factory's shaping specialist

12
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,559
       inspects the board       
and checks the foam for defects.

13
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:39,364
     if all is well, he cuts    
 the board to the right length. 

14
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,601
     then he chooses a board    
 shape template from his library

15
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,771
         and traces it.         

16
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,073
          then he saws          
     along his pencil line.     

17
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,250
         using a planer,        
 he refines this starting shape 

18
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,853
        to the customer's       
         specifications.        

19
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,927
        when he finishes,       

20
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,431
     he checks to make sure     
    everything's symmetrical.   

21
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,936
   next, he shapes the edges.   

22
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,675
      with a power sander,      

23
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,411
  he flattens and smoothes out  
           the surface          

24
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,414
          then follows          
  with a fine sanding by hand.  

25
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,951
 before releasing the foam core 
     to the next department,    

26
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,820
   he checks the dimensions --  

27
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,924
      thickness, contours,      
       and the smoothness.      

28
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,633
     a lamination specialist    
         preps the board        

29
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,436
   to receive its first layer   
         of fiberglass.         

30
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,905
        he masks the top,       
        called the deck,        

31
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,709
   to shield it from the resin  
 he'll now apply to the bottom. 

32
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,445
          he lays down          
   the first fiberglass cloth,  

33
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,549
    leaving a 3-inch overlap    
      along the perimeter.      

34
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,720
next, he spreads polyester resin

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,857
 that's tinted to whatever color
      the customer ordered      

36
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,193
 all over the fiberglass cloth. 

37
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,864
      he folds the overlap      
        onto the deck...        

38
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,801
...then grinds the corners flat.

39
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:28,973
 he flips the board deck-side up
     and trims the overlap.     

40
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,411
    next, he covers the deck    
  in two layers of fiberglass.  

41
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:38,349
        in between them,        
 he pours clear polyester resin 

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,153
  then positions company logos  
     printed on rice paper.     

43
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:45,724
   the resin soaks the paper,   
       embedding the logo.      

44
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,465
       then another layer       
   of resin-coated fiberglass.  

45
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,904
   once that dries, he applies  
    yet another coat of resin   

46
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,974
   on both sides of the board.  

47
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:05,777
  using a router and template,  
   he cuts a hole for the box   

48
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,279
          that'll hold          
      the surfboard's fin.      

49
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,987
        he fills the hole       
        with black resin        

50
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,090
    then inserts the fin box.   

51
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,070
    now a sanding specialist    
           takes over.          

52
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,041
    he grinds the box flush,    
    which opens its fin slot.   

53
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,481
     then he gives the board    
       an overall sanding       

54
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,450
     to smooth the surface.     

55
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,556
  next stop is the paint room.  

56
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,626
  the painter uses masking tape 
    and an acrylic paint pen    

57
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,429
    to decorate the surfboard   
      with black pin lines.     

58
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,899
         once they dry,         
       he masks the board       

59
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,703
       and air-brushes in       
        a white pin line.       

60
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,772
      once dry, he applies      
    a finishing coat of resin   

61
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,075
     over the entire board.     

62
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,983
   now a polishing specialist   
            steps in.           

63
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,518
      after a fine sanding,     

64
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,188
    he buffs the entire board   
    with polishing compound,    

65
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,025
        producing a slick       
       high-gloss finish.       

66
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,532
   the factory ships the board  
     to the surfboard shop,     

67
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:38,403
where the customer chooses a fin
 from the many models available.

68
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,072
the fin screws into the fin box,

69
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,209
           and, dude,           
    the board is ready to go.   

70
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:04,295
     narrator: stickers have    
long been used in merchandising.

71
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,932
          but in 1979,          
     they took a crafty turn    

72
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,768
      with the introduction     
     of decorative stickers.    

73
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,305
     sticker art soon became    
        a popular hobby,        

74
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,142
  allowing anyone to engage in  
a little creative embellishment.

75
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,251
      stickers can be used      
    to accent greeting cards,   

76
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,589
 photo albums, or add a certain 
    flourish to any project.    

77
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,129
      every sticker begins      
       with a work of art.      

78
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,798
 the artist transfers the image 
          to a computer         

79
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:45,437
    and manipulates it until    
 the desired effect is achieved.

80
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:55,347
  next, a sheet of photopolymer 
 goes onto an exposure machine. 

81
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,016
      the technician places     
      a negative of the art     

82
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,685
            on top of           
     the photopolymer sheet.    

83
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:05,290
  he pulls plastic over the two 
  and closes the machine's lid. 

84
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,694
   inside, a vacuum pulls the   
  negative to the photopolymer. 

85
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,496
    intense ultraviolet light   

86
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,233
        transfers the art       
 to the photopolymer in seconds.

87
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,641
        he makes several        
  photopolymer printing plates, 

88
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,776
      each one a variation      
    of the original artwork.    

89
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,980
        they will be used       
   to layer pattern and color.  

90
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,581
     before they can print,     

91
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,652
    they have to make the art   
 stand out from the background. 

92
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,787
  this machine removes material 

93
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,457
           surrounding          
     the transferred images     

94
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,127
    using a special chemical    
     and a heavy-duty brush.    

95
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,065
because the images were hardened
      during the exposure,      

96
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,938
  they withstand the chemicals  
          and abrasion.         

97
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,539
  the process leaves the images 

98
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,941
         slightly raised        
    against a clear backdrop    

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,245
            and ready           
     for the printing press.    

100
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:06,084
  they wrap the printing plates 
        around cylinders.       

101
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,489
 the press operator examines the
  seam under a magnifying glass 

102
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,093
    to confirm that the edges   
     are perfectly aligned.     

103
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:22,967
      he loads the cylinder     
    into the printing press.    

104
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,837
    then he pours yellow ink    
     into a reservoir below.    

105
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,807
      and it's time to roll     
       the printing press.      

106
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,044
    rollers transfer the ink    
    to the printing cylinder,   

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,948
   and it prints the art onto   
 adhesive-backed sticker paper. 

108
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,454
      they use a different      
  printing plate for each color 

109
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,056
      to create variations      
         in the design.         

110
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,324
          as a result,          

111
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,361
      each of these hearts      
   ends up looking different.   

112
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,398
  it's all about layering color 
           and pattern          

113
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,269
   to give the sticker artists  
       plenty of options.       

114
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,610
    next, the press operator    
  prepares a cutting cylinder.  

115
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,545
   it cuts around the designs,  

116
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,383
   but only penetrates the top  
   layer of the sticker paper.  

117
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,153
        rollers pull off        
    the surrounding material.   

118
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:19,958
         they wind it up        
     for recycling offsite.     

119
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,363
    only the stickers remain    
         on the backing,        

120
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,232
      but they aren't ready     
   for the scrapbook just yet.  

121
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,368
         first it's over        
        to another press,       

122
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,905
      which hot-stamps foil     
         to the designs.        

123
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,108
          this process          
   is carefully choreographed.  

124
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,844
      a sensor on the press     
       detects the hearts       

125
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,781
      which are to be given     
      the metallic finish.      

126
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,784
     those get shiny swirls,    
         glossy ribbons,        

127
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,554
       or other trimmings       
while others are left untouched.

128
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:02,667
        the next machine        
 cuts the stickers into sheets. 

129
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,671
         then it's over         
     to a packaging machine     

130
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,041
     where an operator loads    
    the sheets into a hopper.   

131
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,346
   wheels with little grippers  
       collect the sheets       

132
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:19,016
  and drop them in piles of two 
       onto a backer car.       

133
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,621
the packaging machine then wraps
plastic film around the stickers

134
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,124
      and seals the package     
      with a static charge.     

135
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,534
      a hot knife then cuts     
   and seals it at both ends.   

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,175
 when it comes to other designs,
 there's no shortage of choices,

137
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,510
     giving sticker artists     
           of all ages          

138
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,748
         plenty of ways         
     to express themselves.     

139
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,532
            narrator:           
   early in the 20th century,   

140
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,869
   an american biscuit company  
  introduced a cookie sandwich. 

141
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,470
  it was two chocolate cookies  

142
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,806
     with rich vanilla icing    
         at the center.         

143
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,809
  this sandwich cookie created  
      an instant sensation,     

144
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,945
   and almost a century later,  
   it hasn't lost its appeal.   

145
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,283
 people still crave this sugary 
   fusion of crunch and cream.  

146
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,289
   dipping the sandwich cookie  
  in milk is a tasty tradition, 

147
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:36,194
     and whoever started it     
must have been one smart cookie.

148
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,301
     sandwich cookies start     
   with pure granulated sugar.  

149
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,037
  this worker heaves bags of it 
          into a mixer          

150
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,574
    as he prepares to whip up   
   the batter for the wafers.   

151
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,309
   he adds two kinds of cocoa.  

152
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,713
         the combination        
      will give the wafers      

153
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,415
  the desired taste and color.  

154
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,520
        a premix of salt        
 and other ingredients follows. 

155
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,590
     a specially formulated     
       canola-oil mixture       

156
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,126
         will transform         
      these dry ingredients     

157
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:12,464
  into a batter as huge beaters 
   blend everything together.   

158
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,466
         they add water,        

159
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,970
  and the batter starts to look 
 like a bubbling chocolate soup.

160
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,612
 they add dry ice, which chills 
  the batter as it evaporates.  

161
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,547
  the lower temperature is key  

162
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,017
  as they add flour to thicken  
    the batter into a dough.    

163
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:37,021
  the dough will turn out less  
 crumbly than it would have been

164
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,024
       if it had been kept      
      at room temperature.      

165
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,528
      a premix of leavening     
    ingredients goes in next.   

166
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,698
         one final mix,         

167
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,968
    and this chocolate dough    
         is ready to go.        

168
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,036
      the worker shovels it     
          onto a grate,         

169
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,438
   which protects his fingers   

170
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:57,175
     as he presses the dough    
  down into a molding machine.  

171
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,116
  this machine shapes the dough 
       into cookie wafers       

172
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,986
while pressing intricate designs
  and the brand name onto them. 

173
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:13,725
   it churns out an impressive  
 5,000 chocolate wafers an hour.

174
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,405
the freshly molded cookie wafers
            now move            

175
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,441
    from the silicon conveyer   
         to a steel one.        

176
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,747
       it takes the wafers      
        into a gas oven,        

177
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,082
        where they travel       
      in a continuous loop      

178
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,652
       for several minutes      
   to receive an even baking.   

179
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:49,928
after that, fans cool the wafers
   to the desired crispiness.   

180
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,299
 the chocolate wafers then move 
      to another conveyor,      

181
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,236
           which feeds          
    into a series of chutes.    

182
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,178
     then the wafers travel     
           over ramps           

183
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,481
   designed to make them fall   
    into a certain position.    

184
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,919
  one row lands plain-side up,  

185
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,989
       and the next lands       
   with the embossed side up.   

186
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,791
   this correctly orients them  

187
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,694
        to be sandwiched        
     around a cream filling.    

188
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,201
  it's a high-speed operation,  

189
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,804
 as a cylindrical pump deposits 
        the vanilla cream       

190
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,607
on the plain side of the wafers.

191
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,020
     the cream-coated wafers    
 head over to the next station. 

192
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,822
      here, machinery moves     
         the top wafers         

193
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,893
   onto the cream-coated ones.  

194
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,634
       the cookies move up      
         for the count.         

195
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,271
mechanical fingers separate them
       into bunches of 11.      

196
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,776
 then grippers swing into action

197
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,579
    to move each little bunch   
            forward.            

198
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,685
 they release the cookies neatly
       into plastic trays.      

199
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,129
            the trays           
    full of sandwich cookies    

200
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,032
move on to the wrapping station.

201
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,440
   here, metallic film unwinds  
   and wraps around the trays.  

202
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:51,816
    hot jaws move in to seal    
    the package at both ends.   

203
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,418
    finally, they're shipped    
          to retailers.         

204
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,688
 but once these sandwich cookies
       are in the pantry,       

205
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:01,092
        it might be tough       
    to keep them under wraps.   

206
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,640
 narrator: in moderate climates,
    tile roofs are the norm.    

207
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:19,177
 the tiles are typically rounded
    and terra-cotta in color,   

208
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,846
         characteristic         
  of mediterranean architecture 

209
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,714
  and made of clay or concrete. 

210
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,583
  today, concrete roofing tiles 

211
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,452
     come in a wide variety     
      of colors and styles      

212
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,422
        from traditional        
        to contemporary.        

213
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,994
  while concrete roofing tiles  

214
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,464
        can emulate wood        
      or asphalt shingles,      

215
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,666
     they have a far longer     
          life span --          

216
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,068
       more than 50 years.      

217
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,404
 the tile-making process begins 

218
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,740
        with smooth sand        
   from natural sand deposits   

219
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:54,145
combined with sharp, jagged sand
   made from pulverized rock.   

220
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,413
      the factory regrinds      

221
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,482
       any concrete tiles       
   that failed quality control  

222
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,952
    and adds them to the mix,   
            as well.            

223
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,424
       technicians analyze      
   the composition of the mix,  

224
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:10,027
      measure the moisture,     
  and assess the silt content.  

225
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,930
    too much silt will weaken   
          the concrete.         

226
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,303
  they measure silt by shaking  
    the sand in a test tube.    

227
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,174
    heavier particles settle    
to the bottom, water at the top,

228
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,975
      and silt in between.      

229
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,646
       the amount of silt       
      must not exceed 10%.      

230
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,186
    the sand mix runs through   
       a vibrating screen,      

231
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,390
which filters out large objects,
    such as rocks and sticks.   

232
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,862
        to make concrete,       
    you mix sand with cement.   

233
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,731
     the cement-truck driver    
         hooks up a hose        

234
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,369
      to blow its contents      
        into a huge silo.       

235
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,675
         from the silo,         
  the conveyor system metes out 

236
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,545
   a specific amount of cement  
         into the sand.         

237
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,616
          it's critical         
  to get the ratio just right.  

238
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,419
   roof tiles come in a choice  
           of colors.           

239
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,355
     they tint the concrete     
        a specific shade        

240
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:15,126
      by pumping in natural     
 iron-oxide pigments and water. 

241
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,968
 a cement screw mixes everything
   until it's evenly blended.   

242
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:29,974
    the concrete is now ready   
  to be molded into roof tiles. 

243
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,777
this machine sprays the aluminum
    molds with vegetable oil,   

244
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,582
     which will make it easy    
 to extract the finished tiles. 

245
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,786
       the concrete drops       
   into an extrusion machine,   

246
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,189
      which squeezes it out     
      in a continuous sheet     

247
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,258
     onto the passing molds.    

248
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,597
     knives descend, cutting    
   the sheet to tile lengths.   

249
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,667
    this is what the process    
   looks like in slow motion.   

250
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:01,539
  real-time production moves at 
 a rate of 110 tiles per minute.

251
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,645
 the tiles now run past rollers 
  that finish the edges nicely. 

252
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,419
     then an ink-jet printer    
   applies product information  

253
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,588
  along with the date and time. 

254
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,093
 the next stop is a giant oven. 

255
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,695
           the factory          
      meticulously controls     

256
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,297
         the temperature        
       and humidity inside      

257
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,501
   so that the concrete dries   
       and cures properly.      

258
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,505
 the tiles come out of the oven,
    depending on their size,    

259
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,074
      5 to 24 hours later.      

260
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,713
 an automated separator extracts
    each tile from its mold.    

261
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,583
     the conveyor then sends    
      the empty molds back      

262
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,219
         to be refilled         
       with wet concrete.       

263
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,990
      nozzles spray sealer      
   onto the top of the tiles.   

264
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,192
    this will force moisture    
           and calcium          

265
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,793
  to exit thorough the bottom,  

266
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,498
    preventing discoloration    
     on the tile's surface.     

267
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,604
workers do a final visual check,

268
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,575
       removing any tiles       
   with cracks or other flaws.  

269
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:20,217
   automated equipment stacks   
    and straps 36 to 39 tiles   

270
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,720
  into a group called a sleeve. 

271
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,960
      the factory subjects      
         random samples         

272
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,762
           to rigorous          
     quality-control testing    

273
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,765
         for strength...        

274
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,167
         permeability...        

275
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,971
          ...even hail.         

276
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:44,775
       to pass this test,       
 the tile must be left unscathed

277
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,980
   by a 2-inch ice ball flying  
     at 35 yards per second.    

278
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,449
  this fire-safety test ensures 

279
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,719
       that heat or flames      
    can't penetrate the tile.   

280
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,723
  roofs made of concrete tiles  

281
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,127
    can even withstand winds    
  of up to 150 miles per hour,  

282
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,231
        making them ideal       
for regions prone to hurricanes.

283
