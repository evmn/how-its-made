narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,492
hearing aids.

5
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:32,029
narrator: we're turning up
the volume for this one.

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,831
3-d puzzles --

7
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,502
a traditional pastime
enters a new dimension.

8
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,369
rubber mats --

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,307
we bring you
a step-by-step explanation.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,976
and toilets --

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,713
this fascinating report
leaves us flushed with pride.

12
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,921
when you stop and listen
to all the sounds around you,

13
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,524
you suddenly realize
how easy it is

14
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,558
to take your hearing
for granted.

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,195
if you ever develop
a hearing disorder,

16
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,196
you'll undoubtedly
feel the loss.

17
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,400
thankfully, though,
hearing aids are tinier

18
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,003
and more effective
than ever before.

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,475
loss of hearing
causes a serious handicap,

20
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,477
but, happily, it can be remedied
thanks to hearing aids.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,479
but before fabricating the aid,

22
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,349
the degree of hearing loss
must be precisely measured

23
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,352
with this apparatus
called an audiometer.

24
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,088
so they make a mold
of the ear canal.

25
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,293
to protect the eardrum,
an autoblock is inserted.

26
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,963
the next step is to pour in

27
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,165
a silicon
impression-making material.

28
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,368
it solidifies and is then
removed from the ear.

29
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,976
this congealed mass
representing the ear canal

30
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,481
is then soaked in warm wax
to obtain a positive imprint.

31
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,660
then the silicon container
is filled.

32
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:13,531
the silicon hardens
in only 10 minutes.

33
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,000
the hardened silicon block
is removed,

34
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,669
and the excess of the imprint
is trimmed away

35
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:21,872
so that only the essential part
is retained.

36
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,541
the imprint must slip easily
into the ear.

37
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,278
it's now the molding stage
for the hearing aid.

38
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,547
acrylic is poured into the mold

39
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,683
before placing it
into this ultraviolet oven.

40
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,420
without emitting any heat,
this oven hardens the acrylic.

41
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,623
here is the raw prosthesis

42
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,025
without its electronic
components.

43
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,896
this plan details the electric
circuit of the amplifier.

44
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,901
holes are pierced
for the volume control.

45
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,503
these components are tiny.

46
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,639
here is the volume control...

47
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,045
...the miniature microphone
that captures sounds...

48
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:05,383
and the earphone,
which functions as a speaker.

49
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,919
this tiny braided wire
of seven conductors

50
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,587
is soldered to the amplifier

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,124
and other parts
of the prosthesis with pewter.

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,863
the hybrid circuit is inserted
into a silicon casing,

53
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,265
which assures its protection.

54
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,605
then the wires are soldered
to the speaker.

55
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,277
and they verify
the proper functioning

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,613
of the volume control.

57
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,949
a hearing aid
must be very discreet.

58
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:41,152
that's why they cut the excess
with a diamond disk.

59
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:45,690
they also remove the roughness
with fine sandpaper.

60
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,226
the holes we see here are used
to vent air from the earphone.

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,697
this silicone tube
is used to make the vent.

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,234
acrylic is poured onto the tube
to form a tunnel.

63
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:02,106
ultraviolet light is used
to harden the acrylic.

64
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,709
afterwards, the tube is removed.

65
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,981
this hole is used
to position the fastener,

66
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,117
a small wire which allows
for removing the hearing aid

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,319
from the ear.

68
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,993
then the battery is installed.

69
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,528
only a few parts,
such as the microphone,

70
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,864
remain to be put in place.

71
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,400
then everything
is delicately assembled

72
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,969
into the interior
of the prosthesis.

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,478
the two parts of the hearing aid
are then glued together.

74
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,847
ultraviolet hardens the glue.

75
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,220
the plate used to position
the prosthesis components

76
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,355
is cut away with the drill.

77
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,890
then the hearing aid
is manually polished

78
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,794
to make it perfectly smooth
and comfortable.

79
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,972
the prosthesis is now completed.

80
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,308
there remains
one important step --

81
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,711
verifying its electroacoustic
characteristic.

82
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,380
it's with this analyzer
that they validate

83
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,617
that the hearing aid conforms
to the original prescription.

84
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,726
these minute prostheses

85
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,529
allow us to solve
the main hearing problems.

86
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,731
microfabrication
of a single unit

87
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,168
requires a little more
than two days of work.

88
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,081
narrator: remember spending
lazy afternoons

89
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,418
putting together simple
60-piece jigsaw puzzles?

90
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,887
well, put that image
out of your mind,

91
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,490
because today's
sophisticated puzzles

92
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,159
can have 1,500 3-d pieces

93
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:06,163
that go up, down,
and even sideways.

94
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,998
are you up for the challenge?

95
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,705
flat puzzles are well known
by everyone,

96
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,708
but 3-d puzzles present
a different challenge.

97
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,977
these 3-dimensional puzzles

98
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,047
are first conceived
with computer software.

99
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,587
good blades are needed
to cut puzzle pieces.

100
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,922
here are the blades
for the master die

101
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,059
which will cut out printed
sheets of different models.

102
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,332
this rubber will be used
to eject the die.

103
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,336
the master cutting die
is unique to each puzzle.

104
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,906
it is the specific pattern
used to make the puzzle.

105
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,016
they measure it meticulously
to obtain a perfect register.

106
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,954
it's imperative that the die
not move during the cutting,

107
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,823
otherwise the pieces would be
cut at the wrong points,

108
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,428
so they very firmly
secure it in place.

109
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,179
the carbon of the die
is positioned.

110
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,448
it's somewhat like
printing the master.

111
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,516
alignment is again verified,

112
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,117
a highly important step

113
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,421
which assures the quality
of the final product.

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,259
finally, they install
this large metallic plate,

115
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,794
which is the cutting base.

116
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,331
it will be on this surface
that the master die will strike.

117
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,199
once measurements are finished,

118
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,436
the drawer of the die
is slid into place.

119
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,948
this press cuts the pattern
seen on the puzzle.

120
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,683
here's how it works.

121
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,417
the sheets,
or printed cardboards,

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,220
go into the drawer one by one,

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,256
where they are cut according
to the master model.

124
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:22,867
we clearly see the press making
the cut in the puzzle sheet.

125
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,140
the cut sheets
pile up on one another.

126
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,915
at this checkpoint, they verify
the precision of the cut.

127
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,519
they make sure that every piece
is correctly shaped.

128
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,526
now they go to the foam support
of the puzzle.

129
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,262
this guillotine is used
to cut the polyethylene sheets

130
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,666
onto which they will glue
the cut images.

131
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,674
foam sheets are inserted
into this laminator

132
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,410
heated to 450 degrees.

133
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,813
the sheet with the design on it
is glued onto the foam

134
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,083
with a thermosetting adhesive.

135
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,554
now they glue the printed sheet
onto the foam sheet.

136
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,028
once the adhesion is finished,

137
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,696
the puzzles are stacked
on one another,

138
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,899
and they proceed
to the unbuckling operation.

139
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,603
by pulling, they remove
the surplus cuttings.

140
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,845
the same design is printed
several times on a sheet,

141
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,047
so they must separate
each puzzle.

142
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,451
this step is called
the reduction of the models.

143
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,993
now the pieces
have to be separated.

144
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,195
this decorticator
handles this task

145
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,798
and sends the pieces
down a chute.

146
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,873
packing cartons arrive
already made up,

147
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,943
and the puzzle pieces
are placed in their boxes.

148
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,347
no less than 15,000 puzzles
are produced here each day.

149
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,349
since it began operations,

150
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,552
the company has created more
than 300 different puzzle models

151
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,690
from quite simple ones
to much more complex designs.

152
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,758
the largest of them
contain a total

153
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:33,163
of more than 3,000 pieces.

154
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,433
and you need real patience
for this one.

155
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,309
narrator:
ever wonder what happens

156
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,445
to the millions of used tires
we throw out every year?

157
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,180
well, you'll be relieved to know

158
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,383
that burning tires
is a thing of the past.

159
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,654
today's tires are often given
new life as rubber mats.

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,857
some are even big enough
to cover whole arenas.

161
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,594
now, that's recycling.

162
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,405
used tires are a real source
of pollution.

163
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,474
this pile represents
about 100,000 of them.

164
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,410
at any rate, these tires
will have a second life.

165
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,879
they'll be recycled
to make rubber mats.

166
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,615
each day in this factory,

167
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:28,218
they recycle 15,000 tires
into mats.

168
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,288
tires have to be reduced
to little granules,

169
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,025
but first this conveyor feeds
the tires into the washer.

170
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,226
tires are washed

171
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,029
with a water-based
biodegradable preparation.

172
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,531
then they're sent
to the shredder.

173
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,702
the shredder has two rows
of large teeth.

174
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,572
these grind up the tires
into pieces.

175
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,449
this shredder is able to cut up
almost 1,000 tires an hour.

176
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,585
they come out as fairly
good-sized pieces of tires,

177
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,987
which are then shredded
a second time.

178
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,730
metal is magnetically separated
from the rubber,

179
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,166
and the metal pieces
are recycled at another factory.

180
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,075
other components of the tires,
such as fiberglass and nylon,

181
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,010
also have to be separated.

182
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,380
they use a sifter to get out
unwanted rubbish.

183
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:36,220
recuperated rubber particles
purged of foreign materials

184
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,888
measure about 1/10 of an inch.

185
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,625
some 16 tons of tire particles

186
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,428
are piled up
in this recycling depot.

187
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,235
but the particles are still
too large to be used.

188
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,237
they're sent to a secondary
shredder supply tank,

189
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,774
where they'll be reduced
even further.

190
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,313
this tractor feeds
the secondary shredder.

191
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,450
grinding action produces
a kind of rubber powder.

192
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,861
the powder is spread out
on these enormous molds.

193
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,263
this mold has a length
of 23 feet

194
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,932
and a width of 4 feet.

195
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,202
thickness varies according
to the product being made.

196
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,270
the molds filled
with rubber powder

197
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,940
are stored in this loading
magazine of the press.

198
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,777
once full, the molds are sent
to the rubber-mat press.

199
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,349
here's the mat press.

200
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,219
the powder has to be cooked
at a very high temperature

201
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,954
for about 30 minutes.

202
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,790
cooking time depends
on the product being made.

203
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:51,261
the cooked mat goes
to the unmolding unit

204
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,430
before being sent off to cool.

205
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,035
the rubber mats
are still extremely hot.

206
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,170
they're cooled
with jets of water

207
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,105
for a period of several minutes.

208
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:14,318
the cooled mats can now be sent
to the next department.

209
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,986
this conveyor
in the cutting center

210
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,055
positions the mat
before it's cut.

211
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,892
the mat is vibrated
to eliminate any surplus water.

212
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,200
each rubber mat is now cut up
into three pieces.

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,543
the cut mats are then
stacked into a pile

214
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,879
and stored before being shipped.

215
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,488
the company
also makes mudguards.

216
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,158
these are fabricated the same
way as the preceding mats.

217
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,293
after having been cooled
in water,

218
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,496
but while they're still warm,
they remove the surplus rubber.

219
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,267
this operation
is called "notching."

220
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,910
hard rubber rings are also
produced at this facility

221
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,779
with the same
fabrication methods

222
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:19,315
and, as always,
from old, used tires.

223
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,184
over a 12-hour period,

224
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,655
this facility makes no less
than 12,000 rubber mats

225
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:27,056
from old, recycled tires.

226
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,228
this translates into good news
for our environment.

227
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,605
narrator:
we tend not to put much thought

228
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,474
into this humblest
of household appliances

229
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,544
as long as it keeps doing
what it was built to do.

230
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,946
but like most of the machines
we've invented

231
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,481
to do our dirty work,

232
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,149
we may take it for granted,

233
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,754
but it's next to impossible to
imagine life without the toilet.

234
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,498
the first public restrooms
appeared in ancient rome

235
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,835
when the emperor vespasian
built latrines.

236
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,369
such public urinals

237
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:18,108
became widely known
as vespasiennes by 1840.

238
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,646
in 1775, the invention
of a water-flush system

239
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,450
created toilets somewhat
resembling today's convenience.

240
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,986
the valve and siphon
were added in 1784

241
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,856
and the septic tank in 1896.

242
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,600
a toilet is an everyday object

243
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,803
whose fabrication requires
several days of work.

244
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,540
it involves assembling
several molds called "tools."

245
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,877
each new product requires the
design of a master plaster mold

246
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,948
from which they will produce
a plastic tool.

247
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,289
this latter will be used
to create plaster duplicates

248
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,992
used as production molds.

249
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,433
the plaster production mold
of a toilet

250
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,103
is made from six different tools
which have to be assembled.

251
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,772
their life-span
is only two months.

252
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,842
the process begins with
a mixture of water and plaster

253
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,044
according to a precise recipe.

254
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,915
then the liquid is poured into
this filling hole of the tool.

255
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,984
once the plaster hardens,
they can proceed with unmolding.

256
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,586
they strike the end

257
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,122
at the junction
of the plaster mold and the tool

258
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,726
with a rubber hammer
so as not to damage the plaster.

259
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,336
pieces are gently assembled.

260
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,939
the toilet softly
takes its shape.

261
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,010
it is in this same mold that
they will later color the clay.

262
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,419
then they install
tensioning straps.

263
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,622
little blocks are inserted
between the mold and the strap

264
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,924
to increase the tension.

265
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,292
the mold will soon be
filled with liquid,

266
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,162
and they thus prevent
any distortion.

267
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,964
here a new recipe
is being prepared.

268
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,501
this time it's a slurry,
a composite of clay and silica.

269
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,772
this preparation
is spread out over 48 hours.

270
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,308
now they install the core,
the upper part of the mold.

271
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,711
they can now proceed
with the filling.

272
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,181
this copper distribution pipe

273
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,383
connected to the tank
containing the slurry

274
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,453
permits the filling
of several molds at a time.

275
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,823
they need about 45 pounds
of the mix per bowl mold.

276
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,261
after an hour,

277
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,898
the slurry has attained
a thickness of 4/10 of an inch.

278
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,935
the plug is pulled to allow
the excess slurry to run out.

279
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,339
they can now unmold
the still-fragile piece.

280
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,340
this thicker slurry is used

281
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,310
to adhere
these two pieces together.

282
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,090
they cut the holes
and unmold the ensemble.

283
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,727
the toilet is now molded.

284
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,633
then, to obtain
a perfect appearance,

285
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,300
they remove the little fillet

286
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,337
formed by the surplus
adhesive slurry.

287
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,244
the toilets air-dry
for 36 hours,

288
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,582
then in a warm-air dryer
for 12 hours.

289
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,784
finishing must be impeccable.

290
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,254
they carefully sand the surface
to make it perfectly smooth.

291
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,190
a vacuum draws up the dust.

292
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,059
then, with a jet
of compressed air,

293
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,496
dust and debris are blown away.

294
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,501
bowls are hand-painted
in a special room.

295
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,808
as for the water tanks,

296
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,277
they are painted
by an automated robot.

297
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,357
this truck
carries the different parts

298
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,228
to the final
fabrication stage -- baking.

299
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,631
the toilets remain in this oven

300
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,835
at the very high temperature
of 2,150 degrees

301
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,103
for 23 hours.

302
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:44,040
it takes this long to fuse
the clay and silicone.

303
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,910
the paint then becomes
hard and shiny,

304
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,845
and it's all done.

305
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,250
the toilets
and the different bowls

306
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,052
now take on shapes more elegant
than in the past,

307
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,388
but the fabrication
of each one of them

308
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,924
will have the same basic
construction steps

309
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,726
involving 45 pounds of slurry

310
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,396
and almost 4 days of labor.

311
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,204
