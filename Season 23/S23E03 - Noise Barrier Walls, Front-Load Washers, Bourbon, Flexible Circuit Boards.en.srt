      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,121
      narrator: to contain      
     the sounds of traffic,     

4
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:58,591
      it's often necessary      
  to put up a wall of silence.  

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,994
       noise-barrier walls      
    both absorb traffic noise   

6
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,530
    and shield neighborhoods    
            from it.            

7
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,733
    with stone or brick-like    
     textures on both sides,    

8
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,403
       they even look good      
         on the street.         

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,075
          in the 1970s,         

10
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,678
       noise-barrier walls      
   were mainly drab concrete.   

11
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:21,414
     fast forward to today,     

12
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,483
  and the walls come in a range 
     of textures and designs    

13
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,619
        for curb appeal.        

14
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,221
       but of course, it's      
 their noise-absorbing qualities

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,291
       that really improve      
        the neighborhood.       

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,692
they're made from a wood shaving

17
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:36,028
       and cement material      
       that's very porous,      

18
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,698
     which allows the walls     
 to absorb sound and entrap it. 

19
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,435
        production starts       
     with the raw shavings.     

20
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:46,439
    a conveyor delivers them    
        to a hammer mill.       

21
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,508
    inside, rotating hammers    
     force the wood shavings    

22
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,777
    through a cutting screen.   

23
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,452
        this carves them        
     into smaller particles     

24
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,321
        of various sizes.       

25
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,922
 it's this combination of sizes 

26
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,658
        that will create        
    the noise-absorbing pores   

27
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,427
     in the completed wall.     

28
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,066
            they test           
a proprietary chemical solution,

29
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,335
        that will be used       
  to treat the wood particles,  

30
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:19,872
           and confirm          
  it's the right concentration. 

31
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,941
     an auger then mixes it     
     into the wood particles    

32
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,811
       until they're damp       
     and thoroughly coated.     

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,212
     without this treatment,    

34
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,483
       the wood particles       
   wouldn't bind with cement.   

35
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,419
  it will also protect the wood 
           from decay.          

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,824
in another mixer, they add water
 and a second chemical solution 

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,328
       to further enhance       
      the binding process.      

38
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,702
   the wood particles are now   
  primed and ready to be mixed  

39
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:56,308
with a powdered mix of limestone
  clay called portland cement.  

40
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,044
           the machine          
      works the ingredients     

41
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,379
         until they form        
       a cohesive material      

42
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,114
       that can be shaped.      

43
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,722
         the next worker        
     sprays a release agent     

44
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,892
  onto the stone-pattern liner. 

45
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:19,398
       each mold will form      
    one noise barrier panel.    

46
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,000
       the team transfers       
    the wood-and-cement blend   

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,602
         into the mold.         

48
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,070
   they work at a steady pace   

49
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,207
  to fill it before the mixture 
         begins to dry.         

50
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,080
 once they've filled it partway,

51
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,450
           they level           
   the wood-cement material...  

52
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:42,054
       ...then compact it       
      with a tamping tool.      

53
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:46,425
  next, they add a steel mesh.  

54
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,560
      this mesh will serve      
         as a skeleton,         

55
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,897
        allowing the wall       
        to stand strong.        

56
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,434
they pour freshly mixed concrete
      onto the steel mesh.      

57
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,035
    it flows through the mesh   

58
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,772
  and onto the sound-absorbing  
         mixture below,         

59
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,441
binding the two layers together.

60
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,678
 the worker spreads the concrete
      throughout the mold.      

61
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,849
     he pierces the surface     
     with a vibrating tool.     

62
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,452
         the vibrations         
    consolidate the concrete    

63
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,721
   and eliminate air pockets.   

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,057
   the two-person team levels   

65
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,161
       the concrete layer       
      using a wood screed.      

66
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:35,140
    they apply a second layer   
 of the noise-absorbing material

67
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,076
          and level it.         

68
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,621
           they lower           
  the stone-pattern press lid,  

69
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,957
   which will mold the pattern  
 onto the top side of the panel.

70
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,429
they set a 10-ton concrete block
          on the mold,          

71
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,365
       and pressure forces      
        the mold patterns       

72
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,634
 onto both sides of the casting.

73
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,772
      after a few minutes,      

74
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:11,409
      they remove the lid,      
  and the imprint is revealed.  

75
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,579
  they quickly cover the panel  
  surface with a plastic sheet  

76
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,982
   to prevent any evaporation   
           of moisture          

77
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,184
     as the cure continues.     

78
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,120
 if the blend cures too quickly,

79
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,455
         it could crack.        

80
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,791
       after another day,       
      they remove the tarp      

81
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,961
  and they're ready to extract  
    the panel from the mold.    

82
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,131
     a crane lifts the panel    

83
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,134
        and sets it aside       
   to cure for about a month.   

84
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,139
      built panel by panel,     

85
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:45,010
  these noise-barrier walls can 
 become a substantial fortress, 

86
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,714
    providing a solid defense   
    against noise pollution.    

87
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,099
            narrator:           
 front-loading washing machines 

88
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,968
       use far less water       
     than standard washers.     

89
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,838
   they're gentler on clothes   
   because there's no agitator  

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,040
   in the middle of the drum.   

91
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,575
    the spin speed is usually   

92
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,979
  about 20 percent faster than  
 the standard top-load machine, 

93
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,882
         so the clothes         
   come out of the wash drier.  

94
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:30,055
   with gravity helping tumble  
the laundry, a front-load washer

95
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:34,059
    is gentler on the clothes   
     while using less water.    

96
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,730
 its design can also accommodate
     a larger-capacity drum,    

97
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,999
   so you can do bigger loads.  

98
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,601
      the washer's cabinet      
        is made of steel.       

99
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,938
 a washing machine is routinely 
      exposed to moisture,      

100
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:50,276
  so they use galvanized steel, 
       which doesn't rust.      

101
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:53,479
  the cabinet base is comprised 
         of four pieces,        

102
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,281
        which, together,        
provide more structural strength

103
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,882
   than a single piece would.   

104
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:01,553
 at the corners, workers install
    four screw-in rubber feet   

105
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,221
  which are height-adjustable.  

106
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,625
     this allows the washer     
  to level on an uneven floor.  

107
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,894
  next are the two side panels. 

108
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,031
    they are already stamped    
to the required shape in a press

109
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,332
 and coated with baked-on paint.

110
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,836
 this automated machine installs
   brackets on the inner side   

111
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:18,837
     for mounting components    

112
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,372
            later on.           

113
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,108
   the next automated machine   
    attaches the side panels    

114
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,777
         to the cabinet.        

115
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,445
 rather than welding the edges, 

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,314
        which would ruin        
        the paint finish,       

117
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,648
    the machine's punch tools   

118
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,584
          mechanically          
     lock them to the base.     

119
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,056
   a robot then transfers the   
  cabinet to the assembly line. 

120
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,191
          here, workers         
     connect the side panels    

121
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,028
    with a structural support   
     bracket and power cord,    

122
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,930
    already installed on it.    

123
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,531
workers prepare the rear portion

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,201
        of the machine's        
     two-piece plastic tub.     

125
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:53,138
      first, a robot mounts     
   a steel bearing on a press.  

126
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,806
         the press then         
       forces the bearing       

127
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,410
    into a hole at the bottom   
    of the inside of the tub.   

128
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:02,547
  then the process is repeated  
 but on the outside of the tub. 

129
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,683
      this pair of bearings     
seals the hole to prevent leaks,

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,388
 and enables the stainless-steel
       wash drum to spin.       

131
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,625
        to counterbalance       
       the spinning load,       

132
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,494
      they weight the front     
of the drum with a plastic ring,

133
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,799
  containing heavy steel balls  
       suspended in fluid.      

134
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,302
   then, they insert the shaft  
     at the base of the drum    

135
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,037
     into the tub's bearings    

136
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,572
  and cover the top of the drum 
     with the front section     

137
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,840
           of the tub.          

138
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,643
     it has a rubber gasket     
        called a bellow.        

139
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:35,847
  the bellow forms a leak-proof 
      seal around the drum.     

140
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,183
 after welding the tub sections 
            together,           

141
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,919
  they mount the washer's motor 
          to the rear.          

142
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:44,589
   in this stator-rotor motor,  
  the electric current travels  

143
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,526
 through the coiled copper wires
     of the motor's stator,     

144
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,662
        generating pulses       
         of electricity.        

145
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:54,199
  those pulses push on magnets  
    lining the motor's rotor,   

146
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,268
       positioned on top.       

147
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,337
  the magnets repel the pulses, 

148
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,072
        and this repeated       
         pulse repelling        

149
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:04,543
drives the drum in the direction
       and speed required.      

150
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,814
 next, they install a drain hose
     on the side of the tub     

151
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,250
          and attach it         
      with a retainer clip.     

152
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,755
they bolt a piece of concrete to
 either side of the drum opening

153
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,225
  to counterbalance the weight  
    of the motor on the back.   

154
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,695
then, they turn the now-complete
      wash unit on its side     

155
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,964
 and install it in the cabinet. 

156
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,838
 next, they mount the drain pump
       in the cabinet base      

157
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,773
     and connect its wiring.    

158
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:39,111
   the pump's job is to remove  
    dirty water from the tub.   

159
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,981
      four shock absorbers      
          are installed         

160
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,785
       between the bottom       
 of the wash unit and the base. 

161
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:49,655
   these large pistons dampen   
      much of the vibration     

162
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,191
during the wash and spin cycles.

163
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,193
     next, the front panel.     

164
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,729
         like the sides,        
  it's made of a stamped sheet  

165
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,066
       of galvanized steel      
  with a baked-on paint finish. 

166
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,469
    they install and connect    
          the console,          

167
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:07,506
   which houses the machine's   
     central control module.    

168
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,678
they pull the bellow on the drum
  all around the front opening  

169
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,547
     to seal the perimeter.     

170
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:23,388
     they secure it in place    
   with a wire retainer clip.   

171
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,630
       the hinged door has      
  a see-through plastic window. 

172
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,966
          like the rest         
  of the machine's metal parts, 

173
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,702
         the door panel         
    and hardware attaching it   

174
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:40,371
          are also made         
      of galvanized steel.      

175
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,841
         the back panel         
       is left unpainted.       

176
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,310
  after feeding the power cord  
        through its hole,       

177
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,314
     workers screw the panel    
   to the rest of the cabinet.  

178
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,116
 then, they complete the cabinet
       with the top panel,      

179
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,620
  which has the baked-on paint  
             finish.            

180
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,856
 the front-load washing machine 

181
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,060
         is now all set         
  and ready for its first load. 

182
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,675
    narrator: bourbon whiskey   
      is uniquely american.     

183
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,411
        the u.s. congress       
    officially recognized it    

184
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,479
          as a product          
     distinct to the nation.    

185
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,882
      this amber-hued brew      
       was first cooked up      

186
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,486
 by scottish and irish settlers 
 in late 18th century kentucky. 

187
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,755
             today,             
   production continues there   

188
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,958
 with the approval of congress. 

189
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,297
     the american government    
 regulates the making of bourbon

190
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,900
   to keep this native spirit   
       true to tradition.       

191
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,768
     by law, it must be made    

192
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:47,839
        from a grain mix        
    that's at least 51% corn.   

193
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,776
           distillers           
   often use more for flavor.   

194
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:55,113
      shakers sift out cobs     
   or other foreign material,   

195
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:58,450
         and the kernels        
      head into a grinder.      

196
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,119
             inside,            
    rollers crush the kernels   

197
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,722
           to release           
    the flavor of the starch.   

198
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,859
the process leaves larger chunks
   of the corn germ and husks.  

199
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,063
         once distilled,        
   these bits will settle out.  

200
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,933
in separate batches, the machine

201
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:19,738
    also grinds malted barley   
   and soft red winter wheat.   

202
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,808
 they cook the corn and blend it

203
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,811
      with limestone-rich,      
    iron-free kentucky water.   

204
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,081
      they add the barley,      
          winter wheat,         

205
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,084
        and a bit of mash       
     from a previous batch.     

206
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,289
   along with a special yeast   
   formulation, the grain mash  

207
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,626
  flows into fermentation tanks 
      made of cypress wood.     

208
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:46,698
      after 8 to 10 hours,      
    the yeast works its magic   

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,968
          and the mash          
    becomes a bubbling brew.    

210
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,438
     the bubbling is caused     

211
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,974
         by the release         
      of carbon-dioxide gas     

212
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,978
   as the grain sugars ferment  
       and become alcohol.      

213
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,313
        after three days,       

214
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,181
        it has fermented        
       into a thick liquid      

215
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,450
  they call 'distiller's beer." 

216
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,189
they pump it into a column still
  which boils off the alcohol,  

217
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:14,392
          leaving water         
  and other substances behind.  

218
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,863
  the alcoholic vapor rises up  
  to be condensed into liquid.  

219
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,932
       after distilling it      
         a second time,         

220
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:25,704
    the alcohol concentration   
  rises to a strong 130 proof.  

221
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:32,077
           it's clear,          
    with no noticeable color.   

222
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,646
         at this stage,         
    they call it "white dog."   

223
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,216
    once water has been added   
      to dilute the whiskey     

224
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,218
          to 110 proof,         

225
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,889
   an employee takes a sample   
    and sends it to the lab.    

226
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,293
   there, a technician places   
   a test tube of the alcohol   

227
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,296
into a gas chromatograph tester.

228
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,767
    it vaporizes the alcohol    

229
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,905
  and then analyzes the flavor  
 compounds and alcohol strength.

230
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,708
   with approval from the lab,  

231
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:07,045
          they're ready         
      to barrel the batch.      

232
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,047
   they pump it out of storage  
 tanks and into new oak barrels 

233
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:14,519
that have been purposely charred
         on the inside.         

234
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,589
      charring caramelizes      
 naturally occurring wood sugars

235
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,993
        to add sweetness        
   to the alcohol as it ages.   

236
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,697
   it will also turn the clear  
     alcohol an amber color.    

237
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,670
           once corked          
     with a walnut stopper,     

238
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:36,875
  the employee rolls the barrel 
 into a multi-tiered warehouse. 

239
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,878
        here, the bourbon       
    will age for many years.    

240
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,279
        partway through,        

241
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,415
     they'll move the barrel    
to another level of the building

242
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,017
 due to temperature variations. 

243
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,754
   this will make the product   
        more consistent.        

244
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,956
    after six to seven years,   

245
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,093
     they uncork the stopper    
     and insert steel tubes     

246
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,329
     to draw in ambient air.    

247
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,033
     this causes the bourbon    
   to flow freely when tipped,  

248
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,036
  and it gushes into a trough.  

249
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:09,307
     the alcohol has ripened    
to a sweet caramel-colored brew.

250
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,980
    after they add more water   
      to make it 90 proof,      

251
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,449
    it's ready for bottling.    

252
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,986
    nozzles fill the bottles    
 with bourbon right to the neck.

253
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:28,527
     the bottles then circle    
  over to the cap applicators.  

254
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:33,231
the applicators spin metal caps,
 screwing them onto the bottles.

255
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,935
the bottles then ride a carousel

256
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,538
          and a device          
picks up and applies the labels.

257
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:43,542
      a brush smoothes them     
         to the bottles.        

258
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,213
down the line, a two-person team

259
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:53,084
      retrieves the bottles     
  and dips the caps in hot wax. 

260
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,287
    the wax quickly dries and   
 solidifies to give the bourbon 

261
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,190
         a better seal.         

262
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,361
       after several years      
       in the distillery,       

263
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:06,631
      this kentucky bourbon     
        has come of age,        

264
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,134
   and that calls for a toast.  

265
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,319
   narrator: the circuit board  

266
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,454
     is where the electronic    
     components are located,    

267
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,389
    along with the electrical   
  connections which power them. 

268
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,858
       in a larger device,      
       such as a computer,      

269
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,860
        the circuit board       
       is typically rigid.      

270
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,596
   when the device is compact,  
      like a small camera,      

271
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,932
        the circuit board       
        must be flexible.       

272
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,502
 it needs to fold to fit inside.

273
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,073
     flexible circuit boards    
    are so thin and pliable,    

274
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,542
        they're nicknamed       
       origami circuitry,       

275
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:54,078
     after the japanese art     
        of paper folding.       

276
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,749
    at the core of the boards   
   is a hair-thin polymer film  

277
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,218
      that's both bendable      
       and heat resistant.      

278
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,489
 the manufacturer produces this 
material for several industries.

279
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,691
          in this case,         
      they cut rolls of it      

280
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,362
to the width required for making
    flexible circuit boards.    

281
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:16,434
   with a rigid sheet of paper  
lending support from underneath,

282
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,969
    the film enters a machine   

283
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,305
   which sandwiches it between  
   two thin sheets of copper.   

284
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,174
          a cutter then         
       slices the sandwich      

285
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,377
    into rectangular sheets.    

286
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,679
        a cushion of air        
pumped through the conveyor belt

287
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:30,982
     literally floats sheet     
   after sheet off the machine  

288
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,185
        and into a stack.       

289
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,854
     each three-layer sheet     
   is separated from the next   

290
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:40,592
      by the support paper      
       called a laminate.       

291
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,262
  the film at the center has a  
heat-activated adhesive coating,

292
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,331
       while the adjoining      
         copper surfaces        

293
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,868
 have been chemically roughened 
      to enhance adhesion.      

294
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,271
    after drawing the layers    
 tightly together with a vacuum,

295
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,805
   workers place the laminates  

296
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,208
     in a high-temperature,     
      high-pressure chamber     

297
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,010
       for several hours.       

298
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,948
  this activates the adhesive,  
       bonding the layers.      

299
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,815
   to test the bond strength,   

300
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:08,152
   they burn some adhesive off  
  a sample of finished laminate 

301
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,155
 to pry apart the layered edge. 

302
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,759
 then, they grab the top copper 
 layer with this pulling device 

303
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,761
    and measure the strength    
        required to peel        

304
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,697
        it off the film.        

305
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,966
   the laminate's now shipped   
   to a circuit board factory.  

306
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,835
 here, computer-guided machines 

307
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,104
            cut them            
   into specific-sized panels   

308
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,839
      and drill tiny holes      
          for mounting          

309
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,841
   the electronic components.   

310
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,510
     then a coating machine     

311
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,246
       uses a combination       
      of heat and pressure      

312
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,116
to apply a light-sensitive fluid
     to the panel's surface.    

313
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,520
   technicians load the panel   
    into an exposure machine,   

314
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:46,124
in which a computer-guided laser
   scans the circuitry pattern  

315
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,859
     onto the coded surface.    

316
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:50,328
        a laser is a beam       
        of focused light,       

317
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,732
      so wherever it hits,      
  the fluid reacts and hardens. 

318
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:59,070
         the dark areas         
 of unexposed fluid remain soft.

319
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,540
        the next machine        
   acid-washes the soft areas,  

320
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,142
     removing both the fluid    

321
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,077
      and the copper layer      
         underneath it.         

322
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,614
  now the only copper remaining 
   on top of the polymer film   

323
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,083
  is in the circuitry pattern.  

324
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,418
     this inspection device     

325
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:17,322
       meticulously checks      
  every single copper circuit.  

326
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,227
 next, they remove surface dust 
      with a sticky roller.     

327
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,828
   the panel must be pristine   

328
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,698
   before receiving the sheet   
    of electrical insulation,   

329
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,436
   a mere .25 of a millimeter   
             thick.             

330
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,371
   technicians use a magnifier  

331
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,040
      to carefully match up     
   alignment holes on the film  

332
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,110
       with corresponding       
  alignment holes on the panel. 

333
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,579
          by activating         
  the film's built-in adhesive  

334
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,114
     with a soldering iron,     

335
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,786
    they tack the insulation    
   to the panel at key spots.   

336
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,321
    the next step is to fully   
     laminate the insulation    

337
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,589
          to the panel.         

338
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,391
 technicians sandwich two panels

339
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,728
    at a time between sheets    
     of protective plastic.     

340
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,263
   this protects the surfaces   
    from the heat and weight    

341
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,599
    of the lamination press.    

342
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,936
as it forces the insulation film
    deep down onto the panel,   

343
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,272
 it encapsulates the circuitry. 

344
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,808
      they load the panels      
   into the lamination press,   

345
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:14,279
    apply a vacuum to remove    
   the air between the layers   

346
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,413
        and start her up.       

347
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,483
  for the next hour and a half, 

348
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,686
    the press simultaneously    
      applies high pressure     

349
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:26,024
    while heating the panels    
   to 400 degrees fahrenheit.   

350
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,226
      when the panels cool      
   and come out of the press,   

351
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:34,465
 technicians place one at a time
 on a circuit board-shaped dye. 

352
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,167
    then they release a press   

353
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,903
     which forces the panel     
       onto the sharp dye,      

354
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,240
          slicing away          
      the excess material.      

355
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,176
   the flexible circuit board   
  is now ready for the company  

356
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:48,012
          that installs         
   the electronic components.   

357
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,851
       there are two ways       
     to mount components --     

358
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,654
      solder them directly      
    onto the board's surface    

359
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,323
      or solder tiny prongs     

360
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,525
   underneath the components,   
         known as leads,        

361
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,993
into the board's mounting holes.

362
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,395
    a flexible circuit board    

363
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,064
         can have as few        
      as a dozen components     

364
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,868
       or as many as 500.       

365
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,068
     technicians can solder     

366
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:14,739
           larger ones          
  magnified under a microscope, 

367
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,808
         but only robots        
     can solder smaller ones    

368
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,477
     because they're so tiny    

369
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,247
       and barely visible       
        to the human eye.
