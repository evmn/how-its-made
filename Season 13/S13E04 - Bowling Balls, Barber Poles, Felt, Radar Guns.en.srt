narrator: the bowling bowl has undergone 

4
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,855
a lot of changes over several centuries     

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,325
to become such a striking success.    

6
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,793
from a crude stone to carved wood         

7
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,996
to rubber to molded polyester, 

8
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,599
it's been reinvented numerous times.        

9
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:11,003
but the latest version has turned out to be a real winner.

10
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,409
technological advances     

11
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,679
have reshaped the bowling ball at its very core.       

12
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,349
no longer round, the nucleus is asymmetrical,  

13
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:26,285
which causes the ball to curve towards the pins   

14
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,387
as it rolls down the lane.   

15
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,225
they make the cores from polyester resin,     

16
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,562
blending in minerals like barites, silica powder,  

17
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,930
and limestone.         

18
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,103
the result looks like chocolate milk,      

19
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,773
or make that hot chocolate, because a catalyst       

20
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,110
triggers a chemical reaction that heats it up.       

21
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,780
as they pipe it into the molds,

22
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,716
it quickly starts to cure and solidify.         

23
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,321
in just two minutes, it's ready to extract.     

24
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:06,926
this core is oblong -- flat on one side with a knob. 

25
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,065
there are different versions of this core design,      

26
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,667
each one carefully calculated 

27
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,670
to manipulate the bowling ball's performance 

28
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,905
at a specific skill level.   

29
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:27,012
they now drill toward the center
of the core to make a pinhole. 

30
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,481
this allows the core to be suspended        

31
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,752
in just the right position in a second mold.       

32
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,360
this asymmetrical core is about to be encased     

33
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,895
in a more uniform sphere.   

34
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,698
they tamp the core       
into the bottom part of the mold

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,634
and then lock down the top half.

36
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:51,236
after all, they don't want any leaks   

37
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,371
as they pump it full of plastic.

38
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,241
it's a liquid-polymer blend.  

39
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:59,178
a special chemical in it causes
the mix to solidify slowly.  

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,114
it can take days for it to harden around the core,   

41
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,716
depending on the formulation  

42
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,452
and type of bowling ball being made.          

43
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,324
when they knock it out of the mold,        

44
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,726
all is revealed.        

45
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,461
that asymmetrical core is now sealed         

46
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,031
in a very symmetrical polymer shell.         

47
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,937
next, it's into a third mold. 

48
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,939
this one will seal the bowling ball   

49
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,009
in an outer skin called the veneer.       

50
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,545
this veneer has been scientifically formulated   

51
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,082
to enhance the ball's traction 

52
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:38,851
as it hooks towards the bowling pins.   

53
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,356
it's made of colorant, plasticizer,          

54
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:47,293
a chemical called i.s.o., and urethane.         

55
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,294
blending these ingredients   

56
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,631
produces high-performance polyurethane.         

57
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,368
as the mix flows into the molds,
a chemical reaction      

58
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,707
causes it to heat up and solidify in just seconds. 

59
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,911
then it's into an oven to boost the chemical reaction.

60
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,186
next, a spinning grinder shaves off the bump,      

61
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,790
which was formed by overflow at the mold's intake tube.   

62
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,925
the removal of this bump    

63
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,762
rounds off the shape of the bowling ball.      

64
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,268
with its three layers, this bowling ball       

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,605
looks a bit like a big bonbon when it's sliced in two.    

66
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,874
and while it may look sweet, it needs a bit more work    

67
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,744
before it's ready to take on the competition.  

68
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,346
a lift system delivers the bowling ball        

69
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,617
to a sanding operation, which roughs up the surface.  

70
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,152
the coarseness of the sanding varies,     

71
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,421
depending on the performance goals    

72
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:53,158
of the particular ball.    

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,028
this machine heat-stamps trademark information     

74
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,663
onto the ball.         

75
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,443
they do one last sanding,   

76
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,113
as a constant flow of water removes the powdery residue.  

77
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,916
the more polished the surface, 

78
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,185
the less pronounced the ball's hooking action will be.    

79
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,655
even this last sanding     

80
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,390
is geared to a certain performance standard.      

81
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,127
once they buff the surface, all that's left        

82
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,963
is to custom-drill the finger holes.        

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,334
with this bowling ball in hand,

84
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,737
success should be within striking distance.   

85
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,022
narrator: barber poles go back to a time 

86
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,491
when barbers also performed surgery,    

87
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,760
tooth extractions, and bloodletting.        

88
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,896
some believe that the idea for the red and white strips  

89
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,699
came about because of bloody and clean bandages       

90
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,768
that twisted together in the wind          

91
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,772
as the customer held onto a pole
during a procedure.      

92
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,711
over time,           

93
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,248
barber poles have come to lose their gruesome connotation   

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,352
but not their place as an historic symbol.     

95
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,324
there's only one company left in north america        

96
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,525
that makes them.        

97
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,928
they begin by rolling a printed liner   

98
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,930
onto a wooden mandrel.     

99
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,732
the mandrel they use      

100
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,668
depends on the size of the pole they're making.  

101
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:51,543
using a knife, they score the liner at both ends.    

102
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,746
the liner is made of paper and vinyl       

103
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:57,116
treated with u.v. protection to prevent it from fading.   

104
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,422
scoring the liner helps guide the worker     

105
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,625
as he trims the familiar red-white-and-blue material  

106
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,061
to the required length.    

107
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:21,974
next, he rivets the company logo
to a support frame.      

108
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,642
then with bolts,        

109
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,278
he attaches a top and bottom support casting.  

110
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,450
the frame and castings are made of aluminum,      

111
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,054
so they're virtually rustproof,
which is a big plus      

112
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,057
since barber poles have to weather the elements. 

113
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,263
after ensuring the assembly is level,     

114
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,264
they install the glass cylinder,

115
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,801
which can be made out of extruded        

116
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,836
or handblown glass.      

117
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,077
after a final tightening,   

118
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,347
they double-check that everything fits snugly.  

119
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:08,220
next, they add water to a special caulking powder  

120
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,623
and mix it to a smooth consistency.    

121
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,293
the caulking must be just the right thickness    

122
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,429
to properly fill the cavity between the aluminum casting  

123
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,665
and the glass cylinder.    

124
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,906
five minutes later when the caulking is dry,   

125
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,975
they carefully trim off the excess           

126
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,643
on both ends of the cylinder, 

127
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,579
leaving behind a smooth, watertight seal        

128
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,183
that helps secure the glass cylinder in place.  

129
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,657
cleaning the glass by hand is just another example    

130
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,994
of all the artisanal handiwork that goes into making     

131
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,497
these time-honored barber poles.         

132
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,873
next, they mount the assembly on a hook           

133
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,275
and paint the caulking with a colored sealer      

134
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,542
that matches the casting    

135
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,112
and makes the caulking waterproof.          

136
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,288
after that, a worker puts in a motor mechanism.       

137
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,557
the motor will rotate the printed liner       

138
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,160
inside the glass cylinder.   

139
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,235
once the motor is hooked up, he takes an inner cylinder,   

140
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,771
which has the printed liner mounted on it,         

141
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,906
and installs it        

142
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:38,243
on top of the mechanism that makes it rotate.     

143
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,112
he then installs a two-socket light fixture   

144
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,715
with a bulb that illuminates the liner.  

145
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:53,191
to keep the printed liner straight as it turns,     

146
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,762
he then attaches what's called a top-cylinder bushing.    

147
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,870
all that's left to complete the pole      

148
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,339
is to attach a rustproof aluminum cover   

149
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,408
and the second light bulb   

150
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,710
that lights up the white glass globe.     

151
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,819
finally, he hooks up the pole to electricity         

152
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,289
and makes sure the motor, both lights,          

153
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,959
and the inner liner are working properly,     

154
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,328
creating the illusion of movement.          

155
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,033
modern barber poles come in various sizes and styles,  

156
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,835
with or without illuminating globes,      

157
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,073
but they always keep their link
to the past.          

158
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,926
narrator: when production hits a snarl at the felt factory,  

159
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,594
things are going well.     

160
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,329
that's because felt is made  

161
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,065
by entangling fibers into a matted material.    

162
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,269
felt has actually been around for thousands of years     

163
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:13,004
and may be the first fabric ever produced.         

164
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,009
these days, mechanization puts a new twist on felt.   

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,146
boot liners are an example   

166
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,683
of the way felt layers our lives.       

167
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,420
they begin with bales of polyester fibers.      

168
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:33,358
sometimes they add wool or synthetic fiber.      

169
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
this machine is about to sink its teeth   

170
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,228
into those fibers.       

171
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,630
it's a rotating bed      

172
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:42,668
with hundreds of fierce-looking
spikes protruding from it.   

173
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,375
an operator loads the bales of fibers      

174
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,045
onto a feeder conveyor.    

175
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,447
it shuffles the clumps toward that spiked conveyor,  

176
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,151
which snags the fibers     

177
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:02,454
and takes them up       
to another spiked rotating belt.

178
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,457
but this one moves in a different direction    

179
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,961
to grab and pull the short, springy fibers apart.     

180
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,665
the process fluffs and blends the fibers,     

181
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,134
transforming the dense clumps 

182
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:20,872
into something that's the consistency of cotton wool.

183
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,142
now that the fibers have been loosened up,     

184
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,344
it will be easier to extract any metal bits   

185
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,282
that may have contaminated the bales early on.      

186
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,951
a magnet pulls out these contaminants,      

187
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,286
which would otherwise cause damage          

188
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,689
to equipment down the line.  

189
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,558
with the metal bits removed,  

190
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,361
the fibers move into another machine.     

191
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,898
this one has a series of pinned rollers       

192
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,567
that are close enough to almost touch.        

193
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,837
they rotate in different directions to align the fibers.

194
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,841
this creates a uniform web of fluff.    

195
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,646
then it's over to the cross lapper --     

196
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,248
a system of conveyors that move back and forth    

197
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,084
to neatly fold it up.     

198
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,189
they then travel between rollers,        

199
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,924
which squeeze several layers down      

200
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:17,796
to a thickness of a little more
than a centimeter.       

201
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,266
10,000 long needles repeatedly stab the compressed web    

202
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,535
to entangle the fibers.    

203
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,607
each needle is equipped with nine barbs        

204
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,676
to snare the polyester fibers. 

205
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,713
this process is how they become enmeshed.  

206
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,455
it transforms the compacted fluff into felt. 

207
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,894
rollers pull the matted material
out of the machine...     

208
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,231
as they wind it onto a big roll.

209
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,301
you can see that the fibers are now a solid mass.     

210
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,107
next, they layer two piles of felt  

211
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,175
onto a metalized nylon film.  

212
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,512
this shiny film will reflect the outside cold, 

213
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,514
and the three layers combined 

214
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,916
will provide extra thermal protection    

215
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,788
that will even insulate against
arctic temperatures if need be.

216
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,191
more long needles punch into the three layers     

217
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,595
and entangle the fibers    
to create one sheet of material.

218
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,931
it's a form of laminating without glue.         

219
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:29,067
the needles leave little holes in the reflective film     

220
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,304
that improve the breathability of the fabric.         

221
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,809
next, a worker uses a 25-ton press         

222
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,680
to punch boot-liner patterns out of the felt.        

223
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,149
the press bears down on dyes  

224
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,284
that cut out various-sized insoles     

225
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,421
and boot-liner sidepieces.   

226
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,225
this felt is now ready     

227
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,762
to add a little warmth to someone's life.       

228
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:02,834
all they have to do is sew the parts together.   

229
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,503
the seamstress stitches the two sidepieces,      

230
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,173
using an industrial machine with needles          

231
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,176
that easily penetrate the thick,
stiff felt.          

232
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,181
the top of the boot liner is finished.          

233
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:19,117
but without its sole, it's incomplete.        

234
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:25,123
they sew the felt sole onto it with a neat loop stitch --   

235
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:30,395
the only stitch that would hold
this configuration together.  

236
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,465
from a pile of synthetic fibers
to a rigid liner        

237
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,601
that's ready to protect you against the elements,     

238
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,804
it's been quite a journey, and it's far from over,    

239
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,207
as felt continues to keep its foothold      

240
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,844
in the world of layers and liners.          

241
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,828
narrator: if you see one of these,    

242
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,430
it's likely connected to the long arm of the law.  

243
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,167
police have been using radar guns to nab speeders   

244
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,435
ever since the 1950s.     

245
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,637
they bounce radar off your vehicle        

246
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,573
and analyze the returning signal
to get a reading,       

247
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:18,443
and that's when sirens wail and the officer says,     

248
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,645
"do you know how fast you were going?"   

249
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,782
if you're a speeder,      

250
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,986
the police have probably got your number,          

251
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,054
thanks to the radar gun.    

252
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,123
when operated properly,    

253
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,259
radar guns boast an accuracy rate     

254
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,795
of plus or minus half a mile per hour.     

255
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:41,132
but of course, you can always try arguing with the officer. 

256
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,603
making a radar gun starts with cable wire --   

257
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,803
lots of it.          

258
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,205
rollers straighten it,     

259
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,540
then automated blades cut it to length        

260
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,843
and strip the plastic casing at both ends.         

261
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,882
with the wires now exposed,  

262
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,485
they're ready for the metal contacts     

263
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,488
that will allow wiring interconnections.    

264
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,492
a technician places      
the exposed wire in the contact,

265
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,428
and a machine crimps them together.     

266
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,065
they then assemble wires in various harnesses.     

267
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,336
these connect to a power cable and communications port.    

268
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,307
the technician inserts wires into a plastic connector    

269
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,045
to allow them to easily hook into a circuit board later.   

270
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,980
this little gadget       

271
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,783
is a microwave transmitter and receiver.         

272
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,053
it sends radio-frequency energy
to moving vehicles       

273
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,657
and then receives it when it bounces back.     

274
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,526
the red wires being soldered to its post   

275
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,194
will deliver power to it.   

276
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,731
the white ones will return the radar signals.       

277
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,668
this special plastic lens will focus the radar beam.   

278
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,872
she attaches the transmitter-receiver unit 

279
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:59,010
to the funnel-shaped antenna at the back of the lens.    

280
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,747
next, she solders wires to a circuit board.      

281
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,682
some will carry power to it.  

282
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,084
others will deliver      

283
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,553
the returning radar signals for analysis.         

284
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,626
this second smaller circuit board     

285
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,295
will process power from the police vehicle    

286
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,697
to operate the radar gun.   

287
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,099
and an insulated metal plate  

288
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,034
shields the unit from interference       

289
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,036
from things like the police radio.       

290
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,572
the technician secures it with cable ties,        

291
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,275
and this radar module is now complete.        

292
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,047
she moves on to the display and control panel       

293
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,451
and snaps the keypad onto a little circuit board  

294
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,654
just below a light-diffusing display window.        

295
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,859
she inserts the control-panel hardware   

296
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:51,329
into a plastic faceplate and secures it with screws.  

297
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,865
as another safeguard      
against electrical interference,

298
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:59,270
this plastic faceplate has been infused with metal.  

299
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,006
he wires the control panel to the power board       

300
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,475
to run a test.         

301
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,678
he checks all the digits and icons           

302
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,815
to confirm they display correctly.    

303
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,284
this machine presses melted plastic     

304
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,087
into the shape of casing for the radar gun.       

305
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,690
a static discharger worn on the wrist       

306
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,892
dissipates any static electricity     

307
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,695
from the technician's body.  

308
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,232
this prevents damage to    
sensitive electrical components,

309
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:31,836
so it's worn throughout the assembly process.     

310
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,105
she links the two computer boards,    

311
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,840
ensuring a good connection,  

312
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,109
because one will power the other.           

313
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,449
then she installs the radar gun
in the molded casing.     

314
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,921
she plugs the display assembly 

315
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:54,925
into connectors on one of the computer boards. 

316
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,697
then she slides it into grooves in the casing.  

317
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,734
now she hooks up this radar gun

318
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,870
to a power source for a trial run.        

319
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,740
she taps the lens with a tuning fork.      

320
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:12,677
the gun responds to it     
as it would to a moving vehicle.

321
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,848
if it functions properly,   
she installs the trigger switch.

322
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,353
she closes the radar gun,   

323
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,291
securing the two-part casing with screws.          

324
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:30,028
a serial number and other identifying information    

325
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,230
goes on the side.       

326
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,234
in a final test, she connects the radar gun to a computer  

327
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,569
and aims the lens into a chamber.        

328
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,104
the chamber sends signals   

329
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,907
to simulate the effect of a moving vehicle,      

330
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,977
and the computer analyzes the gun's performance.     

331
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,114
you only have to look at a 35-year-old radar gun   

332
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,383
to see that this technology has come a long way.      

333
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:56,121
so it's ready if you try to pull a fast one. 

334
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,795
