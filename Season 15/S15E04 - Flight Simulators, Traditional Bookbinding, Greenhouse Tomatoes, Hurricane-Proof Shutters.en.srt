1
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:55,121
narrator: most hands-on pilot training occurs not in the air,

2
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,455
but on the ground.       

3
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,457
the classroom in which this instruction takes place  

4
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,791
is a flight simulator --    

5
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,461
a high-tech replica of the aircraft cockpit.    

6
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,731
through the magic of      
sophisticated computer software,

7
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,002
the simulator mimics the process
and feel of flying the aircraft.

8
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,809
the flight simulator can produce
darkness or daylight,     

9
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,343
clear or stormy weather,    

10
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,813
or an emergency such as engine failure     

11
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,082
or a runway tire blowout.   

12
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,156
simulators are modeled after specific aircraft,    

13
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:33,092
such as a boeing 737.     

14
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,694
the simulator manufacturer buys the technical data    

15
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,897
from the aircraft manufacturer 

16
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,432
so it can build a cockpit   

17
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:42,535
which is an exact replica in both look and feel.     

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,973
after assembling a steel frame 

19
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,043
and building the instructor's station behind the cockpit,  

20
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,980
they mount a sound system beneath the cockpit.      

21
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:56,181
this enables crew communication

22
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,852
and produces realistic aircraft
and weather sounds.      

23
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:03,455
a computer-driven image generator        

24
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,925
produces the cockpit view on a large, spherical mirror  

25
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,395
made of a thin polyester film. 

26
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,737
a vacuum pump sucks it flat and wrinkle-free.       

27
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,142
the image reflecting on the mirror creates the illusion

28
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,112
of the infinite view pilots have
in a real aircraft.      

29
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,156
the image generator doesn't send the visuals    

30
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,092
directly to the spherical mirror
facing the pilots.       

31
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,229
a projector first shoots the image     

32
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,232
onto a flat, rectangular mirror
that reflects the image    

33
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,634
onto a front projection screen --      

34
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,370
that round part at the top.  

35
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,440
the image on the projection screen then reflects      

36
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:57,476
in the spherical mirror in front of the pilots.    

37
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,549
this diagram illustrates how the image travels.     

38
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,054
technicians prepare the cockpit throttles,     

39
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,656
adjusting the lever tension  

40
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,292
to be identical to that of the real aircraft.     

41
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,264
inside each throttle, they check the thrust reverser 

42
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,667
that pilots activate upon touchdown         

43
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,637
to reverse air flow and stop the plane.      

44
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,475
next come the control panels, 

45
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,812
with all the buttons and switches to operate everything 

46
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,648
from the engines to the air-conditioning to the lights.

47
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,695
next, the motion actuators -- 

48
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,297
giant legs which move the cockpit.    

49
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,902
they attach to a concrete slab with jumbo bolts.       

50
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,505
technicians attach conduits  

51
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,907
through which electrical cables
and air hoses run       

52
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,043
to the actuators.       

53
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,512
the motion is electropneumatic,

54
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,581
meaning that air assists the electric motor   

55
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,583
that moves the legs.      

56
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,523
to attach the actuators,    

57
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,526
technicians activate the brake inside each one.        

58
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,198
this enables the leg to stretch
far enough to reach the base. 

59
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,207
after checking the alignment with this tool...       

60
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,513
...they insert a pin.     

61
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,755
then they test the movement of the entire apparatus.    

62
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,561
the test pilot runs the finished flight simulator 

63
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,296
through different maneuvers  

64
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,165
to ensure it performs perfectly.

65
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,239
the image generator is run by highly sophisticated software. 

66
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,910
it knows the design of every airport in the world, 

67
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,711
enabling the instructor    

68
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,781
to conjure up any scenario imaginable...   

69
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,785
takeoffs, landings, and taxiing
at a specific airport,     

70
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,055
any weather conditions or runway hazards,       

71
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,658
or any unforeseen events, such as a blackout       

72
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,561
that plunges the entire airport
into darkness.         

73
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,733
faking it doesn't get any more real than this.    

74
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:56,755
narrator: today's books are mass-produced

75
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,089
by automated equipment,    

76
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,693
but before the industry was mechanized,        

77
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,360
book pages were hand-bound,  

78
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,763
their covers meticulously hand-crafted   

79
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,832
one at a time by talented book binders.   

80
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:12,371
this skilled trade still exists,
but is now a specialty service. 

81
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,443
book binders are part artist, part restorer,         

82
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:22,348
because they craft new bindings,
yet also repair originals.   

83
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,121
before rebinding a book, the book binder has to unbind it. 

84
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,860
she uses a surgical scalpel  

85
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,929
to cut the strands of old binding thread.     

86
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:41,266
this separates the covers and 
the sections of assembled paged,

87
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,701
called signatures.       

88
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:54,146
using a paper cutter, she trims the components    

89
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:57,116
just enough to make their edges
neat and smooth.        

90
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,621
then she positions the signatures in a vice,   

91
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,624
sandwiched between cardboard for support.          

92
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,828
she draws lines across what will be the spine of the book. 

93
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,098
then she carefully saws a groove
in each line.         

94
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,968
the groove is just big enough 

95
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,238
to fit a piece of hemp binding cord.     

96
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,708
one at a time,         

97
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,878
she reconnects the signatures on a sewing frame.       

98
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:29,915
the frame has binding cords  

99
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,818
that correspond to the grooves she sawed into the signatures. 

100
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,458
she sews a linen thread horizontally,         

101
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,659
looping it around the cords.  

102
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,396
a chain stitch on each end   

103
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:47,666
links each signature to the neighboring one.    

104
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,470
when she's done, she coats the sewn area with glue.    

105
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,942
she then lays a thin cloth backing over the glue,  

106
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,679
then closes the vice tightly to round the back       

107
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,816
and form joints into which the book's covers will fit.  

108
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,385
she perfects the joints using a hammer.        

109
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,760
next, she weaves the binding's headband     

110
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,895
by wrapping threads around support sticks     

111
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,296
in a specific pattern.     

112
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,966
she does this on both the top and bottom           

113
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,801
of what will be the book's spine.       

114
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
next, by folding and gluing pieces of paper,  

115
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,651
she constructs a tube the exact
width and length of the spine. 

116
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,790
she glues the tube to the spine.

117
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,933
now for the book's front cover.

118
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:59,070
she layers pieces of cardboard to create a design,      

119
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,474
then glues it onto a rectangular piece of leather.

120
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,879
she presses the leather against the cardboard     

121
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,349
with a plastic tool called a bone folder.     

122
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,953
next, she cuts a strip of thick paper         

123
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,955
the width of the book spine  

124
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,825
and glues small bands across it.

125
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,494
then she glues this onto the leather,       

126
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,362
right next to the cardboard.  

127
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,232
using the bone folder again, she presses the leather down. 

128
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,173
after adding a second cardboard
for the back cover,      

129
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,509
she glues and folds over the edges.   

130
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,383
then she makes two swift incisions      

131
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,920
to remove a triangle of leather.

132
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,889
this produces perfect corners every time.          

133
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,132
next step -- to embellish the cover and spine      

134
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,935
with gold-embossed decorations and lettering.         

135
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,803
she lays down a sheet of genuine gold foil      

136
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,007
and hot-stamps the design onto the surface.       

137
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,881
after attaching the bound pages

138
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,217
with leather hinges that match the cover,     

139
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,819
the book binder applies the finishing touch --     

140
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,689
decorative paper on the inside covers.     

141
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:37,636
from such traditional styles to
ultramodern fish-skin bindings,

142
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,540
it's hard not to judge these books by their covers.  

143
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,324
narrator: some of the finest tomatoes  

144
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,526
come not from the field, but from the greenhouse.    

145
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,662
when cultivating tomatoes indoors,            

146
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,798
producers can strictly control the growing conditions,    

147
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,067
so greenhouse tomatoes are more uniform        

148
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,871
in size, shape, and color than field-grown tomatoes.   

149
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,474
some would argue that they taste better, too.  

150
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,613
this company grows large cluster type    

151
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,349
and smaller cocktail-size tomatoes.    

152
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,753
it also produces a kit containing tomatoes,      

153
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:32,558
a pouch of italian spices, and a bruschetta recipe.    

154
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,559
in this hydroponic greenhouse, 

155
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,096
the tomato plants grow     
in a substrate rather than soil.

156
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,034
the substrate is a block of coconut-shell fibers     

157
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,637
that retains and drains water very well.           

158
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,911
greenhouse workers mix fertilizer         

159
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,981
primarily out of powdered iron and calcium nitrate.      

160
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,454
they dissolve these and additional chemicals in water, 

161
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,090
which they then dilute and store in tanks.      

162
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,060
computerized fertilizer injectors      

163
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,463
shoot controlled amounts of the solution        

164
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,066
directly into the irrigation-system water supply.

165
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:22,206
a new tomato plant takes 30 to 55 days to blossom,

166
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,178
then another 8 weeks to produce fully ripened fruit.

167
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,281
each plant receives      

168
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:31,883
up to one gallon of fertilized water per day  

169
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,785
via an irrigation dripper.   

170
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,622
the irrigation system collects 

171
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,758
whatever the plant doesn't absorb,        

172
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,094
mixes it with fresh water, adjusts the fertilization,   

173
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,130
then re-feeds it to the plants.

174
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,435
the task of pollination    

175
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,739
is left to a resident colony of bumblebees.         

176
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:06,117
the plants grow at an astounding
rate of 8 to 12 inches per week.

177
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,452
to train them upright     

178
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,655
so they won't get tangled with neighboring plants,    

179
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:14,459
workers twist each one around a nylon cord every week.

180
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,271
tomato plants grow to a height of more than 36 feet.     

181
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,740
that's taller than the greenhouse,      

182
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,675
which is why, once a week,   

183
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,445
workers lower the plants by 8 inches.          

184
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,218
the lowering process also lines
them up at the same height,  

185
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,487
which makes harvesting much easier.          

186
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,895
the greenhouse temperature   

187
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,998
is 70 to 77 degrees fahrenheit during the day         

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,035
and 54 to 61 degrees at night. 

189
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:01,239
artificial lighting simulates 18-hour stretches of sunshine. 

190
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,576
thanks to these controlled growing conditions,      

191
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,712
greenhouse tomato plants, unlike field plants,      

192
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,914
are in continuous bloom.    

193
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,117
every week,          

194
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,720
a new cluster appears at the top
of each plant,         

195
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,689
while a cluster at the bottom is ready for picking.     

196
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,866
in its one-year lifetime,   

197
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,802
a tomato plant yields some 200 large tomatoes    

198
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,372
or 500 cocktail tomatoes.   

199
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,146
as conveyor belts move the tomatoes       

200
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,081
through the packaging area,  

201
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,751
workers separate the green ones
from the ripe ones.      

202
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:55,627
each shipping box must contain 11 pounds.    

203
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,663
workers place the box on a tray scale        

204
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,434
and clusters of tomatoes on digital scales above it.  

205
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:03,969
a computer calculates     

206
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:07,639
which combination of clusters would total the target weight, 

207
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,107
then illuminates the light under those clusters      

208
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,978
to tell the packer which ones to put in the box. 

209
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,516
once filled, the box is passed 

210
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,851
through an automated labeling machine.       

211
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,587
a camera takes a photo of the configuration,      

212
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,922
then guides an applicator   

213
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,191
to slap a code sticker on every tomato.        

214
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,930
besides selling bulk tomatoes in the bruschetta kit,     

215
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,868
this company packages cocktail tomatoes in two formats --   

216
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,004
loose and still on the vine... 

217
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,676
...giving greenhouse-tomato lovers a few tasty options.  

218
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,693
narrator: hurricane-proof shutters    

219
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,562
prevent violent winds and flying debris       

220
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,564
from shattering windows.    

221
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,900
not only can breaking glass cause injury          

222
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,569
and let winds enter and wreak destruction inside, 

223
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,773
but the difference between indoor and outdoor air pressure

224
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,409
can cause the roof and walls to collapse.          

225
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,249
roll-down shutters move vertically...       

226
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,984
whereas accordion shutters   

227
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,888
consist of two sections that move sideways.      

228
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,858
to make the accordion style,  

229
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,996
they cut stacks of blades to the
height of the customer's window.

230
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,198
blades are interlocking aluminum strips        

231
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,401
manufactured for the shutter factory by a supplier.     

232
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,938
workers assemble enough to build two shutter sections 

233
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,474
that cover the width of the window.         

234
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,644
these two sections are called vertical stacks.  

235
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:58,750
they punch holes in the last blade of each stack      

236
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,785
for a locking mechanism.    

237
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,824
these two blades are called center mates    

238
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,426
because they overlap at the center of the window  

239
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,961
and lock together.       

240
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,835
they slide each center mate into
its respective vertical stack. 

241
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:21,439
the next step is attaching nylon bushings and wheels,   

242
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,508
which ride in horizontal tracks

243
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,044
installed at the top and bottom
of the window opening.     

244
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,916
each center mate has vertical locking pins.   

245
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,717
activated by a thumbscrew,   

246
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,654
these pins slide through a hole in the track  

247
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:38,123
to lock the shutter open or closed.           

248
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,395
the horizontal slats of a roll-down shutter     

249
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,197
are made of the same material 

250
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,433
as the accordion shutter's vertical blades.        

251
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:54,205
after cutting the slats to the width of the customer's window,

252
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,208
workers assemble enough to cover the window's height. 

253
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,878
these slats have a different type of interlock       

254
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,080
than the accordion shutter blades,        

255
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,215
but they connect the same way. 

256
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,817
the tongue edge of one blade  

257
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,119
slides into the groove edge of the next.          

258
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:15,092
nylon locks prevent the slats from disconnecting.      

259
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,829
after hammering the locks into place,          

260
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,632
they crimp the edge of each slat.         

261
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,568
the connected slats will later be coiled      

262
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,972
around a motorized tube inside the shutter's aluminum housing.

263
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,446
a technician installs a ball-bearing assembly    

264
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,981
in one side of that housing... 

265
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,316
then a safety plate      

266
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,720
to prevent the slat roll from shifting sideways.     

267
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,459
on the other side, they install
a plate with protruding screws 

268
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,295
to which they mount the motor. 

269
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,333
next, they install a safety plate to prevent the slats   

270
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,735
from catching on the motor's power cord.   

271
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,039
on each end of the motor, they fit spacers...      

272
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,880
...then, over the motor, a roller tube.         

273
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,756
they insert a connecting shaft,
which attaches the tube    

274
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,291
to the ball-bearing assembly on the other side.       

275
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,363
all these steps assemble a motorized axle        

276
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,832
around which the roll of slats will wrap.           

277
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,636
once a quality-control check ensures            

278
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,505
it operates flawlessly...   

279
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,843
they close off the back of the housing with an aluminum cover.

280
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,653
working from the front of the housing,        

281
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,923
they rivet plastic rings along the length of the tube. 

282
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,526
these help muffle the noise the slats make         

283
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,294
as they roll and unroll.    

284
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:03,334
workers rivet slat hangers to the roller tube.      

285
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,041
they slide the first slat onto these hangers.      

286
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,514
then they slide the slat roll onto that first slat.     

287
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,953
the slat edges run in vertical side rails,    

288
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,657
which installers mount in the window opening.     

289
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,632
now for a last round of quality-control testing.  

290
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,302
workers lift and lower the shutter in manual mode,  

291
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,405
as well as by remote control. 

292
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,777
when everything works perfectly,

293
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,445
the shutters are subjected to one final test       

294
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,615
to ensure they can handle everything   

295
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,184
that a hurricane can muster.
