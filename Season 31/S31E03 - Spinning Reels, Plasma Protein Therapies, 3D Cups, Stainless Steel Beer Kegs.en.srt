narrator: spinning reels are also called fixed spool reels.   

10
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:01,126
that's because the spool on this
fishing reel doesn't rotate.  

11
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,330
instead, a device around the spool does the spinning,  

12
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,465
which winds the fishing line. 

13
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,867
the advantage of using a non-spinning spool      

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:13,138
is there's no backlash of the line.          

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,341
a spinning reel provides a unique twist on fishing.   

16
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,612
unlike other reels, the spool doesn't rotate.   

17
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:22,047
instead, a pivoting, u-shaped wire         

18
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,219
called a bail spins around the spool to wrap the line.  

19
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,554
making a spinning reel     

20
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:32,024
starts with a cylindrical chunk of aluminum.       

21
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,361
computerized cutters carve the cylinder into the rotor  

22
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,898
that spins the bail around the reel spool.     

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,834
the transformation is complete.

24
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,905
the cutter sculpts side arms  
onto the rotor to hold the bail,

25
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:48,774
carving a hole for the spool shaft.      

26
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,777
then a protective finish is applied to the rotor,    

27
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,246
and the bail is attached.   

28
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,383
next, a craftsman heats a cylindrical piece of steel  

29
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,919
in a furnace until it's hot and flexible.  

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,654
then it's transferred over to a press           

31
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,323
that flattens the cylinder.  

32
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,128
the worker inserts the hot steel puck into a mold.    

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,465
the top half descends and forces
the steel into the crevices.  

34
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,601
tools cut teeth into the part, 

35
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,871
completing the transformation into a gear.          

36
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:23,075
next, the gear housing is formed
using aluminum alloy.     

37
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,011
to trim the excess material from around the edges,     

38
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,146
designers use a die cutter.  

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,748
it punches down a part,    

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,951
which then slides down a chute into a bin.          

41
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,088
at another station, a laser etches the company name    

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,324
and the product number into the part.         

43
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,796
the gear system is now ready to be assembled.        

44
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:53,172
the technician brushes oil on a transmission gear...   

45
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,240
installs it in the gear housing

46
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,876
and screws it in place.    

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,184
next, a part called a slider is placed on top of the gear. 

48
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,852
the ends of the slider are attached          

49
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,955
to the spinning reel body using thick pins.       

50
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,194
the slider moves the spool up 

51
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,064
and down as the bail spins the line.        

52
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,801
oil is applied onto the neck of the gear body,       

53
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:27,339
and a helical pinion is inserted into the gear.   

54
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,941
next, the technician installs a roller element        

55
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,878
on the extended part of the pinion gear.      

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,548
a retaining ring is positioned between the bearing      

57
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,151
and the gear body.       

58
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,753
then a wider steel ring    

59
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:45,224
is placed onto the outside of the neck. 

60
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:49,161
an outer metal sleeve holds the part together.    

61
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:53,833
the threaded end of the pinion gear is set on top. 

62
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:57,236
next, the rotor is attached on the end of the pinion gear 

63
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,906
and secured with a nut.    

64
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,042
this connects the rotor to the gear.          

65
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:10,849
the rotor is tested to confirm that it's operating smoothly. 

66
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,519
another operator places the main gear in the gear body 

67
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:18,457
so that the lower teeth engage with the other gears.     

68
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,294
the operator slides a metal washer on the gear shaft    

69
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,965
and links a main axle shaft to the slider.         

70
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:30,369
the operator screws the end of the shaft to the slider... 

71
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,209
...and inserts thick pins into the gear housing.     

72
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,577
they'll prevent the main gear 

73
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,946
from turning in the wrong direction.    

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:45,818
the spinning reel gear system is now complete.        

75
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,289
next, an operator attaches a side plate to the gear body. 

76
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,491
this encases the spinning reel's gear system.      

77
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,561
the threaded fitting will enable
the gears           

78
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,429
to be linked to a handle.

81
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,906
so the line will slip instead of breaking      

82
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,043
when pulled by a powerful fish.

83
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:15,414
a drag adjustment knob is   
screwed to the end of the spool,

84
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,850
then the technician fastens the handle       

85
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,685
to the fitting in the gear body

86
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,588
and checks to confirm it operates smoothly.     

87
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,727
an automated testing system turns the handle

narrator: plasma is a yellow-colored liquid component of blood   

95
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,495
that holds blood cells in suspension.

bleeding disorders, and immune deficiencies.    

101
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,585
first, the plasma is separated from the blood cells      

102
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,986
and placed in a freezer

at a temperature of minus-4 degrees fahrenheit. 

104

this process preserves it until
scientists can test its quality.

105

00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,102
the plasma remains adequately frozen.       

108
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,874
ready for production, the plasma
goes from a freezer to a cooler,

109
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,945
and then a warming bath to thaw the outer layer.    

110
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:01,020
a machine collects the bottles and moves them into slots.

00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:10,095
but the cores are still frozen.

114
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,367
then the plasma travels forward
to a heated mixing tank.    

115
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,037
the agitator and heat break up the chunks,          

116
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:21,106
and the plasma becomes liquid. 

117
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,843
transferred to other tanks, technicians expose the plasma 

118
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,114
to conditions that cause the proteins to become insoluble. 

119
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,316
they're pressed into slabs.  

120
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:35,587
in this form, the proteins are known as precipitate.   

121
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,589
a technician scrapes the precipitate        

122
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,058
off the filter sheets     

123
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,195
and into a plastic-lined container.           

124
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,931
an automated system retrieves the filter sheets       

125
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,799
and takes them through wash stations

once thoroughly washed,    

128
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,341
the filter sheets are ready for the next filtration.    

129
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,944
a technician breaks the protein chunks       

130
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,348
into smaller pieces and bags them for freezing.  

131
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,818
this protein is called albumin.

132
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,954
albumin helps maintain and repair tissue growth.   

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:14,960
next, technicians dissolve the albumin protein in water. 

134
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,896
they remove the precipitate from the freezer        

135
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,332
and pound the outside of the bag
to further reduce

the size of the pieces inside. 

137
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,574
then the bags of precipitate are emptied into the mixer,  

138
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,909
causing the particles to disperse.          

139
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,914
over the next day and a half, 

140
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:40,853
processing continues to purify and concentrate the albumin.  

141
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:44,122
at the same time, glass bottles
enter into a chamber      

142
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,725
with cameras to take pictures of each bottle.        

143
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,528
a computer locates defective bottles       

144
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,933
and signals a mechanism to knock them out of the line. 

145
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,203
the bottles cycle through a washing machine,   

146
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,639
and then a hot tunnel for sterilization.       

147
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,877
they're now ready for the albumin protein.    

148
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,881
needles inject the protein into the bottles,       

149
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,350
filling eight bottles simultaneously.

a robotic arm inserts stoppers in the neck of the bottles.

then a machine installs aluminum seals with flip caps. 

152
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:31,837
