narrator: the exact origins  
of the cotton plant are unknown,

11
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,924
although archeologists have unearthed pieces     

12
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:02,128
of cotton cloth over 7,000 years old.     

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,863
through the centuries, cotton fiber was traditionally 

14
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,534
processed by hand until the first 18th century, 

15
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,736
when the first automated processing machine  

16
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,271
was invented.         

17
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:17,476
before cotton arrives at the textile mill to be spun 

18
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,679
into thread and woven into fabric,     

19
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,448
it makes the journey from field to bale.      

20
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,018
cotton takes about five months 

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,154
to grow from a planted seed to a ripe plant.        

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,557
this harvesting machine, called a cotton picker,    

23
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,760
plucks fluffy seed cotton out of the plant's bowl,    

24
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,297
leaving a trail of burrs and sticks behind.    

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,566
the machine empties the plucked cotton       

26
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:43,235
into a tractor-drawn buggy.  

27
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,570
this machine builds the seed cotton        

28
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:49,508
into a humongous rectangular block called a module.     

29
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,577
a truck transports the module 

30
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,648
to the processing plant, known as a cotton gin.     

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,718
once the cotton        
arrives to the processing plant,

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,786
sticks and burrs are removed, 

33
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,656
as well as any lingering debris
and seeds.           

34
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,393
a truck dumps the module into a feeder,   

35
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,397
which moves the packed seed cotton into a dispenser. 

36
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,333
the ground seed cotton falls  

37
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,737
onto a conveyor belt, which leads to the hot box.  

38
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,739
the hot box mixes the seed cotton with hot air, 

39
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,208
which allows the moisture to evaporate,         

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,413
making the seed cotton easier to clean.        

41
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,748
a machine called the wad buster     

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,684
breaks up the clumps of seed cotton   

43
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,220
by tossing it against a screen.

44
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:37,156
loose debris falls through the screen openings,      

45
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,158
down a narrow shoot.      

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,493
then the seed cotton moves through a machine    

47
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,229
called the steady flow, which divides it equally    

48
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,965
between two processing lines. 

49
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,304
on each line, the seed cotton enters a burr machine,     

50
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,307
which grabs the seed cotton with a circular saw      

51
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,909
and swings it against metal bars.      

52
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,113
the centrifugal force shakes off the heavier debris.    

53
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,517
the seed cotton exits the machine       

54
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,255
through one pipe, and the debris through another.

55
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,991
a large auger transfers the debris      

56
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:15,461
to a waste chute and out of the plant.     

57
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,966
the seed cotton is ready    

58
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,836
for the final stage of processing.         

59
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,007
a network of pipes feeds a row of machines    

60
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,011
called gin stands.       

61
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:35,347
the gin stand separates the seed
from the fluffy stuff,     

62
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,283
called the lint.        

63
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:41,887
inside each stand are 116 circular saws,     

64
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,289
which are arranged horizontally,

65
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,892
each separated by a steel rib. 

66
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,095
the saw teeth grab the seed cotton and pull the lint    

67
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,499
through the narrow gap between saw and rib.      

68
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,634
the seed is too large to pass through,        

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,839
so it spins in front of the  
rib, then drops into a conveyor.

70
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:04,042
the lint goes into a flue   
which leads to the packing area.

71
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,045
cotton seed is sold as livestock feed,   

72
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,782
particularly for dairy cows.  

73
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:15,921
it contains 23% protein, 20% fat, and 25% fiber.    

74
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,124
cotton seed is also milled into cotton seed oil,     

75
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,327
a cooking oil that's a common ingredient

the cotton lint is now ready to be formed into bales.    

78

pipes feed the loose lint to the press area.       

79
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:37,342
when it arrives, a pusher moves the lint into a machine

00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,612
called the tramper, which shoves it down

00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:52,144
the coil unwinds, moving between rollers.

next, the tubing travels through
a welding operation.

rollers close the gap, and a welder fuses the seam.

the operator makes two bends in the tubing,

00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,699
to generate the machining instructions.  

307
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,436
traditional rotary engines have an oblong shaped housing 

308
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,440
and a triangular rotor that spins within the interior.

309
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,310
this new design performs differently.     

310
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,914
computerized tools profile the triangular housing,    

311
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,916
creating combustion chambers on the inside         

312
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,519
and cooling fins on the outside.

313
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,722
they transform a solid hardened steel cylinder    

314
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,459
into a hollow crank shaft.   

315
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,661
the cylinder turns in a lathe 

316
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,931
as a series of cutters sculpt it together,      

317
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,800
creating a hollow crankshaft  

318
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:53,138
that will funnel air and fuel into the engine.        

319
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,476
computerized tools mill a piece
of steel to a precise geometry.

320
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,144
this peanut-shaped rotor    

321
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,482
is the heart of the rotary engine.     

322
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:07,619
the rotor is immersed in de-ionized water      

323
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,154
as an electrified brass wire generates      

324
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,825
a spark that cuts into the steel.        

325
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,361
this step forms a ridged hole in the center       

326
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,830
that will connect to a gear.  

327
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,568
a technician inserts the pinion gear in a vessel  

328
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,904
which will engage with the ridged profile    

329
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,772
in the center of the rotor.  

330
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,175
then the technician fills the vessel        

331
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,043
with liquid nitrogen,     

332
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,913
which freezes to        
negative 374 degrees fahrenheit.

333
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,517
the liquid nitrogen causes the gear to shrink.   

334
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,722
he transfers the frozen pinion gear to the rotor.   

335
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,625
using a press, he drives the pinion gear   

336
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,428
into the rotor to a specific depth.      

337
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,666
as the pinion gear thaws to room temperature,      

338
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,069
it expands to its original size,

339
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,373
allowing it to fit snugly in the rotor gear.       

340
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,343
another computerized machine  

341
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,347
carves into a piece of cast iron steel,      

342
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,549
held in the fixture by bolts. 

343
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,620
this piece will be the seal for the engine.    

344
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:19,690
the seal is sliver thin and tightly engineered.    

345
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,893
it's a critical part that will keep         

346
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:28,899
the rotary engine's working chambers air-tight.  

347
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,369
the seals will slide between the rotor       

348
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,306
and one of the engine's chrome-plated side plates.   

349
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,241
an automated grinding wheel gives      

350
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:41,379
the side plate a level and mirrored finish.  

351
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,915
heating the side plate causes the center board    

352
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,184
to temporarily widen.     

353
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,287
a technician inserts a bearing into the bore         

354
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:53,324
and, as it cools, it shrinks to the bearing.   

355
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:59,264
the assembler inserts the crank shaft in the side cover. 

356
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,734
he turns the assembly over and slides a ring gear       

357
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,403
into the cover.        

358
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,473
he sets the fixture in an upright position     

359
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,875
and turns the crankshaft to confirm   

360
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,346
that it revolves smoothly.   

361
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,283
he slides the rotor, equipped with one of the seals,

362
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,086
onto the crankshaft.      

363
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:27,425
next, the technician assembles the housing to the motor...  

364
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,827
and tests the rotation of the rotor.         

365
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,764
as the rotor turns, it forms chambers       

366
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,234
where the combustion cycle will take place.        

367
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,503
he slips a bearing and a counterweight      

368
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:43,441
onto the shaft, followed by a bell mouth.   

369
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:47,245
the exhaust cover has three ports to release gasses. 

370
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,982
the port in the center is the opening for the bell mouth.

371
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,784
the technician attaches an engine intake adaptor    

372
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,853
to the bell mouth.       

373
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,857
after the components have been secured with bolts, 

374
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,459
a dynamometer machine runs the engine        

375
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,797
and measures its performance. 

376
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,666
capable of running on a variety of fuels,     

377
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,937
this new rotary engine is ready to start powering things.
