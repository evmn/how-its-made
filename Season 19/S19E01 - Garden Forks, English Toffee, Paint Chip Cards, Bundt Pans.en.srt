narrator: the garden fork was once a very prized possession --  

4
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,125
so coveted, it was often the object of theft.      

5
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,660
that was centuries ago,    

6
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:04,596
when a family's very survival 
depended on the crops they grew.

7
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,865
today, of course,       

8
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,467
food is mass produced and sold in supermarkets.   

9
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:12,138
but the garden fork still rules
in the backyard garden.    

10
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,542
there are many versions of the trusty garden fork.   

11
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,680
use one to work the garden, and you'll reap the benefits. 

12
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,349
at this factory,        

13
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,419
they've been forging garden forks          

14
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,488
from a solid-steel slab for over two centuries.    

15
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,894
using a 660-ton punch press, they cut two basic fork shapes 

16
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,628
from this hot and malleable slab.      

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,299
the tines or prongs for this particular kind of fork  

18
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,969
are shorter than most because these are border forks 

19
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,573
used for turning soil rather than digging deep.   

20
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,176
with the basic shape now established,        

21
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:53,512
it's back into the furnace to re-soften the stem.     

22
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,782
a worker repeatedly feeds it to rollers           

23
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,584
to thin and widen it substantially.         

24
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:02,187
he strikes the stem with another punch press.   

25
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,856
this one hit trims it     

26
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,725
while cutting holes for attaching the wood shaft. 

27
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,396
the trimmings will be remelted and recycled into new forks.  

28
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,733
the next press slams the steel stem         

29
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,267
into a cylindrical die     

30
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,136
to force it into the basic shape
of a socket.          

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,806
he slides the socket onto a coned form       

32
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,809
and strikes it repeatedly to refine the socket shape.  

33
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,679
this sizes it for a wooden shaft.      

34
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:30,082
they take an entirely different approach       

35
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,284
when making digging forks   

36
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,753
because of their longer curved tines.         

37
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,889
after forging a kind of spider shape,    

38
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:40,759
a worker bends a prong around 
a post to orient it for shaping.

39
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,896
this two-person team works in tandem.        

40
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,032
one fires the spider and bends the prongs.     

41
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,636
the other worker inserts the prong in the grooves    

42
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,905
of two revolving dies.     

43
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,841
this rolls the tine within the confines of the grooves  

44
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,176
to stretch it long and thin.  

45
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,180
with two tines now shaped,   

46
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,649
his partner bends them out of the way         

47
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,252
so he can work on the third tine.       

48
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:13,391
rolling takes 18 months of training to perfect.    

49
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,528
if the tine isn't precisely aligned with the grooves,   

50
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,264
the equipment could seize and throw the worker backwards.

51
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,266
not only could he be injured, 

52
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:25,471
but the fork and the dies would
most certainly be wrecked.   

53
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:31,010
with a fourth tine now stretched
long and thin like the rest,  

54
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,412
the other member of the team twists all four tines     

55
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,614
around the post again,     

56
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,951
this time to bend them all in the same general direction. 

57
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,319
after about 10 minutes of work,

58
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,156
they have the rough shape of a digging fork.       

59
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,426
they then form the socket and crop the tines.      

60
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,461
fired to a supple state again, 

61
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,631
a worker drives tooling between the tines       

62
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,234
to straighten them and even the gaps between them.

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:01,173
he rests the fork socket against
a steel slope and lowers a ram. 

64
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:05,110
it slams into the tines to push
the socket against the slope  

65
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,378
and bend it upward --     

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
a more effective angle for digging.          

67
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,784
he inserts the tines in a press
one at a time.         

68
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:16,322
the press closes around each tine to taper the corners.

69
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:19,859
a ram now pounds the base of the tines     

70
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:23,128
against a swooped anvil to give it a gentle curve.   

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,064
he plunges the hot fork into cool water,        

72
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,268
and the shock hardens the steel.

73
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,338
the next worker grinds off any rough bits from the sides 

74
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,673
and sharpens the edges.    

75
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,276
he narrows the tips to a point,

76
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,213
and this will enable the fork to pierce solid earth.     

77
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,450
a worker repairs any irregularities with his hammer.

78
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,754
here you can see the difference this makes.   

79
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,891
the prongs on the left are out of alignment.      

80
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,292
the ones on the right have been fixed.        

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,495
they apply an electrostatic charge    

82
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,098
onto the forks to attract a green powder spray.     

83
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,102
once cured, it forms a colorful
skin that resists corrosion.  

84
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,505
now out of the curing oven,  

85
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,507
a worker clamps the ends to lock the fork in place   

86
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,911
while he inserts the ash wood shaft into the socket.

87
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,113
he secures it with rivets.   

88
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,582
using a belt sander,      

89
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:20,419
he blends the wood to the metal 
in a process known as linishing.

90
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,990
he also sands the rivets    

91
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,194
to make them flush to the surface of the metal.  

92
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,731
the bottom fork is the one that has been linished.    

93
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,669
he dips the wood shaft and handle in varnish,     

94
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,806
giving it a glossy stain that enhances the grain.    

95
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,876
this garden fork is now done. 

96
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,945
it won't look shiny and new for long,       

97
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:49,715
because things are sure to get dirty very soon.        

98
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,632
narrator: toffee is a type of candy traditionally made  

99
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,635
of caramelized sugar or molasses and butter.    

100
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,971
there are many different varieties --     

101
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,372
soft and chewy or hard and brittle.      

102
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,507
english toffee,        

103
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,043
which is actually an american style of toffee,  

104
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,177
is very buttery        

105
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,281
and typically has a topping of chopped nuts.        

106
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,718
this english toffee      

107
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
is completely free of dairy ingredients      

108
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:31,256
and is kosher certified, making it ideal        

109
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:35,193
for toffee lovers with certain dietary restrictions. 

110
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,797
the workers at this small american confectioner  

111
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,000
make this special recipe entirely by hand        

112
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,203
one small batch at a time.   

113
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:47,539
they start by combining water and sugar.        

114
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,675
they heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves.   

115
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,811
then they add a formula so top-secret         

116
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,346
they won't let us see it.   

117
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,548
all they'll reveal is that it contains      

118
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,418
a combination of vegetable oils
and shortening         

119
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,821
which are non-dairy substitutes
for butter and beta carotene  

120
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,158
to give the toffee that familiar golden color.  

121
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,028
they add an emulsifier called lecithin        

122
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,563
to stabilize all these ingredients.     

123
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:15,167
as soon as the mixture reaches the boiling point,   

124
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,301
they add salt.         

125
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,903
this enhances the flavor    

126
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,974
and helps produce a rapid boil 
that continues for several hours

127
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:25,577
until the mixture hits     
a top-secret target temperature.

128
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,848
by that point, most of the water
has evaporated,        

129
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,786
producing sweet, thick, liquid toffee.         

130
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,522
now they open a hot-water valve
that heats up a table,     

131
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,826
then carefully pour the toffee onto the surface.       

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,002
the heat keeps the toffee pliable    

133
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,071
while they spread it out.   

134
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,074
they spread it wider and wider 

135
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,610
until the toffee sheet is evenly thick.        

136
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,412
they don't actually measure.  

137
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:04,749
they just eyeball it, so the thickness varies somewhat. 

138
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,885
but that lack of uniformity  

139
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,155
is part of the charm of handmade sweets.       

140
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:13,558
they take a tool with multiple cutting wheels  

141
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,494
spaced about two inches apart. 

142
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,730
they run it over the toffee sheet in one direction, 

143
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,166
then in the other.       

144
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,038
then they shut off the hot-water valve      

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,108
and open the cold-water one to cool the table surface   

146
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,312
and harden what are now toffee squares.        

147
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:39,218
within minutes, the squares are
hard enough to be broken apart.

148
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,457
next, the first of two ingredients       

149
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,259
that will turn this into english toffee --     

150
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,064
molten semi-sweet chocolate.  

151
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,398
once this tempering machine  

152
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,334
heats it to the right consistency,   

153
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,536
a pump feeds it to the enrobing machine    

154
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,539
that coats the toffee squares in two stages,         

155
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,541
starting on the bottom.    

156
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,753
the underside now coated,   

157
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,489
the squares move on to a refrigerated belt.    

158
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,959
the cold quickly hardens the chocolate.         

159
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,295
then they move into the next station        

160
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,698
which covers the top with chocolate.        

161
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,639
as the now fully-coated squares
exit the enrobing machine,   

162
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:39,311
the belt vibrates, shaking off the excess chocolate.     

163
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,722
the squares move on to another refrigerated belt  

164
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,724
and a worker manually sprinkles them    

165
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,192
with the second ingredient   

166
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,928
that makes this english toffee --       

167
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,230
chopped pecans.        

168
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,340
the squares travel through a cooling tunnel        

169
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,476
for several minutes to set.  

170
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,546
as they reach the end of the line,      

171
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,350
excess nuts drop off and collect in a pan below,  

172
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,620
ready for sprinkling onto new squares.       

173
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:32,430
some english toffee recipes call
for almonds rather than pecans. 

174
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,233
whichever variety of nut,   

175
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,969
every recipe follows the same structure.       

176
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,971
layering sweet and crunchy toffee,   

177
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,710
smooth and creamy chocolate, and coarsely chopped nuts --  

178
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,646
three different textures, tastes, and sensations     

179
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,249
brought together in a single confection.    

180
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,586
and just like other decadently delicious desserts, 

181
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,655
english toffee is heaven    

182
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,124
to anyone with a serious sweet tooth.  

183
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,075
narrator: trying to decide on a paint color?       

184
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,412
each card is a small sample of related shades,       

185
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,881
allowing you to view the actual hues    

186
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,951
without prying off the lids of paint cans.         

187
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,154
with thousands of shades to choose from,        

188
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,124
how do they get it all down on paper?         

189
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,431
whether you're looking for a brilliant blue      

190
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,832
or a marvelous mauve,     

191
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,102
careful scrutiny of paint chip cards can help you get it right

192
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,505
before the paint hits the wall.

193
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,376
highly concentrated colorants stored in tanks        

194
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,712
will be used to reproduce paint colors in lacquer    

195
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,449
similar to the kind used in nail polish.      

196
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,052
lacquer produces better results
on paper than actual paint.  

197
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,523
they pipe the colorants to a dispenser.        

198
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,991
at the same time,       

199
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,526
a bucket containing lacquer heads toward it.        

200
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,328
the dispenser has many tentacles

201
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,198
with nozzles at the end of each one     

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,935
and each tentacle is connected to one of the colorant tanks.  

203
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,138
a computerized mechanism grabs the nozzles          

204
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,540
to dispense different colorants

205
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,210
following a specific paint-color formula.

206
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:26,945
the bucket sits on a scale   

207
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,748
and the weight is constantly monitored by the computer   

208
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,418
to confirm that exact amounts are being added.        

209
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,088
a blender mixes the colorants in the lacquer.        

210
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,957
the mixing speed and time have been preset        

211
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,427
to avoid over or under mixing. 

212
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,164
and now for the color test.  

213
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,834
a technician pulls a bit of the lacquer-based paint   

214
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,038
on a sheet of paper just under a steel bar.    

215
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,377
using that bar, he spreads the color evenly across the paper. 

216
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,047
then it's into a kind of moving convection oven     

217
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,682
to dry the color.       

218
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:09,921
the technician compares the color and gloss      

219
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,790
to that of the standard.    

220
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,059
he also does a computer analysis

221
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:19,064
and sends the formula back for tweaking when necessary.  

222
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,933
once they perfect the hue and gloss,       

223
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,070
production is ready to roll.  

224
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,272
a worker pours the approved lacquer-based paints      

225
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,343
into cylindrical tanks above the coating machine.   

226
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,079
there are over two dozen of these tanks         

227
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,547
because they'll be putting that many colors on paper    

228
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,483
in one production run.     

229
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,752
he connects plastic tubing to the tanks          

230
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,489
to narrow the flow and aim it at the die block below.    

231
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,158
he activates the machine    

232
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,495
and adjusts the tension of the paper as it moves forward. 

233
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,899
lacquer flows into a die,   

234
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:57,168
coating the paper with an endless rainbow of color.  

235
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,904
a bar overhead spreads the lacquer evenly       

236
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,175
without actually touching the paper.           

237
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,780
the striped paper then travels through an oven. 

238
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,314
the solvents evaporate,    

239
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,117
leaving a dried lacquer skin on the paper.         

240
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,986
if regular paint had been used,

241
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,055
the paper would have absorbed it
and ended up wavy.       

242
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,126
but with the lacquer paint, it remains flat.        

243
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:25,397
rotary blades cut the coated paper        

244
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,532
into sheets sized to fit printing machinery   

245
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,599
down the line.         

246
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,536
they land in a neat stack.   

247
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,206
using a transparent template, 

248
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,944
the next worker measures the width of each stripe.   

249
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,280
he then confirms that the colors
are in the correct order    

250
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,350
by checking each stripe against the approved proofs.  

251
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,290
he checks the gloss with a glossmeter.       

252
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,161
it aims light on an angle and registers the reflection  

253
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:59,297
to confirm that the gloss is consistent.         

254
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,499
with the okay from the tester, 

255
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,302
the entire production run receives the go-ahead.     

256
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,637
the press operator stacks them facedown            

257
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,706
for loading into the printer. 

258
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,576
a feeder serves up the striped sheets       

259
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,246
to the printing line one at a time.         

260
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,647
it's a 4-station printing press.

261
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,117
each cylinder is equipped   
with an ink of a different color

262
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,188
to stand out against the various paint-card stripes.

263
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,991
they print the paint color names
and numbers on both sides.   

264
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,195
they also apply varnish to the back of the sheets   

265
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,864
so the paint chip cards won't stick to one another   

266
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,265
when stacked.         

267
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:39,037
named and numbered, the color stripes are now identifiable. 

268
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,275
the sheets go under a guillotine blade       

269
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,877
which slices them into paint chip cards.     

270
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,880
powered by hydraulics and super sharp,        

271
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,918
the blade cuts through hundreds
of paper sheets like butter.  

272
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:58,089
they produce 3 1/2 million paint chip cards a day     

273
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,559
at this factory.        

274
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,428
with so many options,     

275
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,898
the cards are stacked against a quick decision.   

276
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,384
narrator: a bundt pan     

277
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,053
is for baking a dense,     
ring-shaped cake called a bundt.

278
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,390
it typically has a fluted or a swirl design.  

279
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,593
it originated in europe hundreds of years ago     

280
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,331
and quite possibly gets its name
from the german bundkuchen -- 

281
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,866
"kuchen" meaning "cake"    

282
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,535
and "bund" meaning "a gathering of people."    

283
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,939
bundt pans were originally ceramic,    

284
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,809
which is fragile, or cast iron, which is heavy. 

285
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,413
today's version is typically made of cast aluminum --    

286
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,349
unbreakable and infinitely lighter.    

287
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,485
it also has a nonstick coating.

288
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,088
at the factory, they begin the production process     

289
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:08,293
by melting ingots of recycled aluminum.     

290
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,429
the furnace heats the ingots to 1,300-degrees fahrenheit,  

291
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,966
at which point, they liquify in about a minute.

292
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,901
from the melting furnace,   

293
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,104
workers transfer the molten aluminum      

294
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,438
to a holding furnace      

295
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,909
which keeps it in a liquid state
until casting.         

296
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,046
the casting process is entirely automated.     

297
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,448
a ladle descends into the holding furnace    

298
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,119
and scoops up just over two pounds of aluminum,    

299
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,454
enough to make one bundt pan. 

300
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,991
the ladle then pours the molten metal into a sleeve 

301
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,060
which a high-speed ram immediately pushes       

302
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,397
into a steel bundt-pan mold.  

303
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,932
the pressure and speed combined

304
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,602
shoot the molten aluminum into every nook and cranny   

305
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,137
of the mold cavity.      

306
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,039
as the hot aluminum hits the cooler mold,     

307
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,742
it solidifies in about 10 seconds,      

308
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,212
then the two halves of the mold automatically separate

309
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:04,516
and a robotic arm extracts the cast pan.         

310
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,354
between castings, a robot cleans the mold    

311
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,423
with a blast of air, water, and lubricant.         

312
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,693
this removes any aluminum residue,     

313
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,295
leaving the mold surface pristine.           

314
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:21,899
this is critical, because even 
a tiny speck of dust left behind

315
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,035
would mar the next casting.  

316
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,971
as each pan comes off the machine,          

317
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:30,175
workers inspect it for any casting flaws.     

318
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,513
when it comes time to produce a different style bundt pan,  

319
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,182
like this one with six mini-cake forms,   

320
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,251
they simply mount the corresponding mold     

321
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,253
onto the casting machine.   

322
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,588
as the machine fills the mold under pressure,    

323
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,393
some aluminum oozes out between
the two halves of the mold.  

324
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,795
now a worker cuts off that excess          

325
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,264
with a single strike of a trim press.        

326
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:57,936
the scrap pieces go back into the furnace to be remelted.  

327
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:02,807
next, a computer-guided router working two pans at a time,  

328
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,111
smoothes the rough edges.   

329
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,453
then it refines the handle slots, finalizing the shape.  

330
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,160
the aluminum surface must be pristine        

331
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,763
for the nonstick coating to adhere properly,      

332
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:30,101
so the pans now go through   
an industrial washing machine --

333
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,370
one wash and three rinse cycles,

334
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:36,541
and then, before exiting, a drying cycle.        

335
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:42,046
workers put the pans upside down
on fixtures          

336
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,383
which travel down the exterior coasting line.  

337
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,722
as the pan spins by, spray guns apply        

338
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,860
a silicone-based decorative coating to the outside surface.

339
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,534
the pans then travel through an oven for 15 minutes     

340
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,536
to cure the coating.      

341
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,007
then the workers flip the pans right-side up         

342
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,675
and place them on fixtures,  

343
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,478
which spin them through another spray line.  

344
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,113
this time, to coat the inside. 

345
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,752
the interior coating      

346
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:24,622
is a food-safe silicone-polyester material  

347
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,758
designed to release the cake easily from the pan.      

348
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,828
it's similar to a nonstick coating on a fry pan, 

349
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,498
the difference being that the chemical composition 

350
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,167
is designed to prevent sugar, rather than protein,      

351
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,169
from sticking.         

352
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:42,373
again, the pans go through an oven for 15 minutes     

353
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,776
to cure the coating.      

354
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,117
once the finished pans exit the oven,         

355
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,119
workers inspect them thoroughly,

356
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,655
checking for any flaws in the coatings.        

357
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:01,726
from a practical perspective, a bundt pan's ringed shape   

358
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:05,396
has definite advantages over an ordinary baking pan.  

359
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,132
the tube in the middle     

360
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,467
funnels heat to the center of the cake batter,      

361
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,470
helping it bake quicker and more thoroughly.      

362
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,539
from a decorative perspective, 

363
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,942
when you compare an ordinary pan
to an elegant bundt,      

364
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,445
the latter certainly takes the cake.   

365
