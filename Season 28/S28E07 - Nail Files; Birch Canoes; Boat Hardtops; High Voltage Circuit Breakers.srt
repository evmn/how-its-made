00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:26,358
           narrator:            
  today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,594
       metal nail files.        

5
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,999
      birch bark canoes.        

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,005
    cruiser boat hardtops.      

7
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,845
        and high-voltage        
       circuit breakers.        

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,821
      throughout history,       
people have wanted nice nails.  

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,858
     and they used whatever     
 they could get their hands on  

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,593
    to make them look good.     

11
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,629
   marie antoinette is said to  
              have              
   used a pumice stone file     

12
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,831
   to shape her fingernails.    

13
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,100
     by the end of the 19th     
            century,            

14
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,669
        metal nail files        
       became the norm.         

15
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,509
        metal nail files        
     can be used to grind       

16
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,846
     and shape fingernails      
      with a few strokes.       

17
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:25,951
    their abrasiveness is the   
             secret             
     to their popularity.       

18
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,553
making metal nail files starts  

19
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,855
       with a thick spool       
      of stainless steel.       

20
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,895
       the steel unwinds        
       at a steady pace.        

21
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,732
      a punch press wields      
 88 tons of hydraulic pressure  

22
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,669
 to cut out nail file blanks.   

23
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:50,775
  the blanks spill into a bin   
        and accumulate.         

24
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,313
    the blanks bounce around    
      with ceramic stones       

25
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,882
       and a mix of water       
    and polishing solution.     

26
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,551
  this smoothes the rough bits  
         on the blanks          

27
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,620
     and also cleans them.      

28
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:06,191
    the nail file blanks then   
              slide             
  down a chute into a dryer.    

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,665
     this dryer doesn't use     
    hot air to do the job.      

30
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,269
   instead, a pulsating mass    
       of hot corn grain        

31
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,205
 soaks up the lingering liquid  
        on the blanks.          

32
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,208
      as the blanks exit,       
    some of the corn falls      

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,011
 through a perforated conveyor  
         to be reused.          

34
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,815
     the blanks continue on     
      and land in a bin,        

35
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,985
    ready for the next phase    
        of production.          

36
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:37,489
   it involves the cutting of   
    an abrasive grid on both    
             sides.             

37
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,724
  it's a three-stage process.   

38
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,228
   first, a worker places the   
              blank             
      under a sharp tool        

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,697
 that's angled at 52 degrees.   

40
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,801
   the tool pounds the blank    
          repeatedly            

41
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:51,770
to cut angled grooves into it.  

42
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,574
   here is the blank before     

43
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,677
   and after the first cut.     

44
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,180
 he switches the cutting tool,  

45
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,316
  and it carves over the first  
  cuts on the opposite angle.   

46
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,292
  the third cut goes straight   
     across the other two.      

47
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,762
     the ridges and valleys     
   created by the cross cuts    

48
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,598
 make the surface of the blank  
            sharp.              

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,134
   the grid cutting has bent    

50
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:25,303
    the still-pliable steel     
         out of shape,          

51
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,540
   so the worker now bends the  
              nail              
      files in the opposite     
           direction,           

52
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,443
using a round form as a guide.  

53
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,346
         this restores          
     their linear profile.      

54
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,751
      the carving process       
has also caused steel to bulge  

55
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,952
    on the edges of the nail    
             files,             

56
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,490
   so he grinds them against    
 a fine abrasive sanding belt   

57
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,525
    to make the edges smooth    
             again.             

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,066
        next, he places         
     the metal nail files       

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,070
    in perfect alignment in a   
             tray.              

60
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,741
 he transfers the tray of files 
          to an oven.           

61
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,312
  the files bake for an hour    

62
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,749
      at a temperature of       
   1,832 degrees fahrenheit.    

63
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,550
   the intense heat begins to   
             alter              

64
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,753
    the physical properties     
         of the steel           

65
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,289
   and is the first phase of    
     a hardening process.       

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,926
     when the hour is up,       

67
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,428
   he takes the red-hot tray    
         of nail files          

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,963
  out of the oven using tongs   

69
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:29,635
     and then immerses them     
  in a vat of cold saltwater.   

70
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,704
   this is called quenching.    

71
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,074
    the shock of the quench     
     completes the hardening    
            process.            

72
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,211
   shielded by an enclosure,    

73
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:42,314
  he sandblasts each nail file  
       to remove stains         

74
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,850
 left by the hardening process  

75
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,487
  and to make the steel around  
 the triple-cut grid shinier.   

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,824
      he places the handle      
      into the nail file        

77
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,360
  beneath a plastic stencil.    

78
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,664
    a stamp applies acid to     
 the open areas of the stencil  

79
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,733
   to etch brand information    
           onto it.             

80
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:05,570
        some nail files         
     have plastic handles.      

81
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,172
     to make the handles,       

82
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,743
   this machine melts plastic   
  and injects it into molds.    

83
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,046
the handles are stuck together  

84
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,149
     by hardened flow lines     
          or runners.           

85
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,153
      a few tumbles in this     
            revolving           
 drum knocks off the runners,   

86
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:25,723
     separating the handles     
          from them.            

87
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,093
 the worker places each handle  
   under an automated printing  
              head              

88
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,330
 that soaks up ink from a pad   

89
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,966
     and then stamps brand      
 information onto the plastic.  

90
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,305
  another worker heats the end  
    of each metal nail file     

91
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,974
    using copper elements.      

92
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,712
   she inserts the hot metal    
   into the plastic sleeve,     

93
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,882
 and the plastic melts a little 
     to bond to the metal.      

94
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,921
     these metal nail files     
   are ready for the grind.     

95
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,838
    narrator: for centuries,    
  the canoe was indispensable   

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,842
    to the indigenous people    
       of north america.        

97
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,579
     essential for hunting,     
            fishing,            
 transportation, and commerce,  

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,516
     indigenous people often    
             crafted            
 their canoes from birch bark,  

99
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:28,887
 which is lightweight, strong,  
waterproof, and rot-resistant.  

100
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,858
         historically,          
  different indigenous tribes   

101
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,862
  constructed different styles  
     of birch bark canoes.      

102
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,630
  this one is the type crafted  
               by               

103
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,766
      both the algonquian       
      and eastern ojibwe.       

104
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:46,404
 even today, the canoe builder  
    crafts every component      

105
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,640
 from water- and rot-resistant  
        plant materials         

106
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,009
     found in the forest,       

107
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:56,248
    such as the exceptionally   
             strong             
 roots of black spruce trees.   

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,716
  after scraping off the bark   

109
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,952
    with a tool crafted from    
         a moose rib,           

110
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:03,889
  this craftswoman cuts a slit  
     in the top and pulls,      

111
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:07,392
    splitting the long root     
       into two strips.         

112
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,763
    she coils up each strip     
 and puts it aside to dry out.  

113
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,365
       the canoe builder        
       uses spruce root         

114
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,401
 to bind structural components  

115
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,972
       and lace together        
    sections of birch bark.     

116
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,240
      to build the canoe's      
       cedar structure,         

117
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,910
    the builder connects end    
             frames             
     at the front and back      

118
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,645
   with long strips of cedar    
       called gunwales,         

119
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,649
    then he lashes crossbars    
        called thwarts          

120
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,485
        to the gunwales         
       with spruce root.        

121
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,153
    to make each end frame,     

122
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,257
   he splits a piece of cedar   
  many times to let it bend,    

123
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,693
   soaks it in boiling water    
  to soften the wood fibers,    

124
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,463
      and binds the shape       
       with spruce root.        

125
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:48,433
  then the builder checks this  
 curved part, called the stem,  

126
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,169
   against the straight part,   
     called the headboard.      

127
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,905
 if the proportions are right,  

128
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,041
     he notches the bottom      
       of the headboard         

129
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,909
      to fit over the base      
         of the stem,           

130
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,947
    then lashes the parts to    
 each other with spruce root.   

131
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,283
       he laces together        
 several pieces of birch bark   

132
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,253
  to make a sheet large enough  
        for the canoe.          

133
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,556
   the builder saturates the    
 bark sheet with boiling water  

134
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,959
        and bends it up         
   around a wooden template.    

135
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,294
    then, on each side of the   
             canoe,             

136
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,563
   he sandwiches the top edge   
          of the bark           

137
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:23,135
    in between the two cedar    
             strips             
    that form the gunwale.      

138
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,536
       the builder shaves       
        pieces of cedar         

139
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,905
       to make straight,        
    vertically laid planks      

140
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,842
          and u-shaped          
    horizontally laid ribs      

141
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,178
      that line the inside      
         of the canoe.          

142
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,147
 he uses a gauge to make sure   

143
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,282
           each piece           
  is the required thickness.    

144
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,787
     he lays each rib piece     
     across the structure       

145
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,923
 and makes a mark on each side  

146
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,360
  in line with the bottom edge  
         of the floor.          

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,096
          that's where          
     he'll bend the piece.      

148
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:56,568
   just as he did to bend the   
              stem              
   portion of the end frame,    

149
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,371
   the builder ladles boiling   
              water             
         onto the wood          

150
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,006
     to soften the fibers.      

151
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,816
     he positions his knees     
     on the charcoal marks      

152
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,285
    and pulls up the ends.      

153
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,289
 he bends two ribs at a time,   

154
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,226
  as this reduces the chances   
       of them cracking.        

155
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,669
   after checking that he cut   
      and bent all the ribs     
           correctly,           

156
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:36,440
 the builder begins the process 
  of securing the birch bark.   

157
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,512
     he drills holes in the     
            gunwales            
 at nearly six-inch intervals.  

158
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,716
       then he takes pegs       
     carved from hardwood       

159
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,684
     such as ash or maple       

160
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,653
        and hammers one         
      through each hole.        

161
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,294
     then he pierces holes      
       through the bark         

162
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,097
     with a traditional awl     
    made from deer antler.      

163
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,902
     he threads spruce root     
       through the holes        

164
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,738
     to lash the bark to the    
            gunwale.            

165
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,847
   with an assistant's help,    

166
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,184
    he fully lines the canoe    
  with straight cedar planks    

167
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,220
   and installs the remaining   
             ribs.              

168
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,457
    the tight fit presses the   
             planks             
       against the bark,        

169
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,994
     stretching it taught,      
     which strengthens it.      

170
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,131
   the final step is known as   
      pitching the seams.       

171
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,467
   he melts down dried resin    

172
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,669
      gathered from scars       
        on spruce trees         

173
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,472
  and mixes in two ingredients  
               --               

174
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,007
        ground charcoal         

175
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,275
   and oil rendered from bear   
              fat.              

176
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,977
  he applies this hot mixture   

177
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,080
    to all the lacing holes     
      in the birch bark,        

178
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,983
 making the canoe water-tight.  

179
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,120
      the canoeist carries      
 a small supply of dried pitch  

180
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,957
  and lights a stick to remelt  
         and apply it.          

181
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,659
   the repair dries quickly,    

182
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,928
   so in about five minutes,    

183
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,197
      the canoeist can be       
      back in the paddle.       

184
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,249
  narrator: a hardtop encloses  
the cockpit of a cruiser boat.  

185
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,886
      it provides shelter       
   from water spray, wind, and  
              sun,              

186
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,421
     and a roof on which to     
   mount antenna for marine     

187
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,990
 and satellite radio and gps.   

188
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,660
         on the inside,         
     it provides walls and a    
            ceiling             

189
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:38,430
     for recessed lighting      
      and other features.       

190
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,534
    this cruiser hardtop has    
            windows             

191
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,069
   that wrap around the front   
          and sides.            

192
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,506
   the tall one in the middle   
        is retractable          

193
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:50,641
    so you can walk through     
      to the front deck.        

194
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,745
 workers use two molds to make  
   the inner and outer parts    

195
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,714
    that form the hardtop.      

196
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,449
     first, they spray white    
            gelcoat             

197
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,786
       to a thickness of        
     just .6 millimeters.       

198
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:06,524
  next, workers shoot shredded  
   fiberglass strands into the  
              mold              

199
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:10,262
  along with a stream of resin  
  which saturates the fibers.   

200
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,664
  when the fiberglass is about  
     3/4 of an inch thick,      

201
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,636
    they let the resin cure     
      for an hour or so.        

202
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:20,672
   then workers apply bonding   
              putty             
       to the fiberglass        

203
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,340
      in the outer mold.        

204
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,947
      they mate the inner       
        and outer molds         

205
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,281
    and let the putty set,      

206
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,150
  which takes about an hour.    

207
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,624
 finally, it's time to extract  
the fiberglass from the molds.  

208
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,759
it comes off relatively easily  

209
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,129
   because prior to spraying    
      the gelcoat layer,        

210
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,098
 workers have applied a release 
 agent on the mold's surface.   

211
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:53,037
 the inner and outer parts are  
 built in the mold upside-down  

212
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,041
      so the gelcoat gives      
     the coarse fiberglass      

213
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,010
       a smooth and shiny       
        surface finish.         

214
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,884
     then they cut openings     
        for the windows         

215
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,285
and for the various components  

216
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,821
        to be installed         
       into the hardtop.        

217
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,660
          they install          
 the retractable front window.  

218
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,798
    workers then position the   
             window             
   and mark the screw holes,    

219
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,168
         then remove it         
  in order to apply adhesive,   

220
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,169
      which also functions      
         as a sealant           

221
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,605
to prevent water infiltration.  

222
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,443
     they reset the window      
 and screw it to the hardtop.   

223
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,946
        workers install         
     a non-opening window       

224
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,116
          on each side          
    of the retractable one.     

225
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:42,254
   after taping off the area,   
   a worker applies primer.     

226
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,024
     once the primer dries,     
     they remove the tape       

227
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,227
  and apply an adhesive-backed  
          foam gasket           

228
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,397
  that's about 1/4-inch high.   

229
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,407
   a worker applies a 1/4-inch  
              high              
   bead of adhesive sealant     

230
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:07,379
       next to the gasket       
     and sets the window.       

231
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,686
       the primer gasket        
     and adhesive sealant       

232
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,489
         are all black          
  to match the window frame.    

233
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,963
  on the roof of the hardtop,   

234
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,333
     workers install a thin     
   molded fiberglass cover.     

235
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,142
    the retractable window,     
 when opened, slides under it.  

236
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,678
     workers fill the gap       

237
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,380
 between the cover and hardtop  
         with sealant.          

238
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,285
     this adheres the cover     
   and makes it watertight.     

239
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,821
  at the rear, workers install  
        the radar arch.         

240
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,525
     this, too, is made of      
       molded fiberglass        

241
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,461
    but with a black gelcoat    
            finish.             

242
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,963
 they mount various components  
            on it,              

243
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,733
       such as the horn,        
navigation light, and antenna.  

244
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,468
      inside the hardtop,       

245
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,604
      after passing wires       
         for lighting,          

246
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,741
   workers connect the wiring   
  to the retractable window.    

247
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,278
        the window comes        
   as a self-contained unit     

248
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,514
   with an incorporated motor   
 and intricate pulley system.   

249
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:22,153
 the hardtop is now ready to be 
mounted to the cruiser's deck.  

250
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,791
        workers install         
      a windshield wiper        

251
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,394
      on each non-opening       
         front window.          

252
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,933
  the last step is to install   
        a large window          

253
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,302
 on both sides of the hardtop.  

254
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,538
   its middle section opens.    

255
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,274
   like a giant windshield,     

256
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,677
     the hardtop transforms     
      the cruiser boat's        

257
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,611
    otherwise open cockpit      

258
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,315
    into a weather-protected    
            lounge.             

259
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,733
              265               

260
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,773
      narrator: electrical      
           substations          
   play a critical role in the  
              grid              

261
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,510
 as they distribute electricity 
    to entire communities.      

262
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,411
      the circuit breakers      
       at these stations        

263
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,347
      routinely interrupt       
        short circuits          

264
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,249
    to prevent damage to the    
            system.             

265
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,683
they perform the same function  

266
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,885
         as the ones in         
   a home electrical panel,     

267
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,454
  but on a much larger scale.   

268
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,158
       the size of a car        
    or even a large truck,      

269
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,860
     these circuit breakers     
         troubleshoot           

270
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,430
    high-current situations     
  at electrical substations.    

271
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,468
     this protects the grid     
  and prevents power outages.   

272
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,071
     making one starts with     
     a cast-aluminum tank       

273
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,241
      that has receptacles      
         for bushings.          

274
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,578
   a worker inspects the tank   
       for dirt or flaws        

275
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,279
        and then places         
       protective covers        

276
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,348
  on the bushing receptacles.   

277
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,585
       he installs bases        
   for current transformers     

278
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,954
     on these receptacles.      

279
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,557
  the worker applies adhesive   

280
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,260
         to the outside         
     of these metal bases.      

281
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:13,131
 he presses squares of plastic  
insulation to the glued areas.  

282
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,702
         with the help          
     of an overhead lift,       

283
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,171
      the worker installs       
 the two current transformers   

284
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,341
    on the insulated bases.     

285
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,277
   these current transformers   
     will act as sensors,       

286
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,879
  enabling the circuit breaker  
   to detect short circuits     

287
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,083
    in an electrical system     
     in mere milliseconds.      

288
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,489
     another worker brushes     
           lubricant            

289
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,190
       on the moving part       
      of the interrupter        

290
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,493
 that will break the electrical 
     current when needed.       

291
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,862
  he inserts the exhaust tube   

292
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,434
 that helps direct the flow of  
gas used to break the current.  

293
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,969
he sets the interrupter module  

294
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,370
     in an upright position     
         on the floor           

295
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,174
 and returns to the workbench.  

296
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:59,176
  the worker dabs thread lock   
 liquid in the mounting holes   

297
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,745
       of the stationary        
       contact assembly         

298
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,616
   and installs a resin ring    
         in the base.           

299
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,520
 he inserts the stationary part 
     into the moving one,       

300
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,689
  leaving the end protruding.   

301
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,892
the worker applies thread lock  

302
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,193
     to the assembly holes      
        of a large tube         

303
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,096
        that will shield        
    the entire interrupter      

304
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,198
   once it's installed in the   
             tank.              

305
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,602
  it will also direct the flow  
     of interrupting gas.       

306
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,937
      after assembling it       
      to the interrupter,       

307
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,707
     he inserts a synthetic     
       insulating tube.         

308
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,243
 then with the help of a lift,  

309
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,644
   he flips the module over     

310
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,848
          in order to           
    work on the other end.      

311
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,588
      he installs another       
 insulating tube in this end.   

312
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,092
    he then sets the module     
    to a stand to steady it     

313
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,427
         as he inserts          
     the contact assembly       

314
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,931
    that opens to interrupt     
    the electrical current.     

315
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,470
        he caps one end         
      of the interrupter        

316
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,606
   with the unit that houses    
        the bell crank.         

317
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,812
    he slides the bell crank    
       into the housing.        

318
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,416
    this crank will convert     
       the rotary motion        

319
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,385
  from the operating mechanism  
      to a linear motion.       

320
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:19,424
 he turns the crank to confirm  
    that it rotates freely.     

321
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,863
      he now clamps leads       
        to test probes          

322
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,498
  inserted in the interrupter   

323
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,035
     and applies 100 amps of    
            current.            

324
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,904
  the testing device measures   
 the interrupter's resistance   

325
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,205
to the current to confirm that  

326
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,308
          it's within           
     an acceptable range.       

327
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,612
 with a lift bearing the load,  

328
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,182
  the other member of the team  
 guides the interrupter module  

329
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,852
 into the cast-aluminum tank.   

330
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,456
   he bolts the bell crank's    
  housing to the tank opening   

331
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,191
     and places cylindrical     
      electrical shields        

332
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,561
           in each of           
   the bushing receptacles.     

333
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,033
       he then encases the      
          transformers          
          at the base           

334
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,869
     with aluminum covers.      

335
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,770
        they'll protect         
    the transformer wiring      

336
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,873
   from rain, snow, or dirt.    

337
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,510
      lifts now hoist the       
     silicone-rubber-wrapped    
            bushings            

338
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,579
     into the receptacles.      

339
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,417
     the worker bolts them      
          in place...           

340
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,990
      ...and caps the rear      
         of the tank.           

341
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,028
 this interrupter is now ready  

342
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,697
         to be mounted          
      to the steel support      
           structure.           

343
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,166
       each high-voltage        
        circuit breaker         

344
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:39,203
        will be equipped        
   with three interrupters.     

345
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,205
       the team connects        
        the bell cranks         

346
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,008
    to the operating system     
    in the control cabinet.     

347
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:51,015
  and workers equip each bell   
 crank with a pressure gauge.   

348
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,485
        a worker grounds        
      the circuit breaker       

349
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,920
    to the support structure    
      with copper cables.       

350
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,124
    this will prevent shocks    
   to anyone who touches it.    

351
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,061
       in one last test,        

352
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:06,030
     towering transformers      
      apply high voltages       

353
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,099
   to the circuit breakers.     

354
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,234
       these high-voltage       
       circuit breakers         

355
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,736
          are ready to          
     interrupt situations       

356
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,838
 before they become problems.
