            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,759
            levels...           

3
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,998
         ...hot dogs...         

4
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,038
      ...abrasive grain...      

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,177
        ...and sandpaper.

      captions paid for by      
  discovery communications, llc 

8
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,187
     the level was invented     
       in the 17th century      

9
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,790
       to keep structures       
         plumb and true.        

10
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,859
           without it,          
      buildings would lean,     

11
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,394
    floors would be crooked,    

12
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,798
 and maps would have inaccurate 
     elevation information.     

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,466
  no matter what you're making, 

14
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,536
       this critical tool       
always gives it to you straight.

15
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,812
  it's a centuries-old concept, 
     but still measures up.     

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,949
    center the little bubble,   
 and you're perfectly straight. 

17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,755
 production begins with a length
     of laminated birchwood.    

18
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,692
       an automated router      
    carves out several holes,   

19
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,362
         three of which         
     will enclose the vials.    

20
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,265
          the other two         
    will serve as handgrips.    

21
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,008
         next, it's time        
 to tackle the wood's perimeter.

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,914
         grooves are cut        
  along the length of the wood  

23
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,449
 for the level's brass binding. 

24
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:04,422
   strips of brass are unwound  
     into a forming machine.    

25
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:09,061
    rollers iron out the curl   
        from the coiling.       

26
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:12,731
          other rollers         
      then crimp the brass.     

27
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,666
     this process will allow    
            the strip           

28
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,002
    to fit into those grooves   
          in the wood.          

29
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,546
    lengths of brass binding    

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,815
    are loaded into a machine   
  that slides them into place.  

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,418
         this reinforces        
     the edges of the wood.     

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,156
    over at another station,    

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,427
   a machine melts and molds    
   the plastic for the vials.   

34
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,763
            each one            
    is slightly curved inside   

35
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,700
          so the bubble         
       has a place to sit.      

36
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,171
    the vials wind their way    
   through a vibratory feeder.  

37
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,175
   it takes them to a gripper   

38
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,512
      that rotates each one     
    so the open end faces up.   

39
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,383
        in goes a squirt        
   of yellow mineral spirits,   

40
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,020
    leaving just enough room    
      for a bubble to form.     

41
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,561
  a robotic arm plugs the vials 
       with plastic caps.       

42
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,733
     then this sonic welder     
  melts the caps onto the vials 

43
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,336
      using high-frequency      
          sound waves.          

44
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,406
  now it's time for inspection. 

45
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,541
          a tiny camera         
     photographs the bubble     

46
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,542
      and sends the picture     
          to a computer         

47
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,746
   that makes sure the bubbles  
       are the right size.      

48
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,348
    for this production run,    

49
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,284
      the bubble should be      
    about half an inch wide.    

50
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,486
      if it's on the mark,      

51
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,589
          the computer          
   allows the vial to move on.  

52
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,768
    a printer then hot-stamps   
 centering marks onto the vial. 

53
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,574
      but this spirit vial      
 isn't quite ready for business.

54
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,778
     first it needs to bake     
          for 24 hours.         

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,580
   the heat exposes any flaws,  

56
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,183
     and the defective vials    
          are rejected.         

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,055
     the vial is illuminated    
     with a bright red light    

58
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,858
       as it slowly spins       
        between rollers.        

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,393
a camera photographs the bubble,

60
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,864
 and a computer scans the image 
     to check for shifting.     

61
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,335
     too much shifting could    
compromise the level's accuracy.

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,275
  the vials that pass the test  
 then go on to a molding system.

63
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,145
   melted plastic is injected   
        into the crevices       

64
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,381
 to make a cradle for each vial.

65
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,823
       next, a technician       
     glues the cradled vials    

66
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,159
         in the openings        
    in the wooden framework.    

67
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,632
     this is precision work.    

68
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,134
      each vial has to sit      
        perfectly level,        

69
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,104
      so technicians rely       
      on a magnified image      

70
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,739
    to check their progress.    

71
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,044
    some vials are installed    
           vertically           

72
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,046
to gauge if the walls are plumb,

73
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,083
  while the horizontal ones let 
 you know if the floor is level.

74
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,123
     acrylic-rimmed windows     
    are fitted over the vials   

75
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,825
        to protect them.        

76
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,367
     rubber caps are screwed    
  on to both ends of the level. 

77
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,673
          and finally,          
  the trademark stamp goes on.  

78
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,747
   these levels are now ready   
  to straighten up any jobsite. 

79
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,855
 when we return, the real skinny
  on an all-american favorite.  

80
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,026
    narrator: hot dogs are      
    an all-american fare.       

81
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,563
         but most likely        
  it was german sausage makers  

82
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,298
who first came up with the idea.

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,833
   in fact, there are reports   
      of german immigrants      

84
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,369
   selling them from pushcarts  
      in new york's bowery      

85
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,971
    as far back as the 1860s.   

86
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,507
   a century and a half later,  

87
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,310
     hot dogs are still the     
 number-one treat on the street.

88
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,784
      traditional hot dogs      

89
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:29,654
       are made from a mix      
   of pork, beef, and chicken.  

90
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,724
    the cuts they start with    
    are called trimmings --     

91
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,194
  pieces of meat left over from 
  cutting steaks or pork chops. 

92
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,001
    the trimmings are ground    

93
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,604
      the same way butchers     
    chop up hamburger meat --   

94
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,574
       by pushing the cuts      
  through grated metal plates.  

95
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,621
   processed chicken trimmings  
  are added to the ground meat, 

96
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:08,627
 followed by food starch, salt, 
      and other flavorings.     

97
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,162
      these flavorings vary     

98
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,798
       depending on where       
   the hot dogs are to be sold  

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,935
   because people in different  
 regions have different tastes. 

100
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,777
 water is sprayed into the mix, 

101
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,780
    and everything is blended   
     together in a big vat.     

102
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,755
           corn syrup           
    adds a dash of sweetness.   

103
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,999
 the addition of even more water

104
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,068
        helps to disperse       
         the ingredients        

105
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,603
 and make the hot dogs juicier. 

106
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,473
         another machine        
   then purees the meat batter  

107
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,477
      into a fine emulsion      
    and vacuums out any air.    

108
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,884
 long rolls of cellulose tubing 

109
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,687
           are loaded           
   into the stuffing machine.   

110
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,825
     it pumps the meat puree    
       into these casings,      

111
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,961
           twisting it          
      every 5 1/4 inches --     

112
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,563
   the length of one hot dog.   

113
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,465
    it takes just 35 seconds    

114
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:25,270
to make a chain of hot dogs that
would span a soccer field twice.

115
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,978
           then three           
     of those hot-dog chains    

116
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,580
       are linked together      
 to make an even longer string, 

117
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,517
   and they're loaded several   
 at a time into another machine,

118
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,920
    which drapes the hot dogs   
       onto moving racks.       

119
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,722
 the process is carefully timed 

120
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,424
         so that a twist        
    always lands on the bar.    

121
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,932
  the racks shunt the hot dogs  
 through a liquid smoke shower, 

122
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,601
        then into an oven       
   with several cooking zones.  

123
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,137
        the liquid smoke        
    seeps through the casing    

124
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,606
   and adds flavor to the dogs  
          as they bake.         

125
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,612
      hot out of the oven,      

126
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,548
    these franks are drenched   
      in cold, salty water      

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,251
  to chill them in preparation  
         for packaging.         

128
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,560
   the hot dogs then file down  
      to an unloading zone.     

129
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:27,132
   here, a machine pulls them   
  off the bars onto a conveyor. 

130
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,839
 then the hot dogs slide off the
 conveyor into metal containers.

131
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,242
    if you've been wondering    

132
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,644
    about those black stripes   
         on the casings,        

133
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,246
  all is about to be revealed.  

134
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,651
     the stripe is a marker     
     attached to the casing.    

135
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,252
  the absence of a black stripe 

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,089
   means the hot dog is cooked  
    and ready for packaging.    

137
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,197
   inside the peeler machine,   

138
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,068
       a tiny knife slits       
   each casing along the top.   

139
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,204
      then steamy air blows     
 the casings right off the dogs.

140
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,010
       this machine peels       
     700 hot dogs a minute.     

141
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,750
     an inspector makes sure    

142
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,086
           the casing           
   has been completely removed  

143
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,554
  and that there are no defects 
          in the dogs.          

144
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,956
     then it's into a device    

145
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,292
         that looks like        
    a plastic bicycle chain.    

146
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,695
     the sprockets position     
   the hot dogs for packaging.  

147
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,967
    this factory manufactures   

148
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,771
 an incredible 300,000 hot dogs 
            an hour.            

149
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,907
          that's close          
   to 2 1/2 million per shift.  

150
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,844
         they really do         
  churn them out like sausages. 

151
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,512
       fire up the grill,       

152
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,449
    and a mouthwatering meal    
      is just minutes away.     

153
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,027
     up next, the hot scoop     
       on abrasive grains.      

154
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,066
  narrator: it takes true grit  
       to make sandpaper,       

155
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,667
     as in abrasive grains.     

156
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,870
     people have been using     
        abrasive minerals       

157
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,338
    to sand and polish things   
         for centuries.         

158
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,942
      today, these minerals     
    undergo heavy processing    

159
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,344
       to make the grade,       

160
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,981
       from very superfine      
         to very coarse.        

161
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,222
     whether you're working     
        on metal or wood,       

162
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,024
the right grade of abrasive grit

163
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,959
          is essential          
     for finishing the job.     

164
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,833
the factory starts with bauxite,

165
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,003
  a naturally occurring mineral 
      that resembles clay.      

166
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,440
        they add alumina,       

167
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:52,377
 a white powdery material that's
 actually derived from bauxite. 

168
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,248
  the bauxite and alumina are   
  blended with other minerals,  

169
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,617
          then released         
  into an electric arc furnace. 

170
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,323
  here, three large electrodes  
 use intense electrical current 

171
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,527
       to heat the mix to       
 over 3,600 degrees fahrenheit. 

172
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,330
          that's hotter         
     than an active volcano.    

173
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,733
      in fact, the mixture      
      looks a lot like lava     

174
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,703
      as the minerals melt      
      and blend together.       

175
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,145
       standing well back       
     and using a long ladle,    

176
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,481
   a technician takes a sample  
     for chemical analysis.     

177
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,683
      if the mix is right,      

178
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,854
 the molten minerals are emptied
      into a big steel pot.     

179
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,367
       the searing liquid       
      weighs several tons,      

180
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,604
     so a crane is needed to    
 transport it to a cooling area.

181
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,582
         24 hours later,        
   with the material hardened,  

182
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,652
      it's time to bring in     
       the wrecking ball.       

183
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,522
         it cracks open         
    the hardened concoction,    

184
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,993
    which is still quite hot    
          at the core.          

185
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,401
        the wrecking ball       
      is dropped repeatedly     

186
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,470
           to break up          
     the hardened minerals.     

187
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,945
         next, the lumps        
      of abrasive material      

188
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,416
         are transferred        
      to a conveyor system.     

189
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,990
metal-plated crushers break them
   up into fist-sized chunks.   

190
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,299
        a magnet picks up       
        any excess iron.        

191
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,568
            and then            
   it's into the roll crusher,  

192
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,738
      where iron cylinders      
    grind the chunks to bits.   

193
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,445
    workers assemble screens    
    in decreasing mesh sizes    

194
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,381
to make a kind of shaking sieve.

195
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,050
 it sifts the mineral particles 

196
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,652
       through the screen       
    with largest mesh first,    

197
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:19,190
then continues to sort the grits
in progressively smaller sizes. 

198
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,791
      for some perspective,     

199
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,461
       we placed a quarter      
 against the various mesh sizes.

200
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,997
         as you can see,        

201
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,868
 only the finest particles could
  pass through tightest weave.  

202
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,076
        the bits of grit        
    bounce across the screens   

203
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,680
    and fall into hoppers --    
 a different one for each size. 

204
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,418
the coarsest grains will be used
     for rough-sanding jobs.    

205
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,722
     the smaller the grain,     
     the finer the finish.      

206
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,495
        the finest grits        
   are virtually microscopic.   

207
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,238
   the next step is to inspect  
       the grain's shape.       

208
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,573
a sample is funneled into a cup.

209
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,243
       then it's weighed.       

210
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,179
 a higher weight means the bits 
       are densely stacked      

211
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,582
 and therefore blockish in shape
        with blunt edges.       

212
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,652
         a lower weight         
  means they're flat and sharp. 

213
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:26,590
    a different test is used    
  for the most minuscule grits. 

214
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,661
   the particles are suspended  
 in an an electrolyte solution. 

215
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,796
    then an electrical charge   
           is applied.          

216
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,733
     this allows inspectors     
 to count and evaluate the grits

217
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,268
          via computer.         

218
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,806
    now these abrasive grits    
    are ready to be packaged    

219
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,907
        and shipped out.        

220
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,218
       coming up, we'll go      
    to the sandpaper factory,   

221
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,288
  where the abrasive grits meet 
     their ultimate destiny.    

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,162
   we'll have the nitty-gritty  
      on that process next.     

223
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,705
  narrator: to make sandpaper,  
     you need a lot of grit.    

224
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,575
       there are thousands      
     of tiny abrasive grains    

225
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,043
       on a single sheet.       

226
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,378
         the whole idea         
     is to create friction.     

227
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,248
    by rubbing the sandpaper    
     against wood or metal,     

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,853
     you can remove defects     
  and create a uniform surface. 

229
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,729
   it's ironic that something   
           so abrasive          

230
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,265
 can make things look so smooth 
          and polished.         

231
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,270
   sandpaper often isn't made   
       from paper at all,       

232
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,806
  but fabric like poly cotton.  

233
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,343
    the cloth is unwound into   
a machine with a printing press.

234
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,679
          rollers lined         
      with rubber printers      

235
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,148
    stamp product information   
         onto the cloth.        

236
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,088
     the cloth then travels     
 underneath the printing press, 

237
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,958
    where more rollers apply    
    a heat-setting adhesive     

238
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,393
     to the unprinted side.     

239
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,174
 a computerized system measures 
   the density of the coating   

240
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,977
to ensure that it's been applied
           correctly.           

241
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,654
         then the cloth         
    is pulled one floor down    

242
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,790
    to the electrostatic pit.   

243
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,393
  here, the environment is kept 
        hot and humid --        

244
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,862
      perfect for applying      
         abrasive grains        

245
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,197
          to the cloth          
       electrostatically.       

246
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,534
      the grains are poured     
onto a conveyor belt in the pit.

247
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,337
  the conveyor moves the grains 
     under the rolling cloth    

248
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,008
     and between electrodes     
       and ground plates.       

249
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,810
      the system generates      
      an electrical field       

250
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,346
 that triggers a mini sandstorm.

251
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,284
         once airborne,         

252
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,154
    the abrasive grains stick   
  to the adhesive-coated cloth  

253
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,523
   and become embedded in it.   

254
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,093
   this method allows for even  
   distribution of the grains   

255
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,762
        across the cloth.       

256
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,705
     the grain-coated cloth     
    now rolls out of the pit    

257
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,375
  and back up to the main level 
         of the factory.        

258
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,050
   a technician cuts a swatch   
        of the sandpaper,       

259
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,654
then peels away layers and makes
   three different cutouts --   

260
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,723
     one of the cloth alone,    

261
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,526
      another of the cloth      
   with the adhesive coating,   

262
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:52,330
     and a third, the grain-    
   and adhesive-coated cloth.   

263
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,866
      he weighs each cutout     

264
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:58,135
  to confirm that the sandpaper 
       has been formulated      

265
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,737
   precisely to specification.  

266
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,675
   he also examines the gritty  
   surface under a microscope   

267
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,378
     to make sure the grains    
     are standing up evenly.    

268
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,751
       this production run      
       gets the go-ahead,       

269
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,353
  so workers move the sandpaper 

270
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,088
             through            
    a hundred-yard-long oven.   

271
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,759
          it has three          
    different heating zones,    

272
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,961
   each progressively hotter.   

273
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:28,332
    the increasing heat bakes   
  the grains into the adhesive. 

274
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,238
          the sandpaper         
      is now rough enough,      

275
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,574
    but it's not quite ready    
            for use.            

276
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,510
        in the next step,       

277
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,114
    a coat of resin is rolled   
    over the gritty surface,    

278
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,582
 binding the grains to the base.

279
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,719
         after the resin        
    is cured to the surface,    

280
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,056
 these jumbo rolls of sandpaper 
    are stored in a warehouse   

281
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,592
         until it's time        
    to cut them down to size.   

282
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,268
      some rolls are sliced     
        into big sheets.        

283
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,870
       these will be made       
into commercial sanding belts --

284
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,706
          the kind used         
     in heavy manufacturing.    

285
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,518
         another machine        
   punches out sanding discs.   

286
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,895
      and at this station,      
     four rolls of sandpaper    

287
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,431
   are simultaneously unwound   
         into a machine.        

288
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,301
    it carves the four layers   
        into rectangles.        

289
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,239
        these rectangles        
   won't be used for sanding,   

290
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,741
        but as grip tape        
        for skateboards.        

291
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,377
 from refinishing your furniture

292
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,647
        to nose-grinding        
       at the skate park,       

293
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,183
            sandpaper           
  will always give you an edge. 

294
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,851
     and with so many grits     
         to choose from,        

295
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,855
   there really is a sandpaper  
         for every job.         

296
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,867
