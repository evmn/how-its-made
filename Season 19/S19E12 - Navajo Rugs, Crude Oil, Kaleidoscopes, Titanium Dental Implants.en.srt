narrator: rug weaving is a traditional art      

4
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,422
practiced by the navajo,    

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,192
an indian nation located in the united states  

6
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:04,797
where colorado, new mexico, utah, and arizona intersect.  

7
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,733
they originally wove blankets and clothing.     

8
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,401
then, in the early 1800s,   

9
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,671
they began weaving rugs for sale.           

10
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,144
while many weavers create contemporary designs,     

11
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,882
navajo rugs typically feature bold geometric patterns.    

12
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,084
the wool-preparation and weaving techniques     

13
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,086
developed by the weavers' ancestors   

14
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,624
have been proudly passed down from generation to generation. 

15
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,894
everything in a navajo rug comes from nature,       

16
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,764
starting with fleece -- raw wool sheared from a sheep. 

17
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,766
working a handful at a time,  

18
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,702
the weaver removes the mats and tangles      

19
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,305
and places the wool on carders --         

20
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,574
wooden paddles with metal teeth.

21
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,443
by pulling one carder against the other,       

22
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,646
she straightens the wool fibers,

23
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,580
lining them up in the same direction.     

24
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,982
this prepares them to be spun 

25
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,319
into one continuous strand of yarn.            

26
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,123
after three or four pulls, she flips the carders     

27
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,660
to straighten the fibers on the underside.       

28
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,194
then she rolls up the fleece  

29
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,264
and adds it to the other rolls in the spinning pile.     

30
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,004
she spins the fleece one roll at a time       

31
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,274
with the traditional spindle that she lays against her thigh

32
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,411
and rotates towards her with one hand.         

33
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,280
this movement twists the carded roll of fleece   

34
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,215
into a strand.         

35
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,349
when she reaches the end of the roll,      

36
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,486
she connects another and resumes spinning      

37
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,087
and keeps repeating this process

38
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,824
until she's produced one long, continuous strand       

39
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,060
from about 50 rolls.      

40
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,237
then she respins the strand  

41
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,739
to thin it out to the final weaving size.   

42
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,980
when she's done,        

43
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,583
she checks           
the entire length of the strand,

44
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,252
pulling on the thicker areas to thin them out        

45
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,921
so that the entire strand is a consistent size      

46
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,525
from one end to the other.   

47
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,131
here you can see the difference in thickness  

48
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,500
between the first spinning and the second.        

49
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:28,073
to infuse her wool with color, she prepares natural dyes --  

50
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:32,144
sunflowers for yellow, walnuts for tan and brown hues,

51
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,346
and cactus bugs for bright red.

52
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,552
she puts the bugs in a stocking

53
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,954
and soaks them in warm water overnight.    

54
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,293
then, she submerges them in a pot of water,       

55
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,495
pours in the presoak water, as well,            

56
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,231
and simmers for 45 minutes to an hour and a half,     

57
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,702
depending on how vibrant she wants the red dye to be.  

58
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,972
meanwhile, she soaks the yarn in warm water         

59
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,907
for at least a half-hour    

60
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,977
to open up the fibers so that they'll absorb the dye.

61
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,780
after wringing out the yarn,  

62
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,182
she immerses it in the pot of hot dye     

63
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,651
and simmers for at least 45 minutes,    

64
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,387
depending on the amount of bugs,
water, and wool.        

65
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,593
she stirs frequently to ensure it dyes evenly throughout.   

66
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,196
it's the same process with plant dyes,        

67
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:27,399
except that she doesn't presoak the plants overnight  

68
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,268
before boiling them in water. 

69
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,404
the shade of color depends on the ratio of plants to water

70
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,340
during dye preparation,    

71
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,875
then of dye to the quantity of wool.    

72
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,545
proportionally more plants than dye,           

73
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,946
the darker the shade.     

74
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,883
proportionately less, the lighter the shade.     

75
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:53,292
sunflowers and walnuts are just two of many plants  

76
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,361
the navajo have traditionally used       

77
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,264
to produce a rainbow of dyes for their textiles.      

78
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,035
with her wool now spun and dyed,

79
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,372
the weaver picks up her weaving comb and begins.  

80
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:10,175
navajo ancestors used trees as the sides of their looms.  

81
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,846
today's weavers make looms from lumber or metal pipes.  

82
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,648
after stringing tight, vertical strands of wool

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,783
called the warp,        

84
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,852
she uses a flat, handmade stick called a batten 

85
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,321
to pry a wide enough opening  

86
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,558
through which to pass her hand with the colored weaving wool. 

87
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,996
she weaves horizontally in and out between the warp  

88
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,798
first in one direction, then in the other.       

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,067
then, she packs down the wool tightly with her comb 

90
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,537
so that the warp doesn't show. 

91
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,807
she mostly eyeballs the emerging unique pattern,  

92
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,676
occasionally counting vertical strands        

93
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,478
to calculate the symmetry,   

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,216
a signature feature of traditional navajo rugs.  

95
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,232
narrator: crude oil, also called petroleum,     

96
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,368
is unprocessed oil found deep in the ground.   

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,570
it forms naturally       

98
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,840
from decomposed, prehistoric plants and animals.

99
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,708
the color can range from clear to black,      

100
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,779
the consistency from very watery
to very thick.         

101
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,252
oil companies drill wells deep into the ground      

102
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,189
then install pumping units to draw up the fluid      

103
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:34,059
that contains crude oil and salty water.        

104
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,862
this oil field in central california     

105
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,730
has 6,000 producing wells.   

106
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,866
the pumping units can run 24 hours a day.        

107
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,135
however, a sensor triggers them to pump 

108
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,538
only when the fluid flow stops.

109
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,808
here's what goes on inside the well.        

110
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,276
with each downstroke,     

111
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,746
the pumping unit pushes a steel rod          

112
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,348
down the steel tube lining the well.        

113
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,884
with each upstroke, the rod rises,         

114
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,285
and the pressure difference  

115
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,155
between the fluid on the outside
and fluid on the inside    

116
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,291
opens a ball-shaped valve plugging the bottom,      

117
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,760
letting the fluid flow up the tube.          

118
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,762
another valve at the top    

119
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,766
releases the fluid out of the well.        

120
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,434
to drill a new well,      

121
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,837
workers first erect a drilling rig at the site   

122
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,641
then hoist a giant pipe with a drill bit on the end.  

123
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,043
they feed this drill pipe   

124
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,311
through the center of a spinning disk       

125
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,047
called a rotary table.     

126
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,316
as the table turns, the drill pipe turns,     

127
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,118
its weight bearing down    

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,054
and boring a hole through the ground.      

129
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,258
once the drill pipe descends its full 30-foot length,    

130
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,926
they connect another pipe   

131
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:44,263
then keep repeating with subsequent drill pipes  

132
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:49,134
until they bore into the reservoir containing fluid.

133
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,069
throughout the drilling process,

134
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,672
they pump a mud mixture down the drill pipe.      

135
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,141
it comes out the drill bit at the end,          

136
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,278
hits the bottom of the hole, then backs up to the top,   

137
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,514
bringing the drilled-out rock with it.            

138
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,683
after lining the well with a steel tube       

139
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,018
to keep the walls from collapsing inward,    

140
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,887
they mount the pumping unit  

141
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,957
and install the valves we saw in the model.

142
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,360
the pumping unit pushes the rod up and down      

143
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,495
through the well head at the surface.        

144
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:21,833
as a safety measure,      

145
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,968
workers take readings to check the air        

146
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,438
for any hazardous underground gases       

147
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,440
that may be exiting the well. 

148
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,843
once they determine the area is safe,       

149
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,510
they draw a sample of fluid  

150
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,913
to test the well's water-to-oil ratio. 

151
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:39,485
the typical ratio is 90% water to 10% oil.     

152
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,255
the fluid from each well exits via a pipe,          

153
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,191
and the pipes from all the wells

154
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,396
feed a main line leading to a gas-removal vessel.    

155
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,265
the fluid contains carbon dioxide,        

156
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,000
hydrogen sulfide, and natural gas.        

157
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,270
they naturally rise to the top of the vessel    

158
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,004
and exit via a pipe      

159
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,942
which runs to the company's gas-treatment plant.      

160
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,546
there, equipment removes    
and treats the hydrogen sulfide,

161
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,882
transforming it into sulfur,  

162
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:13,819
which a local farm buys to use as fertilizer.     

163
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:18,223
the natural gas and co2, meanwhile,           

164
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,958
are piped to another area,   

165
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,161
where they fuel the company's steam generator. 

166
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,031
the generator boils the water extracted from the fluid    

167
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,433
to produce steam.       

168
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,569
the company injects steam into the wells         

169
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,770
to heat the fluid,       

170
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,106
thinning it so that it flows faster.    

171
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,112
once gasless, the fluid is piped

172
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:43,982
to the treatment plant that extracts the salty water. 

173
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,117
in this big tank,       

174
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,186
appropriately called the free-water knockout,    

175
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,522
the separation of oil and water
happens naturally,       

176
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:54,593
the oil floating to the top.  

177
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,995
however, to hasten that natural process,

178
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,598
they add a chemical called an emulsion breaker.  

179
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,470
the extracted water exits   

180
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:07,406
via a pipe leading to the steam generator.    

181
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:10,008
the oil goes to a clarification tank    

182
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,144
in which a chemical process filters out sand,       

183
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,215
which the fluid brought up from the reservoir.      

184
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,218
the emulsion breaker added in the previous tank   

185
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,752
continues to extract water.  

186
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:26,758
by the end, when the ratio is 98% oil to 2% water or better, 

187
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,561
the crude oil is ready to sell.

188
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,563
built-in meters give      

189
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,765
instantaneous water-content readings.    

190
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,703
as an additional quality-control
measure, however,       

191
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:42,106
the company also draws samples for analysis in its onsite lab.

192
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,510
in fact, there's testing throughout production     

193
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,780
to ensure sufficient water is being extracted       

194
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,849
at each phase of processing.  

195
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,319
refineries buy crude oil as a raw material       

196
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,923
for producing gasoline, asphalt,
plastics,           

197
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,725
and many other products.    

198
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,943
narrator: invented in the early 19th century   

199
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,078
by a scottish scientist studying light,        

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,013
the kaleidoscope can still compete       

201
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,350
when it comes to producing stunning visual effects.    

202
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,020
peer inside and witness dazzling geometric images   

203
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,857
produced as mirrors multiply objects.       

204
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,963
the images are spectacular and fleeting,         

205
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,700
each one lasting just seconds before the next appears.    

206
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,369
many years after its invention,

207
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,506
the kaleidoscope is still worth looking into.  

208
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,309
to make a kaleidoscope, this craftsman starts     

209
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,446
with a mirror sheet that has adhesive backing.   

210
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,849
he scores it to create long and narrow rectangles   

211
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,852
and gently breaks it along the scored lines.    

212
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,055
the mirror's reflective coating

213
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,523
is on the front instead of the underside.   

214
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,326
a mirror like this produces sharper reflections      

215
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,128
than a regular household mirror.

216
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,798
he slices the adhesive backing 

217
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,801
to separate the mirrored rectangles.    

218
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:20,472
he snaps off the scored ends, 
creating perfectly linear edges.

219
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,279
next, he peels backing from a strip of black-out felt paper

220
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,814
and wraps it around a glass rectangle.   

221
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,285
this felt-wrapped glass will be
the third wall         

222
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,889
of a two-mirror system -- one 
with a triangular configuration.

223
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,625
he removes the adhesive film from the mirrors        

224
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,094
then builds the triangles   

225
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,495
with the mirrors' reflective surfaces      

226
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,499
facing inward towards the felt-wrapped rectangle.  

227
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,302
this arrangement will reflect objects            

228
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,572
to create a circular image known as a mandala.      

229
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,975
he aims the mirror system at a light box         

230
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,711
with a two-line drawing in it. 

231
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,414
one line is curved, and the other is straight.   

232
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,584
peering into it,        

233
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,586
he adjusts the alignment of the mirrors         

234
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,923
until the lines morph into a five-point star.    

235
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,394
this means the corners of the mirror triangle     

236
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,195
are precisely 36 degrees    

237
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,999
and it is multiplying images correctly.       

238
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,535
he hot-glues the mirrors to the opaque part       

239
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:26,537
and applies metal tape to the top seam        

240
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,808
to complete the kaleidoscope mirror system.

241
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,343
over in the art department,  

242
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,878
the artist assembles decorative objects       

243
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,748
against a black background in an acrylic cell.      

244
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,283
with every placement,     

245
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:42,621
she checks the effect through the triangular mirror system. 

246
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:46,557
she glues dichroic glass onto the backdrop.       

247
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,759
it's a kind of glass      

248
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,161
that's been treated with metal oxides,       

249
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,764
and it appears to have different hues.    

250
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:57,435
other objects include jewelry parts, colored wire,  

251
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,304
buttons, and even paper clips. 

252
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:05,310
she follows no specific design but works freestyle.      

253
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,712
while she glues some down,   

254
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:12,250
she leaves others loose to simply tumble around.    

255
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,854
a sprinkle of tiny beads completes the grouping.     

256
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,390
as the mirror system multiplies
these objects,         

257
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:21,593
they will create the mandalas. 

258
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,396
these are photographs of actual mandalas,      

259
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:28,933
and they'll be used to decorate 
the outside of the kaleidoscope.

260
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,669
the other member of the team  

261
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,738
now applies an acrylic adhesive
to the rim of the cell     

262
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,408
and presses a clear lid onto it.

263
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,678
the lid fuses to the cell body.

264
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,215
but it's not yet completely sealed.            

265
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,151
there's a tiny hole in the side of the cell    

266
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,354
through which he now dispenses heavy mineral oil.       

267
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,555
submerged in mineral oil,   

268
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,692
the objects will float and move through the cell   

269
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,026
for greater effect.      

270
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,201
he plugs the hole with an acrylic adhesive and screw. 

271
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,174
he is now ready        

272
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:12,043
to assemble all the parts of the kaleidoscope.      

273
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,111
he slides the mirror system  

274
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:18,517
into a heavy cardboard tube  
decorated by the mandala photos.

275
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,252
he cushions the mirror system with foam,           

276
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,854
and this stabilizes it.    

277
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:26,858
he installs a metal eyepiece and glass lens         

278
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,294
on one end of the kaleidoscope tube.   

279
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,598
he slides the object cell   

280
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,002
into a protective metal cage that rotates.         

281
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,805
he places a transparent glass disk    

282
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,139
over the cell.         

283
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,344
he applies adhesive to the cage
and inserts the assembly    

284
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,814
into the other end of the kaleidoscope tube.   

285
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,284
this kaleidoscope is now ready for a viewing.         

286
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,488
light passes through the object cell,    

287
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,956
illuminating the trinkets.   

288
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,626
reflections bounce off the mirrors to create   

289
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,163
one spectacular illusion after another.         

290
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,032
two centuries after its invention,      

291
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,700
the view through the kaleidoscope    

292
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,036
still fascinates.       

293
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:29,721
narrator: the ancient mayans hammered seashells into their jaws   

294
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,189
to replace missing teeth.   

295
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:35,193
those seashells were likely the first dental implants.   

296
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,663
today, titanium tooth implants fill the gaps nicely,     

297
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,065
and, usually, the patient's jawbone     

298
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,868
will actually bond to them.  

299
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,273
in the middle of the 20th century,      

300
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,741
it was discovered       

301
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:53,278
that titanium is a metal that bonds with bone.     

302
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,480
it revolutionized restorative dentistry,     

303
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,617
making enduring tooth implants possible.           

304
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,419
to make these implants,    

305
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,755
they start with a solid titanium rod.   

306
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:09,494
this 13-foot rod will be used to make more than 200 implants.

307
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,633
the technician inserts the rod in a long tubular device    

308
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,870
that keeps it straight as it feeds to a lathe system. 

309
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,843
the titanium rod spins     

310
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:27,311
as computerized tools slim it down          

311
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,947
and cut threads into it.    

312
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,851
these threads will help anchor the implants    

313
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,953
in the patient's jaw.     

314
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,657
the lathe pushes the rod out  

315
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,926
and then pulls it back in repeatedly           

316
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,864
to facilitate the shaping process.      

317
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:51,169
a tool now grips the implant  
while another cuts it to length.

318
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,806
then, a computerized drill hollows out the implant    

319
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:59,010
and carves threads inside   
for attaching the ceramic tooth.

320
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,946
in minutes, a solid, metal cylinder becomes     

321
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,948
a hollowed and threaded implant.

322
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,618
a robot now retrieves the implant          

323
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,154
from the clutches of another one.        

324
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,758
it transfers it to a cleaning station     

325
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,829
and then over to what's known as a vision measuring system. 

326
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,899
here, a camera takes pictures of the implant from all angles 

327
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,236
and sends the images to a computer for analysis.  

328
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,638
the computer confirms     

329
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,907
the dimensions are exactly right.         

330
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,576
then, the robot collects the implant 

331
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,178
and places it into a slot in a tray.     

332
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,213
once filled with implants,   

333
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,517
a technician screws a mesh lid on the tray     

334
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,320
and slides it into a metal basket.      

335
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,056
the basket positions them for cleaning          

336
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:50,328
in a special washing machine known as a vapor degreaser.   

337
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,531
inside,            
solvent vapors envelop the parts

338
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,534
to clean off residual lubricant oils    

339
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,870
used during the cutting process.

340
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,939
a robot transfers an implant to a holding device.      

341
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,476
the device secures the implant 

342
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:08,046
for the next robot to press a plastic collar onto it.   

343
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,950
this collar is temporary.   

344
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,419
it will serve as a mask    

345
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,620
to protect the outside of the implant         

346
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:20,125
as the top undergoes a process of colorization.   

347
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:26,030
a robot places the implant upside down in a mild acid.  

348
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,033
they apply an electrical charge.

349
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,303
different colors will appear at different voltages     

350
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,573
to color-code the part and indicate the diameter.   

351
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,844
the process is called anodizing.

352
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,714
a robot now pulls off the masking collar.      

353
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,451
it transfers the implants to another tray        

354
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,919
and screws them onto it.    

355
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,387
this keeps them from falling off

356
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,458
as machinery turns the tray upside down          

357
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,793
to immerse the implants in acid            

358
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,495
and anodize the exterior.   

359
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,067
this time, the anodizing serves
another purpose.        

360
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,404
it changes the surface to make it more porous.    

361
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,073
this will improve the bonding of the patient's jawbone    

362
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,442
to the implant.        

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,280
the implant sparkles in the solution        

364
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,616
as it undergoes a transformation.       

365
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:27,224
here's the new porous surface magnified by a microscope.   

366
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,762
a robot transfers the dental implants      

367
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,363
to another tray.        

368
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:36,700
they're now ready for a final cleaning.     

369
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,370
a technician puts a lid on the tray          

370
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,241
and lowers it into a tank full of hot, purified water.  

371
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,378
a generator sends high-frequency sound waves   

372
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,913
into the water,        

373
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,617
creating bubbles and waves that gently scrub the implants.

374
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:58,656
after sterilization, these titanium dental implants 

375
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:02,660
are ready to take root in human jaws.         

376
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:06,463
the clinician screws the implant
into the patient's jawbone   

377
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,401
and then secures a made-to-match
ceramic tooth to it.      

378
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:14,072
over time, bone will fuse to this artificial tooth,   

379
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,341
providing           
a long-lasting tooth replacement

380
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,878
and giving the patient a reason to smile.       

381
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,224
