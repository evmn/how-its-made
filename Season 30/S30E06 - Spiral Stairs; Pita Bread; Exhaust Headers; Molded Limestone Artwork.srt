    to make one stair tread.

 a fixture while the glue sets.

    removes more of the glue.   

78

and carves a groove in the wood.

79

  this will enable the railing  
         to be installed

81

82

 of dough into many small blobs.

124
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:18,703
 to do this, it forces the dough
      through a round hole,     

125
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:24,043
 and a guillotine blade chops it
    to the correct thickness.   

126
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:27,246
 the dough blobs ride a conveyor
     and pass under a roller    

127
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,982
       that flattens them.      

128
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,986
  flour from an overhead sifter 
      dusts the dough blobs     

129
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:38,189
   to keep them from sticking   
        to the machinery.       

130
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,058
   each one of these flattened  
           dough blobs          

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,927
 will eventually become a pita. 

132
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,999
    the round pieces of dough   
            now ride            

133
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,668
  a conveyor up to a warm zone. 

134

  over a period of 15 minutes,  
       the yeast ferments,      

135
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,074
   causing the dough to rise.   

136
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,943
out of the fermentation station,

137
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:03,215
        a roller flattens       
 the pita dough segments again. 

138
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,617
        they're now ready       
     to be rolled very thin     

139
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,886
 in a process known as sheeting.

140
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,691

  the pita dough much thinner.  

141
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,360
   rolling it in one direction  

142
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,896
    makes the dough segments    
          oval-shaped.          

143
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,301
 the oval pitas ride by a pusher

144
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:28,239
      that now shoves them      
    towards the final roller.   

145
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,910
 it rolls the dough in the other
direction to round out the shape

146
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,579
    and make it even thinner.   

147
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,184
    perfectly round and thin,   

148
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,055
   the pitas now travel up to   
 another fermentation operation.

149
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,926
     inside, the temperature    
           is toasty.           

150
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,329
  it's warm enough to reawaken  
            the yeast           

151
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,598
       and cause the dough      
         to rise again.         

152
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,471
  conveyors move in criss-cross 
  directions to take the pitas  

153
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,206
         back and forth.        

154
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,144
    this zig-zagging journey    
     lasts about 15 minutes.    

155
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,413
      when the pitas emerge     
        from the chamber,       

156
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,150

         substantially.         

157
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,354
     they head into an oven     
    where the magic happens.    

158
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:18,490
    the oven's temperature is   
           between 750          

159
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,959
   and 930 degrees fahrenheit.  

160
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,495
         they spend just        
        15 seconds in it.       

161
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,231
    this flash-baking causes    
     the water in the dough     

162
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,632
        to turn to steam.       

163
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,903
   the steam puffs the pitas,   
    creating pockets inside.    

164

167
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,181

168
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,648
        once sliced open,       

169
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,319
   the pockets can be stuffed   
      to create sandwiches.

      of an automated arm.      

173

174
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,935

  how does one mold limestone?  

279
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,316
   200 years ago, some people   
   in france figured out how,   

280
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:31,222
 and their descendents are still
molding limestone artwork today.

281
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,860
   this unique art form exists  
   because, two centuries ago,  

282
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:39,664
  a family in france discovered 
   springs amid volcanic rock,  

283
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,334
   springs with water so rich   
      in calcium carbonate

00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,470
  that it petrified into stone. 

285
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,139
       that is limestone.       

286
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,409
  the family carved out caves,  
       then invented a way      

287
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,680
to capture the calcium carbonate
  and mold sculptures with it.  

288
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,918
  the descendents of the family 
 continue that tradition today. 

289

    the springwater contains    
 two grams of calcium carbonate

         of iron oxide,         

291
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,826
  which makes the water orange. 

292
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,962

 gutta-percha is a natural latex

302

        made from the sap       
       of the gutta tree.       

303
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,457

 it has to sit on a support tray

 calcium carbonate in the molds.
