narrator: industrial casters are used to move heavy equipment            

4
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,726
from one location to another.  

5
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,528
the wheels make it easy to move mining machinery,    

6
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,263
large medical devices,      

7
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,866
or factory carts         

8
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,368
wherever and whenever it's required.          

9
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,341
the size of the object      

10
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:19,211
determines the size of the casters used to move it.               

11
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,214
heavy items need casters with thicker wheels.       

12
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,749
some larger objects       

13
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,753
may need multiple wheels to evenly distribute its weight.             

14
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,555
first, they make the top plate,             

15
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,625
which mounts the caster underneath the object.      

16
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:35,094
they begin with a thick sheet of steel.            

17
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,030
a computer-guided cutting machine combines oxygen     

18
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:42,101
and electricity to produce plasma.        

19
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:47,173
this incredibly hot flame melts             
the steel to cut out the part.  

20
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:50,910
they make several other caster parts out of steel coil.     

21
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:55,047
it's a thinner, more flexible type of steel.   

22
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,383
they fit it through a punch press.      

23
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,052
the press strikes it with a yoke-shaped die.     

24
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:06,192
the yokes are the arms that hold each side of the wheel axle.   

25
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:15,134
workers place each yoke piece in a forming press.       

26
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,337
the press bends the piece into the required shape.     

27
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,540
it also makes a circular groove             
around the hole in the middle.  

28
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,616
next they fill the groove with steel ball bearings.    

29
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,955
these bearings allow the yoke to swivel.            

30
00:02:35,957 --> 00:02:40,826
the steel retainer holds the ball bearings in place.   

31
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,828
they fill the grooves of the steel cap         

32
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,297
with ball bearings, as well.   

33
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,166
then they place it in a punch press         

34
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,569
and position the yoke on top of it.          

35
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,371
the press joins the cap to the yokes retainer,      

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,642
sandwiching the ball bearings in between.           

37
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,345
after riveting the top plate to the yoke,           

38
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,516
they put a steel seal over the retainer.        

39
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,552
they lock it in place with a pneumatic press.     

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,594
this factory purchases nylon  
wheel inserts from a supplier.  

41
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:21,600
workers place the inserts    
in an injection molding press.  

42
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:27,606
the press melts neoprene rubber and injects it into the mold.  

43
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,941
once it cools to a solid state,             

44
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,212
the machine ejects what are now rubber-edged wheels.       

45
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:40,819
this process takes about four minutes.       

46
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,888
the rubber edge absorbs shock,  

47
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,559
reduces noise, and prevents damage to the floor.       

48
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,165
when this factory needs to make larger wheels,   

49
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,367
they use a different injection molding press,          

50
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,102
one that can make wheels     

51
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,439
five times larger than their standard models.      

52
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,242
it works exactly like the other injection molder             

53
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,145
except it only makes one wheel at time.             

54
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:18,256
a worker carefully places the wheel on a cool-down rack  

55
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,326
for two and a half hours.    

56
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,000
the wheel molds are made of two parts.      

57
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:32,738
the parts form a seam once attached.          

58
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
a worker grinds down the rubber seam       

59
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,842
until the surface is smooth.   

60
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:44,750
now that all the caster's parts             
are ready, assembly can begin.  

61
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:48,286
first they place a two-part bearing inside the wheel     

62
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,056
and lock it into position with a pneumatic press.     

63
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,899
next they install a steel guard on each side.          

64
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,902
the guards prevent anything from getting inside the wheel  

65
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,637
and inhibiting its movement.   

66
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,641
they position the wheel between the yokes and insert   

67
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,042
the steel wheel axle.      

68
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,713
a bolt head secures one end,   

69
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,915
and they attach a nut to the other.          

70
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,252
then they tighten everything with an impact gun.       

71
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,522
they inject grease to lubricate the ball bearings.            

72
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,458
this factory runs random samples through a series         

73
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,994
of quality control tests.    

74
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,729
a machine applies weight     

75
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,999
and counts how many revolutions the caster can withstand     

76
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,835
before it finally breaks.    

77
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,806
this factory also makes special casters      

78
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,876
for oven and freezer carts using rubber wheels       

79
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:49,681
built to withstand extreme heat or cold.             

80
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,218
their ball bearings are also lubricated with grease             

81
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,820
that doesn't freeze or melt.   

82
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,457
casters can also come equipped with a foot-activated brake.   

83
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,171
narrator: wedding cakes have become    

84
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,774
bigger and more elaborate over the years.         

85
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,976
today's wedding cakes      

86
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:19,511
are multi-tiered and even multi-flavored.     

87
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,846
they're typically covered in fondant icing         

88
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,450
and decorated with ornate sugar flowers.    

89
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,852
the finished product is an edible work of art,    

90
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,921
perfect for that special day.  

91
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:36,195
these customized wedding cakes are covered in fondant.     

92
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,263
this special icing acts as a canvas           

93
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,166
on which delicious designs can be created.         

94
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,938
the baker starts by making chocolate cakes         

95
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,673
for the bottom tier.       

96
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,874
once the cakes come out of the oven,      

97
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,078
she transfers them directly to the fridge.          

98
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,349
the cool, firm cakes      
are easy to slice into layers.  

99
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:01,487
she spreads buttercream frosting between the layers.       

100
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:05,090
the frosting ingredients    
include lightly salted butter,  

101
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,358
icing sugar,           

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,827
and dutch cocoa powder.     

103
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,095
layer by layer,         

104
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,566
she builds the tier to the desired height.      

105
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,369
she puts the tier back in the fridge.       

106
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,772
while it's solidifying, she makes the gum paste     

107
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:24,109
that will be used to craft the edible flowers.   

108
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,346
first, she adds icing sugar to egg whites...         

109
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,286
...then thins out the mixture with a teaspoon of water.    

110
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,657
next, she adds food coloring.  

111
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,063
she mixes the ingredients for a couple of minutes     

112
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:47,032
until they're thoroughly blended.             

113
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,801
she adds tylose powder,     

114
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:53,338
a synthetic version of gum arabic to harden the mixture.  

115
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,675
after another 15 seconds of mixing, the gum paste     

116
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,877
is ready for kneading.      

117
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,814
the baker rubs some vegetable shortening on her hands     

118
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,615
for lubrication.         

119
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,550
she sprinkles some icing sugar  

120
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,887
on the table to prevent the gum paste from sticking.   

121
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,158
then she kneads the gum paste for 5 to 10 minutes.       

122
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,028
now the artistry begins.     

123
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,098
she uses a set of modeling tools made of food-safe,        

124
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,900
nonstick plastic.        

125
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,303
first she makes a little hat out of the pink gum paste.    

126
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,974
then she rolls out another piece until it's paper thin.      

127
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,709
the baker uses a gum paste    

128
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,245
cutter to cut out several teardrop shapes.     

129
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,850
one at a time, she lays the tear drops out on a hard foam mat.  

130
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,521
she thins and curls the edges with a ball-tipped modeling tool              

131
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,458
to create a natural-looking rose petal.           

132
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,194
then she switches to a scribe tool.              

133
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,232
she curls back the edges to make the petal even more lifelike.  

134
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,437
then she applies tasteless edible glue.           

135
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:05,210
she adheres the first petal onto the point of the gum paste hat.              

136
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,544
she wraps it all the way     

137
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,281
around to create the center of the rose.           

138
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,483
the baker attaches the next layer,              

139
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,752
this time using two petals.   

140
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,821
she adds several additional layers        

141
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:20,425
using two more petals each time until the rose is complete.   

142
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,761
she snips off the base of the hat,           

143
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,697
then lets the glue dry for 15 minutes.       

144
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:31,770
the baker uses green gum paste to make the leaves.       

145
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:36,040
she rolls the paste thicker at the base and thinner at the top.              

146
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,911
then she presses the sheet against the top of the board   

147
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:43,248
to produce vertical veins.    

148
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,317
she centers her leaf-shaped cutter over one of the veins   

149
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,521
and cuts out a leaf.       

150
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:53,325
after attaching the wire to the base,           

151
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,327
she uses a silicone stamp    

152
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,729
to imprint smaller veins on the leaf.           

153
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,232
this makes it look more realistic.       

154
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:09,274
the baker curls the leaf's edges with a round tool.        

155
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,277
she uses a different tool to deepen some of the veining  

156
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,613
and complete the leaf.      

157
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,349
the baker sets her decorations aside              

158
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:21,420
and removes the cake tiers from the refrigerator.      

159
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,422
she firmly applies the fondant  

160
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:28,026
over the chilled chocolate frosting.       

161
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,163
she made the fondant earlier with melted marshmallows,    

162
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,798
butter, icing sugar, vanilla extract,         

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,367
and food coloring.        

164
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,903
she applies fondant to the remaining tiers,     

165
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,404
then stacks them.        

166
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:46,578
she begins decorating this cake with ribbon and italian lace.  

167
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,847
she attaches the flowers with stiff edible glue      

168
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:54,186
made from egg whites, icing sugar, and lemon juice.  

169
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,988
she can also make edible ribbons             

170
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,389
and lace by pouring liquid gum paste   

171
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,392
into the appropriate molds.   

172
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:04,196
this special gum paste uses corn syrup and corn starch             

173
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,665
to reach the right consistency.          

174
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,800
a magnificent custom-made cake  

175
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,204
is designed to be a showpiece at the wedding reception,    

176
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:16,542
admired, devoured, and always remembered.      

177
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,423
narrator: terahertz spectrometers use i 

178
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,893
to see through objects, including living tissue.     

179
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,295
these t-rays are an emerging technology    

180
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,566
that allows objects to be imaged and analyzed.    

181
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,769
it's a form of radiation that is non-ionizing       

182
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,071
and believed to be non-destructive.      

183
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,311
an alternative to x-rays and ultrasound,    

184
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,979
terahertz technology       

185
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,981
generates a light that can't be seen by the naked eye,      

186
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,385
but it can see         
what lies beneath the surface.  

187
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,787
the technology has potential applications      

188
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,322
in the medical, security,    

189
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,591
and manufacturing fields.    

190
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,127
production starts with the circuit board holder  

191
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,598
for the transmitter sensor head.              

192
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,533
computerized tools drill a hole              

193
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,736
into a cylindrical piece of brass             

194
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,472
and carve ridged slots to hold the circuit board.    

195
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,612
another tool transforms a second brass cylinder     

196
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:29,181
into the main body for the sensor head.       

197
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,488
this is the completed sensor head body.        

198
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,093
a technician screws an optical collimator into the housing.   

199
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,363
this device separates the laser light into parallel beams.    

200
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,767
he inserts a lens in the housing.         

201
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,236
the next piece he installs adjusts the position            

202
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,739
of the circuit board holder in the spectrometer.       

203
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,510
he selects a circuit board.   

204
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,844
it has a sensor chip       

205
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,981
in the center that emits terahertz light.   

206
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,517
he places it into the holder   

207
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,653
and slides the holder on the sensor body.       

208
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:15,660
he uses steel pins to lock it in place.       

209
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,897
the worker fastens a larger lens on the end.           

210
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,403
a device holds the sensor head in place             

211
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,405
as he tweaks the position of the circuit board.      

212
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,376
it must be perfectly aligned in order to receive the laser beam.              

213
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,216
he attaches a round circuit board to the sensor head.    

214
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,818
this board will allow the sensor             

215
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,555
head to establish electrical connections.     

216
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,491
next he installs the collimating module.             

217
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,627
this device has a larger lens than the sensor head       

218
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,366
so it can send parallel terahertz beams further.     

219
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:58,236
he attaches a retainer ring to the module.          

220
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,705
the technician screws the collimating module      

221
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,240
to the sensor head.       

222
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,876
now the spectrometer transmitter is complete.           

223
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,817
he slides the base of the stand into a rail system.       

224
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,191
he installs a receiver at the other end of the rail,  

225
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,993
and connects fiber optic cables to both the transmitter     

226
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,930
and the receiver.        

227
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,998
the next technician       

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,603
assembles the optical chassis that scans objects for imaging.            

229
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,272
he installs lenses in specific locations      

230
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,208
within the aluminum chassis.   

231
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:43,081
he attaches a mirror to a rail in front of the lenses.     

232
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,952
the moving mirror will bounce laser light to scan images.   

233
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,826
he tests the rail system to make sure it shuttles the mirror   

234
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,329
across the spectrometer chassis.            

235
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,436
the technician places the chassis on a steel panel   

236
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,772
and wires the fiber optics throughout.   

237
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,641
he connects the fiber optic cable           

238
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,511
to the laser-generating unit.  

239
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:15,914
he screws an acrylic glass cover to the chassis.         

240
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,516
then he secures the chassis and laser unit          

241
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,051
to the cabinet panel.      

242
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,023
technicians mount the panel to the back           

243
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,194
of the spectrometer cabinet using brackets and screws.    

244
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,336
once it's solidly in place,   
they install the cabinet door.  

245
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:42,474
the door allows for easy access during servicing.        

246
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,877
they lock the door, then screw on the top lid.    

247
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,616
the spectrometer         

248
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,820
is ready for the transmitter and receiver assembly.      

249
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:57,222
the technician pushes the fiber optic cable           

250
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:01,759
through a hole in the lid    
and makes all the connections.  

251
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,629
he tests the device using a plastic bottle.     

252
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,434
the transmitter sends terahertz light through the bottle     

253
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,569
to measure its thickness     

254
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,106
and analyze its chemical composition.    

255
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,944
the receiver collects the data for computer analysis.      

256
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,584
this terahertz spectrometer is now ready to scan objects   

257
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,752
and show them in a new light.  

258
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,203
narrator: thousands of years ago,     

259
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,072
the polynesians built the first catamarans.   

260
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:52,544
then in 1876, an american redesigned one for racing.    

261
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:56,014
it was so fast that it was deemed unfair competition  

262
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,949
and banned from organized racing.      

263
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,618
but eventually, racing catamarans made a comeback    

264
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,621
in the late 20th century.    

265
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,226
with two hulls instead of one,  

266
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:12,831
catamarans skim the water faster than traditional sailboats.   

267
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,633
while a single-hull boat relies on a heavy keel,     

268
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,502
a catamaran uses its width    

269
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,739
as leverage to harness the power of the wind.      

270
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,909
a racing catamaran        

271
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,313
starts with foam material for the hull's lightweight core.              

272
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,916
a worker clamps the foam to a fiberglass form.      

273
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:35,453
then he places it into an oven and closes the door.       

274
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,789
the oven gradually brings the core temperature       

275
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,859
up to 160 degrees fahrenheit.  

276
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,928
after a few minutes, he     
takes the foam out of the oven  

277
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,998
and places an upper form over it.             

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,203
the softened and malleable foam bends to the form's contours.  

279
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,604
after applying a gel coat    

280
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,408
and fiberglass fabric in a hull mold,         

281
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,477
he lays in the shaped foam pieces.           

282
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,048
he fills any gaps in the core  
with slivers of foam material.  

283
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,552
he adds little squares of porous plastic        

284
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:14,092
to reinforce areas where hardware will be attached later.             

285
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:19,831
the worker drapes fiberglass fabric loosely over the core.  

286
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,033
he sprays a small amount of rubber cement         

287
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:26,237
onto the core and presses the fabric into it.       

288
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,107
the cement helps the fabric stick to the core.        

289
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,845
then he stretches nylon fabric over the fiberglass and foam.  

290
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,983
he runs spiral cut tubing along the sides of the mold.   

291
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,620
he cuts it to the right length and tapes it down.        

292
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,724
after laying down a plastic mesh,         

293
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,261
two workers cover the mold and its contents in plastic.   

294
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,734
they secure the edges of the mold with tacky tape,   

295
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,636
creating a tight seal.      

296
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,809
the team connects a vacuum    

297
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,679
to the spiral tubing on one side of the mold.     

298
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,946
when they turn it on,      

299
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,483
the vacuum sucks out the air,  

300
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,885
pulling the layers tightly together.        

301
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,292
they prepare a vinyl-based resin              

302
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,628
and apply it using the vacuum tube.      

303
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,031
the vacuum pumps         

304
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:31,035
the resin through the layers of fiberglass and foam.     

305
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:35,040
the resin takes a couple of hours to dry.         

306
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,241
the team removes the plastic, mesh,              

307
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:41,079
and nylon layers, revealing one half of a catamaran hull.  

308
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,851
next they install the bulkheads.           

309
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,320
they use special tools to accurately position them   

310
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,056
in the hull.           

311
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:57,328
they also place bulkheads in the second half of the hull.              

312
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,664
the workers join the two hulls while they're still in the molds              

313
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,002
and seal the seam with epoxy.  

314
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,937
they remove the hull from the molds          

315
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,939
and cut an opening for the trunk.          

316
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,941
it holds a retractable center board           

317
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,943
for curbing sideways movement.  

318
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:18,883
they attach the screws used to lace the trampoline platform.            

319
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,952
a worker applies glue-back strips     

320
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:26,023
of plastic to protect the fiberglass from chafing.   

321
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,827
he screws sailing hardware to both hulls.          

322
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,764
the hulls are placed in an alignment jig.       

323
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,402
then the team installs crossbars           
that fit into molded recesses.  

324
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,640
they attach a rudder system to each hull           

325
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:45,677
and test them to verify they operate correctly.     

326
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:56,988
the trampoline platform is made of polypropylene.    

327
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,824
the front slides into a molded groove.      

328
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,462
they lace up the back and sides              

329
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,398
with double-braided synthetic rope.         

330
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,136
he pulls the laces tight to keep the platform rigid.   

331
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,743
once the other sailing control lines are in place,   

332
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:25,016
they're ready to hoist the sail on this racing catamaran.    

333
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,818
from start to finish,      

334
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,221
it takes three weeks      
to produce a racing catamaran.  

335
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,628
in competition, these boats have been clocked  

336
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,697
at three times the speed of wind.
