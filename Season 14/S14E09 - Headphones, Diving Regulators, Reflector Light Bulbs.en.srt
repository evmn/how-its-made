1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,120
   narrator: in the early part  
      of the 20th century,      

2
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,588
   headphones were used mainly  

3
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,859
     by telephone operators     
     and radio technicians.     

4
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,193
        but in the 1930s,       

5
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,596
      they were redesigned      
   and marketed to the public,  

6
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,133
   so music lovers everywhere   
           plugged in           

7
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:10,136
  and turned on to the concept. 

8
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,807
   everyone is a music critic,  

9
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,744
   but headphones allow people  
     to crank up the volume     

10
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,281
    without negative feedback   
         from neighbors.        

11
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,149
  to make high-end headphones,  

12
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,120
  an injection-molding machine  
first makes plastic back covers.

13
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,758
    the mesh area will allow    
   sound waves to pass through  

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,361
   instead of reflecting back   
       into the headphone.      

15
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,166
         down the line,         

16
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,836
   equipment stamps trademark   
      and other information     

17
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,171
          onto two more         
      casing components --      

18
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,342
    a decorative metal disk,    
     and a plastic housing.     

19
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,648
        the next machine        
        winds copper wire       

20
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,583
  that's as thin as human hair  

21
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,918
       around a cylinder        
       hundreds of times.       

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,454
           the winding          
     is computer controlled     

23
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,657
           to produce           
     a critical component --    

24
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,526
   the headphone's voice coil.  

25
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,729
         when magnetized        
     by an incoming signal,     

26
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,998
         the voice coil         
      vibrates a diaphragm,     

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,334
    causing it to emit sound.   

28
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,803
 that diaphragm now takes shape 

29
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:22,207
   as a press applies heat and  
 pressure to a plastic membrane.

30
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,211
  these tools mold the plastic  
      to the desired shape.     

31
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:28,013
   the press molds the plastic  
      thicker in the center     

32
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,881
           and thinner          
      around the outer zone     

33
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,819
       for a wide and flat      
     audio-frequency range.     

34
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,089
    a technician punches out    
        the molded shape.       

35
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,629
   she applies a bead of glue   
        to the diaphragm,       

36
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:48,233
 then positions the copper voice
   coil in an assembly device.  

37
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,038
  she aligns the glued section  
 of the diaphragm with the coil.

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,774
       ultraviolet light        
       activates the glue       

39
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:57,109
        to seal the coil        
        to the diaphragm.       

40
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,782
      the plastic housings      
     each contain a magnet.     

41
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:07,787
       the next technician      
     installs the diaphragm     

42
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:11,123
     and voice-coil assembly    
        on that housing.        

43
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,791
        this takes skill        

44
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,127
    because the coil must be    
      positioned precisely      

45
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,196
   for the best sound quality.  

46
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,734
   and this headphone speaker   
is now ready for an audio check.

47
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,471
       a technician tests       
   the audio-frequency range,   

48
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,808
 distortion, and other factors. 

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,812
    here, a technician joins    
    the ends of curved wires    

50
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,013
       in a plastic clip.       

51
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,616
           these wires          
     serve a dual function.     

52
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,218
    they hold the headphones    
      snugly over the ears      

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,686
    and deliver audio signals   

54
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,190
       from the left side       
  of the headphones the right.  

55
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,362
      the next technician       
      installs a connector      

56
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,699
 for the headphone's audio cable
  and a plastic strain relief.  

57
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,972
       an adjustable band       
    will allow the headphones   

58
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,441
         to fit on heads        
    of all shapes and sizes.    

59
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:06,512
 the operator presses the parts 
 together with a hydraulic tool.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,119
      moving down the line,     

61
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,923
 a technician now joins the two 
 halves of the speaker housing. 

62
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,992
           she forces           
     the two parts together     

63
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,862
    with a pneumatic tool...    

64
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:26,332
       and finishes it off      
  with a decorative metal ring. 

65
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,407
           she inserts          
      the speaker mechanism     

66
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,142
  in the center of the housing, 

67
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,813
  then places plastic brackets  
     over it for protection.    

68
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:46,285
   she then secures the entire  
    assembly to the housing.    

69
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,362
   next, she solders two wires  
   to each headphone speaker.   

70
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:59,497
    a plastic ring and cover    
           protect it           

71
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,902
 while still allowing the wires 
          to protrude.          

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,575
     she attaches the end of    
 the headband to the speakers...

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,414
    ...then solders the wires   
        from the speaker        

74
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,316
       to those protruding      
       from the headband.       

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,186
  she presses a plastic grille  
           into place           

76
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,188
        over each speaker       
         very carefully,        

77
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,458
     to prevent scratching.     

78
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,262
 these headphones are now wired 
      and ready for audio.      

79
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,198
      and whether it's rock     
          or classical,         

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,266
       the choice of music      
         will be silent         

81
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,136
   to all but one individual.   

82
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,424
            narrator:           
    the diving regulator is a   
lifeline when you're underwater.

83
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,426
        invented in 1937,       

84
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,430
      this device converts      
compressed air from diving tanks

85
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,165
     into a breathable form     

86
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,834
  and delivers it to the diver  
        via a mouthpiece.       

87
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,103
         and that means,        
  once you've taken the plunge, 

88
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,339
      you can breathe easy.     

89
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:21,846
 the two main parts of a diving 
  regulator are called stages.  

90
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,850
       computerized tools       
   transform a piece of brass   

91
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,653
  into the first-stage housing. 

92
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,788
  they carve a cavity and holes 

93
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,725
       for attaching hoses      
      and other components.     

94
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,596
 a blade cuts the part to size. 

95
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,597
  then, a drill creates a space 

96
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,133
             for the            
    pressure-reduction valve.   

97
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,271
    this end also gets holes    
      for more attachments.     

98
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,975
another tool sculpts the side to
 reduce the weight of the part. 

99
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,813
         sliced in two,         

100
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,950
   this is how the first-stage  
      housing looks inside.     

101
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,021
 after it's been chrome-plated, 

102
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:05,023
 they insert plugs for the holes
     that will later be used    

103
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,193
  for attaching gauges, hoses,  
        and other parts.        

104
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,567
    the fitting that connects   
 the regulator to the scuba tank

105
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,369
   goes into a holding device,  

106
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,038
      while the technician      
    assembles a special valve   

107
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,175
   for keeping salt water out.  

108
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,778
        he fits a piston        
    onto the end of a spring,   

109
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,314
   and then slips the assembly  
         through a hole         

110
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:31,116
 to confirm it's the right size.

111
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,354
      he installs a filter      
 on the other end of the spring.

112
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:42,327
    now he inserts the valve    
         in the fitting.        

113
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,197
          he secures it         
     with this rubber ring,     

114
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,033
    pressing it into a groove   
         in the fitting.        

115
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,006
        the valve appears       
    to be firmly entrenched.    

116
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:58,877
    he presses it to confirm    
     it operates correctly.     

117
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,080
       and he pumps water       
 into a bunch of these fittings 

118
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,484
  to confirm the valves inside  
    are, indeed, watertight.    

119
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,421
   he attaches a rubber cover   
    and a chrome-plated yoke    

120
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,023
         to the fitting,        

121
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,892
   then installs this assembly  
         in the housing,        

122
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:17,629
   using a long-handled socket  
 wrench to get the right torque.

123
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,702
   this yoke swivels to give    
   the diver some flexibility   

124
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,705
         in attaching it        
       to the diving tank.      

125
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,307
        he now assembles        
     a crucial component --     

126
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,577
        the high-pressure       
        reduction valve.        

127
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,712
        installed inside        
    the first-stage housing,    

128
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:37,715
    it converts high pressure   
       to medium pressure.      

129
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,785
  he caps the yoke with a knob, 

130
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,654
          then inserts          
  a pressure-sensing mechanism  

131
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,524
           at one end           
   of the first-stage housing.  

132
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,193
          he covers it          
     with a rubber membrane.    

133
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,328
      as the diver inhales,     

134
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,466
   this membrane will trigger   
 the valve to release more air. 

135
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:58,470
     the diving regulator's     
  first stage is now complete.  

136
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:03,008
 he just needs to calibrate the 
pressure-reduction valve inside.

137
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,277
he hooks it up to compressed air
      and adjusts the valve     

138
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,882
   so it reduces air pressure   
       to a precise level.      

139
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,893
     he immerses it in water    
     to test for air leaks.     

140
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,630
     there are a few bubbles    
  from plunging it underwater,  

141
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:28,633
 but nothing that would indicate
           a problem.           

142
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,704
 they now move on to the diving 
    regulator's second stage,   

143
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,173
       which will convert       
     the medium-pressure air    

144
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,509
      from the first stage      
     to a breathable level.     

145
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,578
      the diver's breathing     
   will trigger this diaphragm  

146
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,913
     to open the air valve.     

147
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,517
 he attached a protective cover,

148
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,121
    and he's ready to install   
     the second-stage valve.    

149
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,528
       after he inserts it      
  in the second-stage housing,  

150
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,064
      the technician makes      
     an initial adjustment.     

151
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,269
 then, using a special tool, he 
 precisely calibrates the valve.

152
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,114
he removed the diaphragm for the
last steps, so he reinstalls it.

153
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,686
    then, it's over to a guy    
    with an ear for the job.    

154
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,355
      as air is pumped into     
        the second stage,       

155
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,893
      he listens for hisses     
   that would indicate a leak.  

156
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,494
    satisfied there are none,   

157
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,430
     he hooks the regulator     
         up to a device         

158
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,098
    that simulates breathing    

159
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,634
     and measures the effort    
       required to inhale.      

160
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,171
   if it checks out, they link  
   the two stages with a hose,  

161
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,875
and this diving regulator is now
equipped to handle the pressure.

162
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,526
narrator: good lighting is often
     a matter of reflection,    

163
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,927
    and that's why, early on,   

164
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,397
        lamps often came        
        with reflectors.        

165
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,467
 but, in 1935, a company figured
   out how to make light bulbs  

166
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,203
    with built-in reflectors.   

167
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,672
     sealing the reflectors     
         inside the bulb        

168
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,074
         kept them clean        
      and maintenance-free.     

169
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,214
         as track lights        
    or in recessed fixtures,    

170
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:27,819
  reflector bulbs can light up  
a room at the flick of a switch.

171
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,822
   the creation of these bulbs  
   begins with the bulb shell,  

172
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,558
  known as the glass envelope.  

173
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,564
 it's comprised of numerous raw 
 ingredients and recycled glass.

174
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:41,967
      production is almost      
      entirely automated.       

175
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:46,171
 an operator activates equipment
   that weighs the ingredients  

176
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,707
        and releases them       
       into a huge hopper,      

177
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,709
 where they're mixed thoroughly.

178
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,580
         this concoction        
    then flows into a furnace   

179
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,817
     heated to 2,700 degrees    
           fahrenheit.          

180
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,791
     it takes up to 24 hours    

181
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:09,861
       for the mix to melt      
     into a taffylike glass.    

182
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,732
    it flows between rollers    
  that shape it into a ribbon.  

183
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,602
  one roller has little pockets 
         on the surface,        

184
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:18,904
      which form the ribbon     
         into segments.         

185
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,941
         these devices,         
       called blow heads,       

186
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,543
   inflate the glass segments   

187
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,612
          through holes         
     in the conveyor chain.     

188
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,854
  this stretches the glass into 
  oblong bubbles called blanks. 

189
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:47,532
   iron molds encase the warm   
   and pliable glass blanks.    

190
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:56,275
   the molds spin as the glass  
 hardens into the desired shape.

191
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,515
 the glass blanks now look like 
  upside-down martini glasses.  

192
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,985
  this is the reflector bulb's  
         glass envelope.        

193
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,322
    it takes just seconds for   
 a glass blank to be transformed

194
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,624
   inside one of these molds.   

195
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,931
 the envelopes are still linked 
by a ribbon of glass at the top,

196
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,468
     so an automated hammer     
  now gently knocks them free.  

197
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,073
       the glass envelopes      
        cool down slowly.       

198
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:30,075
  this stage, called annealing, 

199
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:33,312
       toughens the glass       
     to reduce brittleness.     

200
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,751
   they measure the thickness   
          and diameter          

201
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,152
    of one of the envelopes.    

202
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,820
  if it's not up to standards,  

203
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,158
    the entire production run   
        will be crushed,        

204
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,493
     and the glass recycled     
         into new ones.         

205
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:53,298
    but the envelope is good,   
  and so production continues.  

206
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,700
    they lower the envelopes    
          over nozzles          

207
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,369
 that inject hydrofluoric acid. 

208
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,972
 it coats the inner surface of  
 the glass with a frosty finish 

209
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,508
   that will smooth the light   
       emitted by the bulb      

210
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,444
       and widen the beam.      

211
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,251
          the envelopes         
     now head down a chute,     

212
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,854
      into a padded channel     
    that cushions their fall.   

213
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,928
  guides gently position them.  

214
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,730
       then, other devices      
    thrust them into holders    

215
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,599
 which move them down the line. 

216
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,406
      next, a robot inserts     
 aluminum wire in a heating coil

217
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:37,776
     and places a protective    
      metal dome over top.      

218
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,817
          suction cups          
   pick up the glass envelopes  

219
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,220
       and slide them onto      
  the wire-and-dome assemblies. 

220
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,022
a pump pulls air out of the bulb

221
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,959
    as an electrical current    
   energizes the heating coil   

222
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,428
   to melt the aluminum wire.   

223
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,899
   the aluminum adheres to the  
walls of the light bulb's shell,

224
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,968
 giving it a reflective finish. 

225
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,505
the glass envelopes then move on

226
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:10,175
 to be stamped with the company 
trademark and other information.

227
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,781
           meanwhile,           
   on another production line,  

228
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,717
        they're preparing       
        the glass mounts        

229
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,585
        for the filament        
       and wire contacts.       

230
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,523
         a cutting wheel        
      slices them to size.      

231
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,727
   the tubes then travel past   
            a flame,            

232
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:32,864
 which melts the ends just a bit
    to make the edges smooth.   

233
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,131
      once they've cooled,      

234
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,935
   grippers deliver the tubes   
    to a more intense flame,    

235
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,537
  which flares them at one end. 

236
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,340
 coming up next, we'll show you 
       the inner workings       

237
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,143
  of the reflector light bulb.  

238
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,030
narrator: a reflector light bulb
   can cast one's surroundings  

239
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,565
     in a whole new light --    

240
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,167
     one that's more intense    
          and focused.          

241
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,704
   the source of this light is  
an electrified filament of wire.

242
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,575
and assembling that filament in 
the bulb is a very delicate task

243
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:19,411
        that's performed        
      entirely by machines.     

244
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,450
     production now focuses     
        on the glass tube       

245
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,920
  that will serve as the mount  
        for the filament        

246
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,189
  and its electrical contacts.  

247
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,793
        machinery inserts       
two copper wires into each tube.

248
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,128
    these are the lead wires    

249
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,998
that will eventually connect the
base of the bulb to the filament

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,967
           and deliver          
      the electric current.     

251
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,139
     these long glass tubes     
          will be used          

252
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,741
           to suck air          
     out of the light bulb,     

253
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:55,413
 preventing oxygen from reaching
 the filament and destroying it.

254
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,415
          they protrude         
      from the glass mount,     

255
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,016
   but that's just temporary.   

256
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,319
 they will later be cut shorter.

257
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,224
        torches now melt        
        the glass mount,        

258
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,960
           lead wires,          
   and exhaust tube together.   

259
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,767
  mechanized fingers then pinch 
      the layers together,      

260
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,436
          and the wires         
    are now encased in glass    

261
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,039
          but protrude          
      from the glass base.      

262
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:29,114
        grippers transfer       
the closed mounts to a carousel.

263
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:32,249
 it revolves to allow the mounts
        to receive a coil       

264
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,586
     made of tungsten metal.    

265
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,522
    this coil is the filament   
  of the reflector light bulb.  

266
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,329
       mechanized fingers       
      attach the small coil     

267
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,797
 to hooks on the two lead wires.

268
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,201
 the coiled filament is wobbly, 

269
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,738
  so next it gets some support. 

270
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,674
     first, machinery bends     
         the lead wires         

271
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,210
  to move them and the filament 
         out of the way.        

272
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,413
  then, a robot presses the tip 
    of the glass exhaust tube   

273
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,682
         onto a burner.         

274
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:05,016
         the tip melts,         

275
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,920
  allowing a metal support wire 
     to be embedded into it.    

276
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,895
          another robot         
      bends the lead wires      

277
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:20,398
    to position the filament    
  adjacent to the support wire. 

278
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,638
 the next station loops the wire
      around the filament.      

279
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,240
     this gives the filament    
     the necessary support,     

280
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,575
     and it stops wobbling.     

281
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:38,016
   this 2-pronged device then   
 straightens out the lead wires.

282
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,392
    the mount is now upright    
  and riding another carousel.  

283
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,329
    flippers set it straight    
so a metal disk can be installed

284
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,699
     on the pinched section     
          of the mount.         

285
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,604
    this disk is reflective.    

286
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,138
  it will bounce light downward 

287
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,541
      to the shiny coating      
     inside the light bulb,     

288
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:07,012
to create just the right effect.

289
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,881
with the disk wrapped around it,

290
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:14,485
 the assembly is now positioned 
     on the next turntable.     

291
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,289
 suction cups deposit the glass 
    envelope on the assembly,   

292
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,793
     to encase the filament     
   and reflective disk inside.  

293
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:33,038
the holder twirls the bulb as it
 travels past a row of torches. 

294
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,373
    the flames melt the neck    
     of the glass envelope,     

295
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,444
          and it closes         
     around the glass mount.    

296
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:45,249
   this secures the filament,   
  contacts, and reflective disk 

297
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,285
        inside the bulb.        

298
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,190
 another set of torches, heated 
 to a much higher temperature,  

299
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,393
   trims the base of the bulb.  

300
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,199
   molding devices now move in  
 to shape the bottom of the bulb

301
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,802
         so a metal base        
      can be fitted to it.      

302
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,473
       a gripper then puts      
   that metal base on a track   

303
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,143
         to meet up with        
    the reflector light bulb.   

304
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:15,547
        by now, the bulb        
   has been flushed of oxygen   

305
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,216
    and filled with argon gas   
     so it will last longer.    

306
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,286
 the metal base finishes it off 

307
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,090
   and will allow the bulb to   
be screwed into a light fixture.

308
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:27,225
          another flame         
      heats the metal base      

309
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,627
        to cure adhesive        
       that was preapplied      

310
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,963
 for a strong bond to the bulb. 

311
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,035
      then, robots cut off      
         protruding wire        

312
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,638
 and form a contact on the base.

313
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,377
  it has taken just 12 minutes  

314
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,114
           to assemble          
   this reflector light bulb,   

315
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:52,983
       but it will provide      
   about 2,000 hours of light.
