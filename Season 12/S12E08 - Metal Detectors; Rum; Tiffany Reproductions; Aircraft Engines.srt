       narrator: today on       
       "how it's made"...       

4
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:31,297
       metal detectors...       

5
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:36,769
             rum...             

6
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:42,241
    tiffany reproductions...    

7
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:51,183
      and aircraft engines.     

8
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,119
          airports use          
    handheld metal detectors    

9
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,520
      to safeguard flights.     

10
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,123
      treasure hunters use      
      hobby metal detectors     

11
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,392
      to find buried loot.      

12
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:01,060
   vastly different purposes.   

13
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,930
 yet the technology behind them 
         is identical --        

14
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,065
       a principle called       
       magnetic induction.      

15
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,334
          it all hinges         
   on tiny electrical currents  

16
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,636
    creating magnetic fields.   

17
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:15,273
    a tiny electrical current   

18
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,743
    runs through a wire coil    
      inside the detector,      

19
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,145
   creating a magnetic field.   

20
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,949
  when the detector passes over 
         a metal object,        

21
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,685
     the field is disturbed,    

22
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,420
            producing           
    a small voltage variation   

23
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:28,821
    that triggers the alarm.    

24
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,626
        to make the coil,       
      they use copper wire      

25
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,696
          that's coated         
     with nylon insulation.     

26
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,699
they wind it around the two ends
       of a plastic bobbin      

27
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,235
   a specific number of times.  

28
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,572
         polyester tape         
    keeps it from unraveling.   

29
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,508
    security metal detectors    
         need pure iron         

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,910
      glued into the bobbin     

31
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:55,114
 to increase the magnetic-field 
   strength the coil produces.  

32
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,517
 without it, the coil would have
   to be several times larger   

33
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,454
     and wouldn't fit inside    
        a handheld wand.        

34
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:06,391
 the next step is to solder the 
 coil leads to a circuit board, 

35
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:10,128
 then solder a vibrator motor to
 enable the detector to vibrate 

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,598
         as well as beep        
      when it finds metal.      

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,534
       the board contains       
       a microprocessor,        

38
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,670
      the detector's alarm,     
      and other components      

39
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:21,273
    that react to the signals   
      coming from the coil.     

40
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,808
   the coil and circuit board   

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,077
     now go into the wand's     
        plastic housing.        

42
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,981
     a retaining clip holds     
  the vibrator motor in place.  

43
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:36,154
    they temporarily hook up    
power to the battery compartment

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,557
        and push a button       
      on the circuit board.     

45
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,527
    this calibrates the board   
          to the coil.          

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,533
   they install a sliding cap   
on the detector's on-off switch.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,706
    now they can close her up   

48
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,509
          and stick on          
    the manufacturer's label.   

49
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:03,115
   the last step is to install  
       the 9-volt battery.      

50
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,584
       no metal detector        
       leaves the factory       

51
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,854
   before undergoing extensive  
    quality-control testing.    

52
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:16,195
  metal detectors for treasure  
    hunting have larger coils   

53
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,264
 so they don't need iron inserts
  to boost the magnetic field.  

54
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,801
    in fact, hobby detectors    
        have two coils --       

55
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,070
         one to transmit        
       and one to receive.      

56
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,740
       this configuration       
     lets you set the device    

57
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,742
    to detect only the types    
   of metal you want to find.   

58
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,611
          like before,          

59
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,382
     polyester tape prevents    
 the wound wire from unraveling.

60
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,954
   the leads go into a device   
       called a stripper,       

61
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:45,825
   which bares the copper wire  
             inside.            

62
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,359
        a testing machine       

63
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:51,197
      ensures the coil meet     
 the engineering specifications.

64
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,169
next, they place a circuit board
      in the coil housing.      

65
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,706
 a cable runs from this housing 
      to the detector head,     

66
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,441
   where components interpret   
       the coil's signals.      

67
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,911
   after installing the coils,  

68
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:10,249
   they solder the coil leads   
          to the board.         

69
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,252
   they immobilize everything   
         with hot glue,         

70
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:18,324
 then seal the components inside
     the housing with epoxy.    

71
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,525
       next, they install       
         a circuit board        

72
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,329
   inside the metal detector's  
          control pad.          

73
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,132
   they plug the cable coming   
  from the coils into the board 

74
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,067
          and power up.         

75
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,404
    this calibrates the coils   
      to the circuit board.     

76
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,810
  now they test the calibration 

77
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,678
   with three different types   
           of material          

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,413
  the metal detector might find 
        in the ground --        

79
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:45,150
    iron, silver, and nickel.   

80
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:49,221
 if everything works perfectly, 
       assembly continues.      

81
00:04:55,896 --> 00:05:00,499
  they install a small speaker  
         for the alarm.         

82
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,835
then they attach the control pad
           to the head          

83
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,970
      and apply the decals.     

84
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:12,511
    they attach a handle and    
 arm support, then a long stem. 

85
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,514
     the cable from the coil    
  winds upward around the stem  

86
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,050
            and plugs           
     into the detector head.    

87
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,385
      signals from the coil     

88
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,721
       travel up the cable      
 to the electronics in the head.

89
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,457
    a small computer analyzes   
          these signals         

90
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,794
      to determine whether      
  the detector has found metal. 

91
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,130
     if it has, the computer    
       activates a circuit      

92
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,932
      to set off the alarm      
     and display a message.     

93
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,201
        but the ground's        
     by no means the limit.     

94
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,138
 there are even metal detectors 
    designed for scuba diving   

95
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,540
that are completely submersible.

96
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,756
            narrator:           
   rum comes from by-products   
     of the sugar industry,     

97
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,158
         like molasses.         

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,294
the caribbean and latin america 
produce much of the world's rum.

99
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:05,497
   light rums are the base for  
cocktails like the minty mojito.

100
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,300
  amber rums are medium-bodied  
      and aged for flavor.      

101
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,035
  they're often drunk straight, 

102
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,372
         as is dark rum,        
  the strongest-tasting of all. 

103
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,512
       this fine amber rum      

104
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,248
         is the product         
  of a long and complex process 

105
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,419
  that begins with the harvest  
  of mature sugarcane plants.   

106
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,126
      the cut cane goes to      
 a sugar mill where they wash it

107
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:37,930
          then crush it         
   to extract its sweet juice.  

108
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,332
       they boil it down.       

109
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,133
this produces a kind of molasses

110
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,536
        that then goes on       
     to a centrifuge machine    

111
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,206
 that draws out excess moisture.

112
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,679
  rum making really beings here 
  in these distillation towers. 

113
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,850
 this is where ferment made from
 molasses distills into raw rum.

114
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,888
   to make ferment, molasses    
   mixed with water and yeast   

115
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,091
       heats in open tanks      
       for about 30 hours.      

116
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,494
       this converts sugar      
          into alcohol.         

117
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,699
    here's a sample straight    
    from one of these tanks.    

118
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:19,237
  notice that foamy top layer?  
 that's fermentation in action. 

119
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,240
 before distilling the contents 
          of the tank,          

120
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,510
technicians first test a sample.

121
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,513
      in this glass still,      
     steam heats the ferment    

122
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,448
   and releases alcohol vapors  

123
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,718
          that condense         
    at the top of the column.   

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,788
       as they travel down      
       the still's spiral,      

125
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,990
         the vapors cool        
     and condense even more.    

126
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,995
    the liquid that collects    
  in the beaker is 80% alcohol. 

127
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:46,264
      it's the same process     
 inside the distillation towers 

128
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,534
     on a much larger scale.    

129
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,342
     the ferment must reach     
     176 degrees fahrenheit     

130
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,276
    to distill into raw rum.    

131
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,279
    then it's stored in these   
    13,000-gallon containers    

132
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,750
 until they test it for quality.

133
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,685
    these gas-powered boilers   

134
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,155
     provide the steam heat     
  for the distillation towers.  

135
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,228
 workers monitor the distilling 
      towers day and night.     

136
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,830
    this facility can produce   

137
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:21,032
    more than 10,000 gallons    
        of raw rum a day,       

138
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,237
           all stored           
    in these gigantic silos.    

139
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,974
     from there, the raw rum    
 goes into charred oak barrels. 

140
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,110
      it's mixed with water     

141
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:34,680
         and left to age        
  anywhere from 1 to 12 years.  

142
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,516
the charred wood produces asters

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,719
        that give the rum       
    color, flavor, and aroma.   

144
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,090
       the longer it ages,      
  the more intense the flavor.  

145
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,593
    technicians perform tests   

146
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,196
           on a sample          
 at the distillery's laboratory,

147
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,666
       closely monitoring       
       the aging process.       

148
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,002
   first, using a hydrometer,   

149
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,370
     they measure the amount    
    of alcohol in the samples   

150
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,007
          to make sure          
 it's in the standard 50% range.

151
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,612
  next, they smell each sample  

152
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,749
          to make sure          
   the aromas are in balance.   

153
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,019
       they keep a journal      
   of all their observations.   

154
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,354
         quality control        

155
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:18,757
     is the key to producing    
a consistent, flavorful product.

156
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:23,095
        once it has aged,       
       the rum is bottled.      

157
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,763
 it's a fully automated process.

158
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,432
      first, they sterilize     
           new bottles          

159
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,234
 in a sodium-carbonate solution.

160
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,104
   then a conveyer moves them   
      to a filling station      

161
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:35,274
  that can process 150 bottles  
            a minute.           

162
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,512
     rotating wheels deliver    
  the bottles to a lever system 

163
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,982
     that raises them up to     
 the nozzles on pneumatic pumps.

164
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,886
  they fill up with rum -- more 
  than 72,000 of them each day. 

165
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,793
   next, aluminum bottle caps   
        come down a chute       

166
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,662
   right onto the bottle tops.  

167
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,131
   a piston valve pushes down   
           on the caps          

168
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,067
 and tightly seals each bottle. 

169
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,002
     next stop -- labeling.     

170
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,538
    first, a spinning roller    
          applies glue          

171
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,142
            to panels           
    set on a rotating wheel.    

172
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:14,613
  the panels pass a dispenser,  
  and a label glues onto them.  

173
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,016
  another rotating wheel grabs  
    the labels from the panel   

174
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,952
       and transfers them       
       onto the bottles.        

175
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:23,188
       sponges press them       
       neatly into place.       

176
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,960
      as the bottles convey     
  out of the labeling station,  

177
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,796
 brushes smooth out each label. 

178
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,835
   finally, the bottles lower   
     into boxes 12 at a time    

179
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,439
      to ship to customers      
      all over the world.       

180
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,459
     narrator: tiffany lamps    
   were invented and produced   

181
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,126
           by designer          
      louis comfort tiffany     

182
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,929
            starting            
    in the late 19th century.   

183
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,397
  they were renowned for their  
 elaborate stained-glass shades,

184
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,933
    crafted entirely by hand.   

185
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,136
    the term tiffany has come   
  to be used as a generic term  

186
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,405
          for any lamp          
    or hanging light fixture    

187
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,108
   with a stained-glass shade.  

188
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,148
 this lighting company produces 
 original stained-glass lamps,  

189
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,553
    as well as reproductions    
   of renown tiffany designs.   

190
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,489
         there's nothing        
       machine-made here.       

191
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:35,827
     each and every creation    
  is meticulously handcrafted.  

192
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,231
  the lamp designer first draws 
  a pencil sketch of the shade, 

193
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,900
then prepares a color rendition.

194
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,371
      he produces a pattern     
    in the lamp's actual size   

195
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,573
      and assigns a number      
     to each pattern piece,     

196
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,441
   then records by code number  

197
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,046
 the specific glass they'll use 
         for each piece.        

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,188
       next, they cut out       
  the numbered pattern pieces,  

199
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,257
            lay them            
   on the corresponding glass,  

200
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,258
  and trace them with a marker. 

201
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,863
using a glass cutter, they score
 the trace lines and snap them. 

202
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,335
    when a piece is too small   
to get enough snapping leverage,

203
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:20,305
they grip the glass with special
     pliers called groziers.    

204
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,348
next, they sand-smooth the rough
     edges of the cut pieces    

205
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,616
     so they won't puncture     

206
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:34,086
    the adhesive copper foil    
       that goes on next.       

207
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,559
   after wrapping each piece,   
  they crimp the foil tightly,  

208
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:44,096
    first with their fingers,   
    then with a flat object.    

209
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:54,772
     this design, like many,    
   incorporates glass jewels.   

210
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,310
 these come from glass suppliers
           ready-made.          

211
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,452
          the next step         
 is to coat the foil with flux, 

212
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,756
           a chemical           
  that enables solder to stick. 

213
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,525
   now with a soldering iron,   

214
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,063
  they melt tin and lead solder 
      onto the copper foil.     

215
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:21,332
    initially, they just tack   
    all the pieces together,    

216
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,935
     completing one section     
     of the shade at a time.    

217
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,204
   then they lay the sections   
          side by side          

218
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,073
    in a curved plaster mold.   

219
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:31,243
         this bends them        
      to the correct shape.     

220
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,747
           more flux.           

221
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,818
then with a soldering iron, they
tack the sections to each other,

222
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,021
 then solder the whole interior.

223
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,499
  once that's done, they remove 
     the shape from the mold    

224
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,469
 and solder the whole exterior. 

225
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,578
   now they top the shade with  
 a brass cap and solder that on.

226
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,451
      this lampshade design     

227
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,320
      features dragonflies      
   with brass filigree wings.   

228
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,190
    after soldering the wings   
            in place,           

229
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,327
   it's time for what's called  
      the final beading --      

230
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,330
        a final soldering       
 over the existing solder lines 

231
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,266
 to make them even and rounded. 

232
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,736
     now they wash the shade    
    in an antiquing solution,   

233
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,806
  which dulls the shine of both 
  the solder and the brass cap, 

234
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,576
      giving the lampshade      
          an aged look.         

235
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,012
     in another department,     

236
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,748
   they install what's called   
       the light cluster,       

237
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,350
    a rod with light sockets    
        and a pull chain,       

238
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,353
        into a lamp base.       

239
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,027
    they fish the power cord    
  up the base and out the top,  

240
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,065
  then connect the cord to the  
 wires coming from the sockets. 

241
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,372
   they tuck in the wiring...   

242
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,774
apply thread-locking solution...

243
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,112
   then screw the base closed.  

244
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,113
       for the time being,      

245
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,684
     they attach the finial     
 that goes on top of the shade. 

246
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,456
  and now a light-bulb moment.  

247
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,058
 if everything works perfectly, 

248
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,729
         the tags go on         
  and the base gets its shade.  

249
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:35,667
    the bases of the original   
 tiffanies were made of bronze. 

250
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,737
 these, both for tabletop lamps 
      and hanging fixtures,     

251
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:45,377
 are cast from zinc -- the same 
look at a fraction of the price.

252
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,893
            narrator:           
       for safety reasons,      

253
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,029
      aircraft engines have     
  built-in redundancy features, 

254
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,899
      like dual spark plugs     
    and dual ignition systems   

255
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,502
    so that vital components    
         have a backup.         

256
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,771
        rising gas prices       
        and eco awareness       

257
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:15,974
  are compelling manufacturers  
    to build aircraft engines   

258
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,677
     that are more efficient    
       and less polluting.      

259
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:26,451
 aircraft engines are remarkable
     pieces of engineering.     

260
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,856
to build a four-cylinder engine,
  a worker wraps abrasive tape  

261
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,593
 around what's called a bearing 
    journal on a crankshaft.    

262
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,899
     using a polishing jack,    

263
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:44,402
    he polishes the journal     
    to the correct diameter,    

264
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,272
        which he verifies       
    with a digital snap gage.   

265
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,544
           an operator          
      then oils the journal     

266
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,412
 and attaches a connecting rod. 

267
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,281
     these link the pistons     
       to the crankshaft,       

268
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,886
 which turns to generate power. 

269
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:04,556
 then he applies gasket sealant 
  on the edge of the crankcase  

270
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,757
         and silk thread        
     that acts like a gasket    

271
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,827
     so when the two halves     
  of the crankcase are joined,  

272
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,230
   the engine won't leak oil.   

273
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:21,038
      he places a camshaft      
 into one side of the crankcase 

274
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,910
   and measures the clearance   
 to make sure it's a tight fit. 

275
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:28,680
         then he oils it        
 to ensure there is no friction.

276
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:35,654
  they place the crankshaft and 
rod assembly into the crankcase,

277
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,956
    then join the two halves    
            together.           

278
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,729
 to prevent the connecting rods 

279
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,797
     from hitting the sides     
         of the housing,        

280
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,934
   they put on what are called  
         torque plates.         

281
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,006
    he adds a little sealant    
    to hold a gasket in place   

282
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,275
          then attaches         
      an accessory housing,     

283
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,343
    which holds all the gears   
            and hoses           

284
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,913
        that are mounted        
   on the back of the engine.   

285
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,687
      he installs the sump      
   that holds the oil supply,   

286
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:13,191
     then attaches a piston     
     to each connecting rod.    

287
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,032
    now he mounts a cylinder    
          onto a piston         

288
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,634
     and connects the parts     
         to the engine.         

289
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,038
     he'll mount and secure     
  all four cylinders this way.  

290
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,180
  he inserts hydraulic tappets  
     and then shroud tubes.     

291
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:41,986
he attaches them to the cylinder
        using a retainer.       

292
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:45,523
      he inserts a pushrod      
         into each tube         

293
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,860
      and fits a rocker arm     
    onto each rod, completing   

294
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,763
  the cylinder-and-valve-action 
            assembly.           

295
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,936
   he steam-cleans the engine.  

296
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:03,207
        then he paints it       
 with rustproofing enamel paint.

297
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,276
  next come the spark plugs --  

298
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,947
     one on the top and one     
 on the bottom of each cylinder.

299
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:16,354
  he grounds and then installs  
          two magnetos.         

300
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,824
   these devices generate the   
electricity for the spark plugs,

301
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,327
      which ignite the fuel     
        in the cylinder.        

302
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,567
he attaches the spark-plug wires

303
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,103
        from the magneto        
       to the spark plugs,      

304
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,906
then verifies the engine timing.

305
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,777
  next come the heat shields... 

306
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,379
       the intake pipes...      

307
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,650
 all the spark-plug connections 
        and drain tubes,        

308
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,253
  and finally, a fuel injector. 

309
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,592
    an operator then attaches   
       a testing propeller      

310
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,495
  to the engine to keep it cool 
         during testing.        

311
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,869
    he runs the engine using    
 controls like a pilot would use

312
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,406
  and certifies everything from 
  engine speed and temperature  

313
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,009
  to fuel pressure and airflow. 

314
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,214
          hours later,          
    he checks the oil filter    

315
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,350
  for signs of foreign material 
        or contamination.       

316
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,287
and this engine passes the test.

317
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:29,094
 a worker then puts preservative
     oil into the cylinders.    

318
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:32,964
this special oil safeguards the 
engine en route to the customer,

319
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,900
         whether they be        
 general aviation manufacturers 

320
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,770
      or individual owners.     

321
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,440
 once installed in the airplane 

322
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,443
     and after the standard     
   preflight checks are done,   

323
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,979
    the four-cylinder engine    
        allows the pilot        

324
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:52,150
 to take to the clear-blue skies
      in total confidence.
