218

the ocher ore contains about 10% pure ocher.     

219

the rest is stones and sand,  

220
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:21,139
which is why the ore requires processing.      

221
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,009
the first step is to wash it. 

222
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:29,214
this turns it into liquid unrefined ocher.        

223
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,351
next the liquid flows through sieves.        

224
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,819
then the liquid ocher flows into troughs

leading to a collection basin. 

226
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,292
pumps transfer the liquid ocher
at high pressure        

227
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,494
to the separator,       

228
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:44,963
which spins it at high speed. 

229
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,700
the centrifugal force separates the sand.      

230

over several months, the ocher 
gradually settles to the bottom.

232

workers drain the water, then collect the coarse ocher powder

233

236
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,788
the crusher would reduce blocks of ore         

237
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,394
into fist-sized pieces for the mill to grind.     

238
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,062
the ground ore would then drop through

three consecutive sieves,   

240
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,200

no more than 30 microns in size,

the consistency of flour.   

246
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,820
to make red ocher, workers put 
yellow ocher in a gas-fired oven

247
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:46,758
and bake it for 15 minutes at 1,380 degrees fahrenheit.  

248
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,428
the heat dehydrates the iron oxides,
