of the accordion        

4
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,522
appears in almost every kind of music.           

5
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,991
the piano-style keyboard on the right-hand side     

6
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,526
produces the melody,      

7
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,596
while the buttons on the left 
produce the chord accompaniment.

8
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:06,699
in between are bellows that force air through reeds, 

9
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:09,669
producing that unmistakable accordion sound.

00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,745
the accordion is a beautiful and complex instrument.    

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,881
it contains up to 10 sets of steel reeds         

13
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,817
with different pitches.    

14
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,953
each reed set goes into a wooden block.   

15
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,624
under every section is an opening called a tone hole. 

16
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,893
the bellows drives air through it,

vibrating the reed above to produce a musical note.   

18
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,633
these leather-and-plastic pads cover the slots        

19
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:44,036
on the accordion's aluminum reed plates.     

20
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,505
each plate holds two reeds.  

21
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,907
both reeds produce the same note --        

22
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,377
one when you push the bellows, the other when you pull.    

23
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,982
they now apply a special wax to
secure the reeds to the block. 

24
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,052
if they used glue, they wouldn't
be able to remove the plate

should a reed ever need repair.

26

each reed played corresponds to a specific note or chord.

to assemble the keyboard,   

28
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:14,467
they begin with a lever made of
fiberglass-reinforced plastic. 

29
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,637
it has a wooden core to give the keys sufficient weight.   

30
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,540
a long metal lever goes into the top.       

31
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,508
when the musician presses a key,

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,679
its mechanism unblocks the corresponding tone hole,  

33
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,614
allowing air to flow inside  

34
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,384
and vibrate one of the plate's two reeds.           

35
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:39,959
next, they drive in the steel axle on which the keys pivot. 

36
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,098
then they apply suction to a keyboard-size tray.    

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,034
in it, they line up the plastic key tops.

with the suction holding the keys down,     

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,714
it's just a matter of flipping the tray      

42
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,849
and clamping it onto the keyboard frame.    

43
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,518
the tops adhere to the levers, 

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,987
which have since received a coat of glue.        

45
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,190
after about an hour, the glue is dry.        

46
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:16,395
they cut the suction, and the keyboard is finger-ready. 

47
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,997
meanwhile, the reed blocks   

48
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,465
are in the hands of a tuning specialist,    

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,268
who pumps air with a foot pedal

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,336

starting with the valves,   

56
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,685
they install a wooden pallet over each tone hole.      

57
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,154
to that, they glue a steel lever.    

58
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,526
then to that, they connect a brass rake.   

59
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,898
when the rake moves, it pulls the lever,       

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,102
which opens the valve, unblocking the tone hole.   

61
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:59,371
air enters and vibrates the reed, producing the note. 

62
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,244
each keyboard button opens three valves.       

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,915
that's why pushing one button produces a three-note chord.

just enough to ensure the slices are chewy.     

152
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,117
from the oven to packaging.  

153
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,120
these preservative-free dried pineapple slices     

154
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,722
stay fresh in the package for 18 months.         

155
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,339
now back to the pineapple factory,   

156
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,477
where the first-class fruits pass under a shower of hot wax.

157
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,279
fans cool and harden the wax  

158
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,882
into a coating that creates an air barrier.  

159
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,951
this slows the ripening process,

160
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,419
ensuring the pineapples don't overripen        

161
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,556
by the time they arrive at their export destination.  

162
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,626
last stop is the packaging and labeling department.    

163
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,695
workers box pineapples with and without crowns separately. 

164
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,365
those with crowns are for export.        

165
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,434
the crownless ones go to a canning factory    

166
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,837
to be sliced, diced, or crushed.

167
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,240
from the field to your table, 

168
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,776
pineapples are the fruit of many people's labors.    

169
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,992
narrator: artificial body parts     

170
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,128
used to be the stuff of science fiction.       

171
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,597
nowadays artificial joints, at least, are routine.     

172
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,800
an artificial joint is a prosthesis that surgeons insert

173
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,736
to replace diseased or worn-out
bone and cartilage.      

174
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,139
in nearly all cases, an artificial joint       

175
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,342
relieves pain and improves the range of motion.      

176
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:25,017
from your knees and hips to your
wrists, elbow, and shoulders, 

177
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,953
if your joints go, you can replace them.     

178
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,423
an artificial joint has both metal and plastic components. 

179
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,694
the metal acts as bone, the plastic is cartilage.   

180
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,763
this factory makes the metal parts three ways.  

181
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,167
it either casts them, forges them, or machines them. 

182
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,569
casting is the most complex method.            

183
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,105
the first step is to pressure-inject melted wax 

184
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,907
into an aluminum mold.     

185
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,178
this makes a pattern,     
a wax replica of the metal part.

186
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,449
now they build the mold for casting the part in metal. 

187
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,785
workers fuse a group of patterns
with hot wax          

188
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,321
to a holder also made of wax. 

189
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,691
the patterns will shape the cavity in the molds.    

190
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,065
they submerge the patterns in a thick liquid ceramic    

191
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:17,736
which soon hardens into a fragile shell around the wax.

192
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,604
then they sprinkle the shell  

193
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,806
with a mixture of two minerals --       

194
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:26,345
silica sand and zircon -- to build up a strengthening crust.

195
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:30,282
the shells now go into a furnace
for about two hours.      

196
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:34,552
the intense heat hardens them and incinerates the wax inside,

197
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,089
leaving a cavity in the pattern shape.     

198
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,623
the shells are now molds    

199
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,292
strong enough to withstand molten metal.         

200
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,762
that metal is cobalt chrome.  

201
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,966
in this crucible, the chrome liquefies in about 10 minutes. 

202
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,969
they remove the molds from the furnace        

203
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,574
and lock them to the top of another one above the crucible.

204
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,111
then they flip it over.    

205
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:02,381
the molten metal flows from the crucible into the molds.  

206
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,516
it solidifies within two minutes.      

207
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,652
then they transfer the hot molds
to a cooling bin.       

208
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,255
cold air flows around them for about two hours      

209
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,991
until they're finally cool enough to handle.       

210
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,993
then workers mount each tree on an automated machine    

211
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,662
that works like a jackhammer. 

212
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,667
each mold disintegrates, freeing
the cast-metal part inside.  

213
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,806
they use a saw to separate the parts from the tree,    

214
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,809
then a grinding belt to remove any unnecessary metal     

215
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,145
that hardened in the channels. 

216
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,885
next, they laser-engrave a unique serial number     

217
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,487
on each part for tracking purposes.     

218
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,490
every part undergoes a thorough inspection.     

219
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,959
they dust the part with fluorescent powder,    

220
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,093
then rinse it off.       

221
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,763
powder residue settles in any flaw          

222
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,565
and glows under ultraviolet light.    

223
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,302
after inspection, they buff every part      

224
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,840
until the metal's so shiny, you can see a reflection.   

225
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,310
another method for making metal parts is forging.    

226
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,111
they use a titanium alloy,   

227
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,781
which is more flexible than cobalt chrome,      

228
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,251
making it better suited for hip joints, in particular. 

229
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:17,322
they clean the metal, then heat
it in a 2,200-degree furnace. 

230
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,925
this 660-ton press forms one piece at a time   

231
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,994
into a preliminary shape.   

232
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,330
then they move it to the next die and stamp twice

233
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,067
to refine and then finalize the shape.  

234
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,137
the last stamping on the third die        

235
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,308
trims off excess metal and adds detail.        

236
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,280
the forged part now goes into a sandblasting chamber  

237
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,550
which cleans the metal and gives
the surface a matte finish.  

238
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:52,356
here's what the part looks like
before sandblasting and after. 

239
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,826
now a computer-guided milling machine        

240
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,561
smooths away the rough edge  

241
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,364
that trimming the excess metal left behind.          

242
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,833
this removes all but the last bit,     

243
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,036
so they get rid of that with a sanding belt.      

244
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,372
but sanding leaves metal residue behind.     

245
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,175
so the parts now go for a bath 

246
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,377
in a water-based citric solution.        

247
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,179
the metal surface has to be perfectly clean   

248
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,450
in order to stamp on the serial number in ink.   

249
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:22,787
quite a difference before cleaning and after.   

250
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:26,057
each and every metal part, whether forged or cast,    

251
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,593
goes to the quality control department.          

252
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,595
there, using digital calipers, 

253
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,265
an inspector checks all the dimensions,      

254
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,135
then examines the part under a magnifying glass.   

255
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,070
so far we've seen two of the ways          

256
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,740
they make the metal parts of an artificial joint --   

257
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,741
casting and forging.      

258
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,578
the third method is coming right up.      

259
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,963
narrator: the metal portion of an artificial joint      

260
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,097
plays the role of bone,    

261
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,099
while the plastic portion mimics cartilage.       

262
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,303
however, the plastic isn't your run-of-the-mill plastic. 

263
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,971
it's medical-grade polyethylene,

264
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,506
meaning it's formulated to be lightweight,       

265
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,974
but also extremely durable   

266
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,745
so that it withstands years of wear and tear within the body. 

267
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,783
the type of metal they use   

268
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,318
to make the bone portion of an artificial joint     

269
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,854
depends on how flexible that joint has to be.     

270
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,123
a knee joint requires less elasticity,   

271
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,325
so they mold it out of cobalt chrome.     

272
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,196
a hip joint, on the other hand,
needs to be more bendable.   

273
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,464
so for that, they use titanium.

274
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,134
they either forge the shape in a press           

275
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,805
or mount the titanium block on a computer-guided mill.   

276
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,873
under a steady shower of lubricant,         

277
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,209
the mill's 20-odd machining tools        

278
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,079
carve the block from all angles.

279
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,481
after a primary rough machining,

280
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:00,151
the mill's precision tools finalize the shape.      

281
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,753
from start to finish,     

282
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,890
machining just one part takes about half an hour.   

283
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,225
now a robot takes over.    

284
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,562
it runs the part against a series of sanding belts,   

285
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,964
their grits progressing from rough to fine.      

286
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:16,634
this removes marks the machining
tools left on the metal    

287
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,538
and polishes the surface to a mirror finish.      

288
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,977
the robot can't reach the edges,

289
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:31,349
so a worker sands them manually
and verifies the dimensions.  

290
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,624
then the parts go for a thorough cleaning.    

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,335
the factory puts random samples
through wear testing.     

292
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,804
the machines simulate joint movement,        

293
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,805
complete with fake joint fluid.

294
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,209
the factory sprays some parts with titanium powder      

295
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,811
to help bone tissue to cling to them.       

296
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,281
this machine, called an optical comparator, 

297
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,817
projects an image of the part's coated outline  

298
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,752
against a technically perfect template.           

299
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:11,289
the technician makes sure   
the part and the template match.

300
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,027
to become an artificial joint, 

301
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,030
the metal bone now needs its plastic cartilage.     

302
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,299
that requires polyethylene powder.      

303
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,102
a technician weighs out a specific amount,       

304
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,571
puts it in the outer sleeve of a mold,           

305
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,040
then inserts the mold's inner piece.    

306
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,776
the technician loads the mold into a press          

307
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,447
that applies both pressure and heat --          

308
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,849
374 degrees fahrenheit.    

309
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,522
the powder gets squeezed between the mold's two parts  

310
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,625
and turns into solid plastic. 

311
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,399
using various instruments, they measure the molded part  

312
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,169
to ensure all its dimensions are exact.           

313
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:04,008
now a computer-guided machining
tool carves the grooves    

314
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,077
into which the metal part will slide.          

315
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,848
these details are far too intricate for a mold to shape. 

316
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:23,427
then some final measurements to make sure the finished part 

317
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,497
adheres to the engineering specifications.        

318
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,437
random samples undergo fatigue testing        

319
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,940
equivalent to 10 years of wear.

320
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,780
some plastic parts are just too
complex to be molded outright, 

321
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,983
so, instead, the factory molds a block of plastic,      

322
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:46,250
then machines it.       

323
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,985
the block spins on a lathe   

324
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,622
as various computer-guided tools
shape it.           

325
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,928
samples of these also undergo wear testing.   

326
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,264
after a specific number of movements          

327
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,799
over a specific time period,  

328
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,802
technicians remove the parts and weigh them.        

329
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,937
by comparing to the starting weight,    

330
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,672
they can calculate how much plastic has worn off.     

331
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,477
the packaging room is what they call a clean room,

332
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,146
meaning the air runs through a filter system    

333
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,881
to keep out dust and dirt.   

334
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,018
workers pack the artificial joints against foam      

335
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,953
to protect the metal surface, 

336
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,724
because even the tiniest scratch
can cause premature wear.   

337
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,427
after heat-sealing the packages,

338
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,630
the factory ships them off to a sterilization plant.    

339
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,899
there, powerful gamma rays penetrate           

340
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,501
right through the packaging  

341
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:39,704
and kill off any bacteria that might be lurking inside. 

342
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:47,244
make no bones about it, these joints may be artificial,

343
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,382
but the movement they restore is as real as it gets.     

344
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,662
