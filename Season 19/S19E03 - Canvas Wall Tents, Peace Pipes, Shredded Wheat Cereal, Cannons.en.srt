taken about eight days to       

523
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,563
produce this full-scale replica 

524
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,600
of a revolutionary war cannon.  

525
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,468
it's now ready for a little     

526
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:15,807
historical re-enacting.         

527
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,808
it's sure to be a hit with the  

528
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,544
troops.
