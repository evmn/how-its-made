00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,156
narrator: today, on "how it's made"...

00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,204

6
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,548
9                

7
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,454
thinner than a human hair,    

8
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,390
ultrathin glass flexes like plastic.          

9
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,993
it can also have greater electrical sensitivity,     

10
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,327
making it useful for things   

11
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,398
like fingerprint scanning on smartphones.         

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,867
manufacturers have only just begun       

13
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:12,471
to explore the potential of this new class of glass.   

14
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,809
when it comes to sheer flexibility,      

15
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,544
thin is in.           

16
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,546
ultrathin glass bends like a sheet of paper      

17
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:26,552
and a chemical process ensures that it's extremely robust.   

18
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,086
to make ultrathin glass,     

19
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,222
manufacturers use standard materials,     

20
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:34,426
such as lime, sand, soda, and potash.        

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,762
they store the ingredients in separate silos,        

22
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,632
until it's time for production.           

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,169
then, inside the factory, a long cable           

24
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:47,440
delivers electricity to power a weigh cart.      

25
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:51,310
as the dry ingredients flow out of the silos and down chutes,  

26
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:55,781
the cart moves forward to collect them.         

27
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,183
it weighs the ingredients    

28
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:00,453
until it has the correct amounts for the glass recipe       

29
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,755
and then closes the lid automatically.      

30
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,861
a worker measures the secondary, smaller, ingredients manually  

31
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,863
and adds them to the batch.   

32
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,133
these ingredients enhance qualities        

33
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,137
like optical clarity or electrical sensitivity.    

34
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,840
the cart transfers the batch to a mixer.      

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,411
as it blends everything together,       

36
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,748
they add bits of broken, or waste, glass to it      

37
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,216
for recycling purposes.     

38
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,489
once it's been thoroughly mixed, a lift raises          

39
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,493
a funnel-shaped container up to the base of the mixer   

40
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,496
and the mixer releases the batch into it.        

41
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,469
a worker hauls the batch-laden funnel tank to the next station.            

42
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,240
there, a crane takes over and lowers the tank       

43
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:59,045
onto a feeder system just above a gas-and-electric furnace.   

44
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,915
a trapdoor opens at the funnel's base       

45
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,319
and the mixture flows into the feeder mechanism.    

46
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,255
it's a kind of shovel      
that slowly pushes the mixture  

47
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,657
into the furnace,        

48
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:17,196
which has been fired      
to a blazing 2,732 fahrenheit.  

49
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,931
the shovel continuously adds more ingredients      

50
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,401
to keep production flowing.   

51
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,605
glass production runs 24/7.   

52
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:31,277
the melting glass reaches the consistency of honey.    

53
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,346
the molten glass flows out through a narrow slit      

54
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,082
and this slit establishes    

55
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:39,819
the ultrathin dimensions of the glass.          

56
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,419
cooling the glass slowly     

57
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:46,559
relieves internal stresses as the glass solidifies.     

58
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,095
ultrathin glass can be just 25 microns thick.      

59
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,230
that's finer than a hair.    

60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,501
and it's this thinness that makes it so flexible.    

61
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,704
the glass bends to loop down and up across rollers    

62
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,106
as it journeys forward      

63
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:03,776
in a continuous, nearly 2-foot-wide sheet     

64
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:08,313
and, unlike ordinary glass, it doesn't crack.        

65
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,517
it then travels past      
tiny cameras and laser sensors  

66
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,253
that look for defects, like bubbles.          

67
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,922
a computer maps any flaws, so they can be avoided      

68
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,558
when the glass is cut into smaller pieces.       

69
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,728
a revolving spool rolls up the glass,       

70
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,331
along with a plastic liner,   

71
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:29,735
which keeps the glass layers from sticking to one another.  

72
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:34,340
once 546 yards of thin glass  
has been wound onto the spool,  

73
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,475
an automated system cuts the glass          

74
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:40,946
and slides the spool partway off the core and onto a rack.  

75
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,282
the operator gives it a push to complete the transfer            

76
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,953
and then rolls the rack to the next station.       

77
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,023
a lab technician slices off a fragment of the glass     

78
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,759
and inserts it in a micrometer.           

79
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,895
it gauges the thickness of the specimen         

80
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:58,164
and confirms that it's superthin.       

81
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,035
another lab worker places a bigger segment of the glass  

82
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,571
under a cutter.         

83
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,041
he aligns it correctly     
and then activates the cutter.  

84
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:12,444
it scribes the glass, so it can be broken on this line,   

85
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:16,682
creating small screens for smartphones and smartwatches.  

86
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,989
a lab technician examines the glass for scratches     

87
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,159
under a bright light and confirms that it's undamaged.  

88
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,398
with that out of the way,    
it's time to have a little fun  

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,801
with a strip of this ultrathin glass.     

90
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:40,105
a worker bends it into a circle and ties it.    

91
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,341
it's hard to believe this is glass.          

92
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,278
later, a chemical treatment   

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,148
will further strengthen the ultrathin glass,       

94
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,053
so that the chance of cracks or breaks will be very thin.   

95
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,268
102               

96
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,239
when wooden shipping pallets break and need repair,      

97
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,242
or outlive their usefulness, they can be taken apart     

98
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:21,313
by pallet-dismantling machines, which saw through the nails   

99
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,449
to separate the wood blocks and planks.        

100
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,585
salvageable pieces become new pallets,       

101
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:32,191
while broken pieces go into a wood chipper.       

102
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:36,262
with its powerful band saw, this pallet-dismantling machine             

103
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,130
slices through the nails that fasten           

104
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:43,201
the pallet's wood blocks to its transversal planks.    

105
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,604
the machine's shell, the equivalent          

106
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,208
of the body panels on a car, is made of steel sheets.     

107
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,145
a computer-guided laser cutter cuts them to the required shape.             

108
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,621
then, workers bend the ends on a brake press         

109
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,759
to make edges          
with perfectly formed corners.  

110
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,895
once shaped, the shell parts go to a paint shop.       

111
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,434
workers build the structure of the machine          

112
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,369
out of heavy-duty steel tubes.  

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,375
after sawing them to the length required,     

114
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,545
they smooth the rough-cut edge with a hand-grinder.       

115
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,384
workers mark where they have to make openings    

116
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,054
for various parts and drill the holes.       

117
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,398
they weld the tubes together to assemble the structure.    

118
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,142
they clean the surface with acid              
to remove traces of lubricant.  

119
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,978
then, they spray paint the structure.          

120
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,350
the workers assemble the mechanical parts       

121
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,086
to the structure.        

122
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:10,956
they bolt on a plate to support            
the machine's electric engine.  

123
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,160
then, on each side, they install a wheel.      

124
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,164
next, workers install the motor reducer.    

125
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,501
to that, they bolt the machine's 2,800-rpm engine.             

126
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,705
the motor reducer decreases the speed of the engine     

127
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,609
to the sawing speed required to dismantle the pallet.     

128
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,048
just above the tires on both sides,          

129
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,318
they bolt a blade guide to the structure.        

130
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,656
they install the front of the machine's shell      

131
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,126
and lower the machine's heavy, steel worktable.         

132
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:53,731
now, the band-saw blade, which has a safety cover     

133
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,669
over its sharp teeth until the machine is operational.   

134
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,471
on each side of the worktable,  

135
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,874
workers align the blade with a tire           

136
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,811
and insert it between the wheels of the blade guide.       

137
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,213
the blade is steel, with carbide tips        

138
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,616
for added strength and resistance to wear.     

139
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:16,288
they turn this bolt to adjust the tension.      

140
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,556
they enclose the tire and blade guides         

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,060
in the side sections of the machine's shell.     

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,634
then, workers install two pneumatic cylinders     

143
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,703
for raising and lowering a safety cage          

144
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:36,241
that goes over the worktable to protect the machine operator.            

145
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,844
next, another pneumatic cylinder,       

146
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,346
this one, at the rear for the machine's guide arm.   

147
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,459
the guide arm, installed next, helps move the pallet around   

148
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,096
while the machine's band-saw blade cuts it apart.  

149
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:08,540
they install the safety cage over the worktable,       

150
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,276
then hook up the cables that feed compressed air     

151
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,412
to the pneumatic cylinders.   

152
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:19,952
they install another safety cage over the back of the machine,  

153
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,888
then, a pressure regulator for pneumatic cylinders.     

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,765
they mount the machine's control panel on the shell.   

155
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,968
it's wired to the engine and pneumatic system,      

156
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,172
as well as a set of foot pedals that moves the table up and down              

157
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,643
and another pedal that moves the guide arm.    

158
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,512
the operator places the pallet on the worktable         

159
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,915
and lowers the safety cage.   

160
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,584
with the foot pedal, he moves the arm to the right  

161
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,120
to angle the pallet against the blade.        

162
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,255
this lets it slice through multiple nails      

163
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,725
holding the wood planks and blocks together.       

164
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,340
178               

165
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,410
often frosted and adorned with sprinkles,   

166
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:22,947
a cupcake is a sugary indulgence that you don't have to share.  

167
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,083
we don't really know who invented them,        

168
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,286
but cupcakes have been around for a century or more,      

169
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,754
much to the satisfaction of those             

170
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,257
who want a little cake all to themselves.        

171
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,831
these minicupcakes       
are the sweetest little things  

172
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,233
and there's plenty for everyone            

173
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,602
because they're mass-produced in a factory.          

174
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,374
the dairy and nut-free recipe starts with canola oil.     

175
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,712
a worker pours a measured amount into a huger mixer bowl.     

176
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,180
a blend of baking power, sea salt,            

177
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,052
and other microingredients is next.             

178
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,188
he then adds a big bag of sugar.       

179
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,927
they'll be making 15,000 minicupcakes in this batch.   

180
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,999
pastry flour flows into the mixer from a silo nearby.  

181
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,935
he adds cocoa, for chocolate flavoring,     

182
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,940
then, activates the mixer, to blend it all together.    

183
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,542
next are the eggs.        

184
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,945
they'll act as a binding agent for the chocolate batter     

185
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,415
and will have a leavening effect during baking.      

186
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,353
a quick mix folds the eggs into the chocolatey blend.    

187
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:38,357
a pump now transfers the batter to the next station.       

188
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,426
the bakery's temperature is critical during pumping.   

189
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,563
too warm, and the mixture will be too thin to pump.    

190
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,399
too cool, and it will be too thick.    

191
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,502
the pump delivers the batter to a hopper.     

192
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:55,574
down the line a bit, a conveyor moves baking trays forward.   

193
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,576
a machine uses suctioning devices        

194
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:01,179
to pick up paper liners, flip them right-side-up,     

195
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,415
and insert them in the baking trays.       

196
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,854
valves open and dispense the batter in the hopper     

197
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:14,726
into the cupcake liners in the pans.           

198
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,928
the system controls the flow of batter,       

199
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,666
so it only fills the liners one-third of the way.      

200
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:25,203
this leaves room for the cake to rise during baking.      

201
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,005
the pans move through different levels,        

202
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,674
with a range of temperature zones       

203
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,143
over a period of 25 minutes,   

204
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,346
finally emerging from the other side.       

205
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,553
during baking, the cupcakes have risen above the liners.   

206
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,557
they now head into a cooling chamber.     

207
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,559
they stay in here for 20 minutes,         

208
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,729
while fans blow air onto them to cool them down.        

209
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,402
the cooling firms up the cakes.             

210
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,643
a robot plunges pinlike tentacles into the cupcakes   

211
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:09,047
to lift them out of the pans with the paper liners attached.            

212
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,850
it transfers them to the packaging conveyor line.              

213
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,589
workers pack them in clamshell plastic containers,       

214
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,291
a dozen to each one.       

215
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,996
they leave the containers open       

216
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,933
because they still need to decorate these cupcakes.   

217
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,338
ahead, fluffy chocolate icing flows      

218
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,474
out of a hopper into applicators.        

219
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,214
they deposit the icing in a swirl onto the cupcakes,  

220
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,485
adding nearly an inch of height and a lot more sweetness.    

221
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,024
down the line, workers load sugary sprinkles  

222
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,694
into another hopper.       

223
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,962
a feeder dispenses a few more of the sprinkles   

224
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,065
onto each of the frosted cupcakes.     

225
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,138
the containers then ride by a rail that folds the lids over.              

226
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,511
a pusher device presses down on the lids to close them tightly.            

227
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,518
the containers of minicupcakes then meet up with a roller    

228
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,920
that applies the adhesive-backed labeling.    

229
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,193
before the cupcakes can leave the factory,      

230
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:33,265
a technician tests a sample from the production line.    

231
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,733
he crumbles some of the cake into pods      

232
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,735
and places them in a machine.  

233
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,873
the machine probes the water  
content at a microscopic level  

234
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,810
to determine if the cupcake is moist enough.         

235
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:50,014
another test evaluates the cupcake's texture.      

236
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,518
when the samples pass this technological scrutiny,   

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,655
the cupcakes are ready for human taste buds.      

238
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,504
as a component of mechanical equipment,     

239
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,374
seamless tube is stronger, and therefore more resistant   

240
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,978
to pressure and tension, than tube with a welded seam.  

241
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,914
that's because seamless tube is manufactured         

242
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,116
from a solid bar of stainless steel,       

243
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,918
rather than from a strip of stainless           

244
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,522
that's rolled and welded into a tube.     

245
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,124
seamless stainless-steel tube  

246
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,460
is used when reliability is critical;           

247
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,930
for example, in aerospace engines,      

248
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,734
nuclear equipment, and medical devices.       

249
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,203
the manufacturer purchases stainless-steel tubes      

250
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:49,741
in a range of lengths, diameters, and thicknesses.   

251
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,010
workers select the right starting size          

252
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:56,480
for the specific tube the customer has ordered.    

253
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,351
they check the length with a measuring tape,      

254
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,054
then use a large micrometer to measure the outside diameter.            

255
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,298
they switch to a smaller micrometer     

256
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,866
to measure the wall thickness.  

257
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,775
then, they weigh the tubes.   

258
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,111
if the raw material meets all the specs,          

259
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,513
production can begin.      

260
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:32,984
they insert one end of each tube into this rotary swager.     

261
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,520
it shapes the end to a point,  

262
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,290
to enable it to fit through   
a die with a smaller diameter.  

263
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:43,594
workers spread lubricant into a steel bar,        

264
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,064
insert it into the other end of the tube,         

265
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,601
then insert the pointed end through a draw die.       

266
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:53,137
this carriage then grabs the protruding point       

267
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,805
and draws the full length of the tube           

268
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,677
through the die and over the steel bar.     

269
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,680
the die reduces the tube    
to a smaller outside diameter,  

270
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,483
while the bar sets the desired inside diameter.   

271
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:11,088
the tube walls thin out and the              
tube elongates in the process.  

272
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,158
the next machine's two rollers  

273
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,162
apply pressure to the outside of the tube as it passes.    

274
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:21,166
this expands the tube slightly, creating a slight gap      

275
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,802
between the tube walls and the bar inside.       

276
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,576
this enables the next machine to extract the bar.       

277
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,520
finally, workers saw the point off the tube.     

278
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,467
they place several tubes at a time in a degreasing unit,              

279
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,403
which uses a cleaning solution to remove all traces       

280
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:03,541
of lubricant the tubes picked up during the draw process.     

281
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,744
workers then transfer the tubes to drying tanks,         

282
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,615
positioning them at a slight downward angle.   

283
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,751
as air blows through the tubes for about a half hour,      

284
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,522
all of the cleaning solution either drains or evaporates.   

285
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,429
to further clean the inside of the tubes,     

286
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,232
workers insert a felt wad into each one,          

287
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,401
then squirt in some cleaning solvent.        

288
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,441
they shoot in compressed air to force the wad down the tube.              

289
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,843
as the wad travels the length of the tube,     

290
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,746
it wipes the inside wall with the cleaning solvent.    

291
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,718
next, workers strap the tubes to a belt    

292
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,122
that takes them on a 30-minute trip through a furnace.     

293
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:55,726
the temperature inside is more than 1,800 fahrenheit.      

294
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,863
this intense heat softens the steel,        

295
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,532
which had hardened as a result  

296
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,802
of having been pulled through the draw die earlier.  

297
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:08,672
this process is called annealing and it slightly warps the tubes,             

298
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,744
so, next, they pass through a straightening machine.     

299
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,613
then, the entire cycle repeats,            

300
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,082
until it's reduced to precisely the diameter    

301
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:21,752
and wall thickness the customer ordered.      

302
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,088
the finished tube can be     

303
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,225
up to 40 times its original starting length.  

304
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,161
to ensure the structural integrity of each tube,     

305
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,296
workers run an electrical current      

306
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,031
around the circumference.    

307
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,634
a break in the current indicates a defect,       

308
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,903
which workers then cut out with a saw     

309
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,372
before cutting the tube into the specific lengths    

310
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,842
the customer ordered.      

311
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:47,112
the saw cuts leave burns, rough edges,           

312
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:50,782
so workers insert the cut ends in a deburring machine      

313
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,718
which grinds the edges smooth.  

314
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,455
the last step is to submerge  
the tubes in an acid solution,  

315
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:01,659
to remove any iron particles  
picked up from the processing.  

316
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,929
this prevents the tubes from rusting.          

317
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:09,133
in addition to inspecting every tube that leaves the factory,  

318
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,736
quality-control testing of random samples        

319
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:16,307
ensures the product meets all technical specifications.
