00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:27,960
          pasta dies.           

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,766
         blueberries.           

7
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,972
      composting toilets.

00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,878
     and surge arresters.       

9
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,988
   industrial pasta machines    
        produce noodles         

10
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,858
       by extruding dough       
        through a die.          

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,526
   the die has holes in it,     

12
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:04,062
  which are shaped to produce   
   a specific type of pasta.    

13
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,797
       as the dough comes       
       through the holes        

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,532
    in a continuous stream,     

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,636
     a knife cuts the pasta     
    to the correct length.      

16
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,809
   this industrial pasta die    
       produces fusilli,        

17
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:20,212
      up to one and a half      
     tons of it per hour.       

18
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,815
   and this is just a midsize   
              die.              

19
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:27,153
  the largest ones can produce  
 four tons of pasta per hour.   

20
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:31,023
     the die block is made      
  of a bronze-aluminum alloy.   

21
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,293
   a computer-guided machine    
   drills holes for inserts     

22
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,162
 through which the pasta dough  
       will be extruded.        

23
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,632
     the front of the block     
     is then chrome plated      

24
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,566
           to protect           
    against the sharp knife     

25
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,637
     that cuts the extruded     
      pasta off the die.        

26
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,106
    the next step is to make    
            inserts             

27
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,775
      that go in the holes      
         in the block.          

28
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,845
     an insert is comprised     
   of male and female parts     

29
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,915
and a nonstick plastic lining.  

30
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,184
     a computer-guided mill     
       cuts the linings         

31
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:02,254
          from a plate          
     of nonstick plastic.       

32
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,588
 another computer-guided mill   

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,191
            machines            
the female part of the inserts  

34
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,629
     in a more than quarter     
 of an inch-thick brass plate.  

35
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,336
 then a worker places a lining  
     in each female part.       

36
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:27,279
    he taps it into position    
   with a mallet and punch.     

37
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,748
         the plate then         
    goes back on the mill,      

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,618
    which cuts an extrusion     
      slot in the lining.       

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,490
   the slot shape determines    
       the pasta shape.         

40
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,025
        a mill machines         
 the male part of the inserts   

41
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,429
    in another brass plate.     

42
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,231
       a worker detaches        
 the male parts from the plate  

43
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,568
   with a punch and mallet.     

44
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,205
  he detaches the lined female  
      parts the same way.       

45
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,579
   then he assembles the male   
       and female parts         

46
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,750
 by forcing one onto the other  
    with the help of a steel    
             punch.             

47
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,327
   he finishes the die insert   
 by cutting off the protruding  

48
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,329
  excess plastic with a blade   

49
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,765
       so that the lining       
    is flush with the top.      

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,337
 the factory makes die inserts  

51
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,405
        in thousands of         
      different shapes --       

52
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,874
        some standard,          

53
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,078
     others in the client's     
   custom-made pasta shape.     

54
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,617
   this computer-guided lathe   
              makes             
      brass locking rings       

55
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,053
       which will secure        
   the inserts in the block.    

56
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,235
  now, final assembly begins.   

57
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,770
        a worker places         
     the block face-down,       

58
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,105
    and from the back drops     

59
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,042
      an insert top-first       
        into each hole.         

60
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,182
   next, he places a locking    
      ring in each hole.        

61
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,593
     then, with a hydraulic     
       press and punch,         

62
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,796
   he forces down each locking  
              ring              
    to within approximately     

63
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,565
          1 millimeter          
   of the insert underneath.    

64
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,675
   in this position, the ring   
              holds             
    the insert in the hole      

65
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:41,079
     but doesn't prevent it     
from spinning within the hole.  

66
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,416
         the next step          
   is to adjust the inserts     

67
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,286
         to make their          
     orientation uniform.       

68
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,489
        he inserts a pin        
    into each insert slot.      

69
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,626
    then he rotates the pin     
     to rotate the insert.      

70
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,361
  once the insert orientation   
          is correct,           

71
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,762
  he forces the locking ring    

72
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,234
        down all the way        
   to immobilize the insert.    

73
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,103
  once he has all the inserts   
    oriented the same way,      

74
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,973
   he sands the chrome-plated   
       front of the die,        

75
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,310
first with a medium-grit disk,  

76
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,046
      then with a fine-grit     
           sandpaper.           

77
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:18,049
 the die surface must be smooth 
     as silk for the knife      

78
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:22,254
          to slice off          
  the extruded pasta cleanly.   

79
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:26,458
 he verifies the width of every 
 extrusion slot with a gauge.   

80
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
          this ensures          
     every piece of pasta       

81
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,096
will be the correct thickness.  

82
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,335
        then on the back        
     of the finished die,       

83
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,805
           he stamps            
   the manufacturer's name.     

84
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,475
 the die is ready to be mounted 
   on an industrial machine     

85
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,678
      that extrudes dough       
    into perfectly shaped,      

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,947
     ready-to-boil pasta.       

87
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,297
  narrator: blueberries are one 
               of               
  nature's healthiest foods.    

88
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:08,434
    they're low in calories,    
    packed with vitamin c,      

89
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,369
   and full of antioxidants.    

90
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,038
    and freezing blueberries    
      doesn't compromise        

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
any of that nutritional value.  

92
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,844
    north and south america     

93
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,246
          grow most of          
   the world's blueberries.     

94
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,316
   the length of the harvest    
      varies by climate.        

95
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,052
         in the south,          
 it spans april to september.   

96
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:31,256
         further north,         
    mid-june to mid-august.     

97
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,325
    at this state-of-the-art    
        blueberry farm,         

98
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,593
    a mechanical harvester      

99
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,928
       straddles the row        
      of blueberry plants       

100
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,400
     and shakes the leaves      
    with vibrating fingers.     

101
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:46,138
        the berries fall        
    to a sloped floor below     

102
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,041
       and roll down into       
     side conveyor belts.       

103
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:56,081
   the belts dump the berries   
       into onboard bins        

104
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,216
     which trucks transport     
        from the field          

105
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,687
 to the on-site packing plant.  

106
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,756
       the plant has two        
 separate production lines --   

107
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,492
     one for berries to be      
      shipped out fresh,        

108
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,296
    and this one for berries    
   to be shipped out frozen.    

109
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,631
     workers empty the bins     
        into a hopper,          

110
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,402
    which feeds the berries     
     onto a conveyor belt.      

111
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,106
   a vibrating conveyor belt    

112
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,241
    then ferries the berries    
        under a blower          

113
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:27,312
     that suctions up loose     
       leaves and twigs.        

114
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,316
  then the blueberries tumble   
       down a waterfall.        

115
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:34,119
    stones and debris settle    
        in the ledges.          

116
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,855
   the berries land in a wash   
             tank.              

117
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,257
     most of the ripe ones      
      sink to the bottom        

118
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,127
    while most of the unripe    
       ones float on top        

119
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,864
    where workers can easily    
        scoop them out.         

120
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,932
        the berries exit        
         the wash tank          

121
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,070
           with fewer           
    unripe ones among them.     

122
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:55,007
     the mesh belt vibrates     
  to gently shake off water.    

123
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,274
   then it runs the berries     

124
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,745
       through the first        
     of two color sorters.      

125
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:03,415
 the machine's camera is preset 
   to ignore the color blue     

126
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,152
and detect only green and red.  

127
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,287
        whenever a green        
     or red berry passes,       

128
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,290
   the camera sends a signal    
        to the computer         

129
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,626
identifying its exact location  

130
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,162
   so that one of the 136 air   
              jets              

131
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:22,101
     blows it off the belt      
 to a collection trough below.  

132
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:23,435
   the ripe blueberries fly     

133
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,637
          over the top          
     onto a conveyor belt       

134
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,575
        that takes them         
    to the freezer tunnel.      

135
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:34,380
     the temperature inside     
       is minus 29 degrees      
          fahrenheit.           

136
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,115
   five to 7 minutes later,     

137
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:40,652
        the berries exit        
   the tunnel frozen solid.     

138
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:44,656
    workers perform a final     
      visual inspection.        

139
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,658
     after passing through      
       a metal detector,        

140
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,528
     the berries drop into      
     a preprogrammed scale      

141
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,098
  that weighs out the specific  
   quantity being packaged.     

142
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:58,870
 meanwhile, in an on-site lab,  
 government-trained inspectors  

143
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,541
   pull samples off the line    
 every 20 minutes for grading,  

144
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,410
      which they determine      
     by assessing factors       

145
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:08,813
         such as color,         
      aroma, and defects.       

146
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,216
       the frozen berries       
       go into a freezer        

147
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:15,354
       until shipped out        
       by freezer truck.        

148
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:16,955
   the fresh berry production   
              line              

149
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,823
is similar to the frozen line,  

150
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,291
      minus the wash tank       

151
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,094
        and, of course,         
      the freeze tunnel.        

152
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,230
   however, the color sorters   
         on this line           

153
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,900
   are even more high-tech.     

154
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,768
     not only are they set      
         to detect red          

155
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,303
      and green berries,        

156
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,572
       but they also have       
     a firmness detector,       

157
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,906
 which by bouncing each berry   

158
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,510
     on a pad can identify      
      blue ones too soft        

159
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,513
   to have at least a 12-day    
   refrigerated shelf life.     

160
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,651
      air jets blow those       
 soft berries off the conveyor  

161
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,988
   so they can be transferred   
   to the frozen-berry line.    

162
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,193
      the rest continue to      
  a final visual inspection.    

163
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,396
       the fresh berries        
   are ready for packaging.     

164
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,265
 this electronic fill machine   

165
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,268
     is preset to weigh out     
     the specific quantity      

166
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,602
      they're packaging,        

167
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,206
         in this case,          
  nearly 2-pound containers.    

168
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:11,543
     it drops that quantity     
          of berries            

169
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,979
        into an awaiting        
      plastic container.        

170
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,351
       the final stop on        
      the packaging line        

171
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,889
   is the flat-seal machine.    

172
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,757
           it applies           
    a printed plastic film      

173
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,225
 to the top of the container,   

174
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,694
     melting and bonding it     
       to the perimeter         

175
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,964
   without a touch of heat.     

176
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,502
the film has ventilation holes  

177
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:40,305
     because fresh berries      
         require air.           

178
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,506
   from here, the containers    

179
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,775
           go off to            
   a refrigerated warehouse     

180
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:48,113
 to await shipping to the store 
    by refrigerated truck.      

181
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,449
    and provided they remain    
         refrigerated,          

182
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,517
     the blueberries remain     
        fresh and juicy         

183
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,720
      for 10 to 12 days.        

184
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,735
           narrator:            
  there's a new john in town.   

185
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,804
     composting toilets are     
      the greatest thing        

186
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,806
    since indoor plumbing.      

187
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,875
    in fact, they don't need    
     any plumbing at all.       

188
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,678
      so they can go where      
  traditional toilets do not.   

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,747
     they are little waste      
      treatment machines.       

190
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,482
           they turn            
    the unpleasant business     

191
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,951
    of sewage into something    
       more agreeable --        

192
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,753
      garden fertilizer.        

193
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,558
 this composting toilet works   

194
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,093
  a bit of magic with sewage.   

195
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,829
    it transforms the solids    
         into compost           

196
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,899
      and makes the liquids     
           disappear.           

197
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,503
  making these toilets starts   
    with a composting tank.     

198
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:48,707
   a worker sprays fiberglass   
   into a mold of the tank.     

199
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,843
   then he and another member   
   of the team press out air    

200
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,913
 trapped between the fiberglass 
       and mold surface.        

201
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,649
     once the part cures,       

202
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,719
     a blast of compressed      
 air loosens it from the mold.  

203
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,789
     and he lifts it out.       

204
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,857
       it's a bit ragged        
        around the rim.         

205
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,826
   so they do a basic trim.     

206
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,633
  he drills holes in the tank   
   for installing fittings.     

207
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,338
       using a pneumatic        
        circular blade,         

208
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,941
        he slices a hole        
    for the compost drawer.     

209
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,245
     and he grinds the rim      
   to precise measurements.     

210
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,883
     he screws two overflow     
            fittings            

211
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,586
      into a threaded hole      
   on the back of the tank.     

212
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,690
   he seals the fittings with   
             epoxy              

213
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,626
      from the other side       
       of the tank wall.        

214
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,496
      this epoxy seal will      
        prevent leaks.          

215
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,367
     moving down the line,      

216
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,503
another worker sprays adhesive  

217
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:55,173
         on the bottom          
    of the composting tank.     

218
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,909
           he presses           
   an aluminum panel to it.     

219
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,577
 this panel will radiate heat   

220
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,181
     from a heating element     
     he installs over it.       

221
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,050
          it will heat          
    the evaporation chamber     

222
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,120
          in the tank           
     to dissipate liquids.      

223
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,656
      he places fiberglass      
           insulation           
        over the heater         

224
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:15,393
      and encases it with       
  a molded fiberglass cover.    

225
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,129
      he wires the heater       
   and installs a thermostat    

226
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,598
  that will regulate the heat   

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,466
 and also shut off the system   

228
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,103
 if the temperature drops below 
   or exceeds the threshold.    

229
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,943
    he turns the composting     
   toilet tank right-side-up    

230
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,812
  to await further assembly.    

231
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,884
   meanwhile, another worker    
       assembles the fan        

232
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:42,254
 for exhausting the evaporated  
     fluids and any odors.      

233
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,692
   he inserts the motor shaft   
   in a hole in the fan door    

234
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,961
 so that it protrudes inside.   

235
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:55,100
    he then screws the motor    
  to the outside of the door.   

236
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,636
       next, he assembles       
    the centrifugal blower      

237
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:59,738
      to the motor shaft.       

238
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,243
          he installs           
       a plastic shroud.        

239
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,577
     it surrounds the fan,      

240
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,047
     protecting the blades'     
     interacting airflow.       

241
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,522
     at the next station,       

242
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,191
  a worker prepares the drum    

243
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,060
      in which solid waste      
 will be converted to compost   

244
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,997
   by aerobic decomposition.    

245
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,999
     he fastens a stainless     
         steel screen           

246
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,035
  to an opening in the drum.    

247
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,207
    liquid waste will drain     
      through this screen       

248
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:39,344
            and into            
   the evaporation chamber.     

249
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,147
        once evaporated,        
     the fan will expel it      

250
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,349
    through the vent stack.     

251
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:52,157
     he now places the drum     
      in the tank, bearings     
           elevated,            

252
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,961
     so it sits just above      
   the evaporation chamber.     

253
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,631
     he fits a plastic top      
          to the tank           

254
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,100
       and screws the two       
     components together.       

255
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,105
       he inserts a metal       
       shaft with gears,        

256
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,476
   engaging them with grooves   
  on the outside of the drum.   

257
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,847
       he inserts the fan       
        into an opening         

258
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,917
  at the back and secures it.   

259
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,788
        he wires the fan        
     to the power source.       

260
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,457
      he installs a cover       
    to protect the wiring.      

261
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,127
   and he connects the shaft    
   to a handle at the front.    

262
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,796
      it rotates the drum       
      to mix the contents       

263
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,197
       and introduce air        

264
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,468
      so that the aerobic       
  microorganisms will thrive.   

265
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,539
        after electrical        
       and other tests,         

266
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,409
  a worker installs the drawer  
   for the finished compost.    

267
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,143
   she fastens the seat to the  
              base              

268
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,047
        with nylon nuts         
     and bolts with caps.       

269
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,019
  she inserts a plastic liner   
         in the bowl.           

270
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:57,555
       and this completes       
    the composting toilet.      

271
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,225
     by turning human waste     
         into compost,          

272
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,962
 things will eventually end up  
     smelling like roses.       

273
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,846
  narrator: electrical systems  
               are              
 vulnerable to voltage spikes   

274
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:24,448
         from lightning         
     or switching surges.       

275
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,917
   surge arresters take over    

276
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,787
     in these high-voltage      
          situations.           

277
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,824
    when lightning strikes,     

278
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,594
        surge arresters         
      handle the fallout.       

279
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,664
    they divert the ensuing     
  power surges to the earth,    

280
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,467
where they won't cause damage.  

281
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,337
    at their core are discs     
     that act as switches.      

282
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,342
      they turn on and off      
   to divert voltage spikes.    

283
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,544
     the discs are known as     
            m.o.v.s,            

284
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:56,948
         which is short         
  for metal oxide varistors.    

285
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,685
   a worker loops fiberglass    
     strapping onto aluminum    
            endcaps             

286
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,221
     to prepare the casing      
       for the m.o.v.s.         

287
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,225
   he places a spacer on one    
     end of the end caps.       

288
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,095
     he then packs numerous     
        m.o.v.s on top,         

289
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,031
    equipping this arrester     
           to divert            

290
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,368
  a 60,000-volt power surge.    

291
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,105
      he adds more spacers      
      to fill in any gaps       

292
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,706
   because the m.o.v. stack     

293
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,042
        has to sit tight        
      within the casing.        

294
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,379
   with the stack complete,     

295
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,514
    he loops more fiberglass    
       strapping around         

296
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,386
    the m.o.v.s to complete     
          the casing.           

297
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,722
    he torques the set screw    
    to compress the stack.      

298
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,992
   the set screw also pushes    
      back the end caps.        

299
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:45,997
   this pulls the fiberglass    
      strapping tighter.        

300
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,133
         he now clamps          
      the surge arrester        

301
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,468
assembly between two mandrels.  

302
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,141
   he ties a resin-reinforced   
            thread              

303
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,543
     around the fiberglass      
       loop at one end.         

304
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,420
       he lowers a guard        
    as a safety precaution.     

305
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,624
     the mandrels then spin     
   the surge arrester module    

306
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,892
    as a computer-programmed    
           dispenser            

307
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,696
        winds the thread        
  around it to strengthen it.   

308
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,499
        it creates gaps         
     between the windings.      

309
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,634
   this will allow sparks and   
             fumes              

310
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:27,105
     to escape in the event     
     of a power overload.       

311
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,907
  with the winding complete,    

312
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,111
  he cuts the end and tucks it  
    under the last winding.     

313
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,379
      he hangs the module       
      on a rack conveyer,       

314
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,382
which takes it into a chamber.  

315
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,786
      here, a tank filled       

316
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,589
   with an adhesive-promoting   
       solution rises up        

317
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,858
   and immerses the module.     

318
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,327
     this leaves a coating      
that will help silicone rubber  

319
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,696
          housing bond          
     to the module later.       

320
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,066
   he removes the hook used     

321
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,201
       to hang the module       
     on the rack conveyer       

322
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,138
     and installs mandrels      
    at both ends to be used     

323
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,141
       at a later stage of      
          processing.           

324
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,676
  he sets the module between    

325
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:06,945
          the rungs of          
   a chain-driven conveyer.     

326
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:14,085
  it takes it through an oven   
set at 302 degrees fahrenheit.  

327
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,287
      this cures the resin      
        in the thread,          

328
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,291
      causing it to harden      
      around the fiberglass     
           strapping.           

329
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,960
   it also preheats the surge   
        arrester module         

330
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,697
         in preparation         
    for the next process --     

331
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:29,433
         the molding of         
      the outer housing.        

332
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,969
      using the mandrels,       

333
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:34,105
   he locks two of the surge    
arrester modules in a platform  

334
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,441
      and slides it under       
         a mold press.          

335
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,712
 a lift takes it to the press.  

336
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,383
   it injects silicone rubber   
        into the mold.          

337
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,184
 and using pressure and heat,   

338
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,853
  it forms insulating jackets   

339
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,923
 around the arrester modules.   

340
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,526
       the primer coating       
     enhances the adhesion      

341
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,660
     of the silicone rubber     
        to the modules.         

342
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,798
     he clips off unwanted      
    bits of silicone rubber     

343
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,266
    from the molded housing     

344
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,802
     and cleans up the ends     
      with a wire brush.        

345
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,007
      surge arresters come      
 in a range of voltage ratings  

346
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,343
         for different          
      electrical systems.       

347
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:16,948
 he now lubricates the threaded 
    bolt holes in one end.      

348
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,817
     he aligns those holes      

349
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,887
         with the ones          
   on a terminal connector.     

350
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,957
     he bolts the connector     
    to the surge arrester.      

351
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,631
       he installs a base       
       on the other end.        

352
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,500
      this base will allow      
         the arrester           

353
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,368
  to be mounted to the ground   

354
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,271
    to send excess voltages     
         to the earth.          

355
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,919
     he now puts the surge      
     arrester to the test.      

356
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,188
     he connects electrodes     
   to the terminal connector    

357
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,457
       and to the base.         

358
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,459
   he runs different voltages   
        of electricity          

359
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,596
      through the arrester      
         and confirms           

360
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:08,333
       that it adequately       
       discharges them.         

361
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:12,069
   this surge arrester is now   
              ready             
  to join others on the grid,   

362
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,205
       forming a defense        
   against lightning strikes    

363
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,840
       and power spikes.
