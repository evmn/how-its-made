captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,321
narrator: carbon fiber is an engineer's dream --   

4
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,191
lightweight yet incredibly strong.     

5
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,728
it's a string with thousands of parallel filaments.     

6
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,631
multiple strings can be twisted into yarns,   

7
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,668
woven into fabrics, or molded with resin      

8
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,338
to produce materials called carbon-fiber composites.

9
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:17,676
carbon fiber is five times stronger than steel      

10
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,345
yet less than half the weight. 

11
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,548
to make it, they take a plastic fiber   

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,683
composed of thousands of filaments          

13
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,618
far thinner than human hair.  

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,554
they then chemically alter it 

15
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,223
to form a perfect chain of carbon atoms        

16
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,892
for the final product.     

17
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:36,696
this mammoth machine lines up dozens of those fibers     

18
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:39,098
which then travel through an oxidation oven   

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
for a couple of minutes.    

20
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,636
the oven temperature, about 480 degrees fahrenheit, 

21
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:48,774
prompts the fibers to pick up oxygen molecules from the air. 

22
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,577
this rearranges the fibers' atomic structure, 

23
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,880
rendering them resistant to high heat.         

24
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,517
as the fibers oxidize,     

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,921
they change color to eventually turn black.   

26
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:06,058
they're now primed for the next
process, carbonization.    

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,196
furnaces heat the fibers in an oxygen-free gas mixture. 

28
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,331
this expels the non-carbon atoms

29
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,067
and transforms the remaining carbon atoms   

30
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,137
into tightly bonded crystals  

31
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,206
running parallel to the length of the fiber.  

32
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,875
this gives the fiber its strength.         

33
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,478
the exiting fibers travel   

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,147
through a bath of electrically charged water 

35
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:33,352
that etches the fibers' surface
so they'll better absorb resin.

36
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,555
the next station applies a light
preliminary coat of resin.   

37
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,692
this will strengthen the fibers' chemical bond   

38
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,894
to the molding resin.     

39
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,563
a spooling machine winds each fiber,        

40
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,232
now referred to as a carbon-fiber tow,     

41
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,567
onto a bobbin         

42
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,238
which buyers either weave into a carbon-fiber fabric   

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,307
or mix with resin to mold a product.       

44
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,443
another form of carbon fiber is prepreg --         

45
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,982
sheets of resin-impregnated carbon fiber ready for molding.

46
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:06,051
it's like ready-to-bake cake mix.           

47
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,720
the resin is a formula of epoxy

48
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:13,459
and various powdered hardeners and accelerators.       

49
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,529
workers pour the resin into a filming machine     

50
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:20,866
which spreads it        
in a thin, wet layer onto paper.

51
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,938
the paper is pre-treated with a release agent      

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,407
to prevent the final product from sticking,         

53
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,280
like spraying a baking pan with non-stick coating.    

54
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,947
another machine, meanwhile,  

55
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,817
groups 200 to 300 carbon-fiber tows       

56
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,221
into a giant band of fibers called a web.         

57
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,563
the width and thickness of the web           

58
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,568
determines the width and thickness of the prepreg sheet.

59
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,371
workers mount two rolls of resin-coated paper     

60
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,974
onto the resin-impregnation machine.            

61
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,377
a heating element warms up the web as it enters 

62
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,880
to facilitate resin absorption.

63
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,584
then the heated carbon-fiber web

64
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:17,189
is sandwiched between two sheets
of resin-coated paper.     

65
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,325
high-pressure heated rollers thin out the resin       

66
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,796
so it penetrates the millions of carbon-fiber filaments.   

67
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,268
cooling plates then turn the liquid resin to gel     

68
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,737
so that the next station can remove the paper,     

69
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,774
which pulls off easily thanks to the release agent.  

70
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,080
the next station covers the top
of the prepreg sheet      

71
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,217
with polyester film.      

72
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,354
this prevents the prepreg sheet

73
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,224
from sticking to itself at the end of the line     

74
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,961
when it's wound into a roll like a fruit roll-up.     

75
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,834
in the factory's lab,     

76
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:07,573
technicians run quality control
tests on prepreg samples.   

77
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,241
first they weigh the sample.  

78
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,044
then they wash off the resin with chemicals         

79
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,712
and weigh the sample again.  

80
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,449
this verifies whether the ratio
of carbon fiber to resin    

81
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,584
is correct.          

82
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,787
the lab also analyzes samples of composite --    

83
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,123
carbon-fiber reinforced resin --

84
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,525
in this tensile strength test. 

85
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,928
the computer measures how much strain the sample withstands  

86
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,031
before breaking.        

87
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,536
such testing ensures the carbon fiber        

88
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:42,741
delivers optimum strength,   
durability, and heat resistance,

89
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,077
whether it's used to make an auto part,     

90
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,881
a wind-turbine blade, or a golf club.        

91
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,033
narrator: antique gilded frames
have spent many years     

92
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,902
protecting paintings and enhancing them.       

93
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:13,972
but over time, grime can obscure
the gold-leaf shine      

94
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,109
and the frame can suffer damage
and deterioration.       

95
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,979
but these frames are highly collectible,    

96
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:23,148
and restoring them preserves their value.     

97
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,386
with elaborate cast ornamentation       

98
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,653
and gold-leaf work,      

99
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:34,259
this 19th-century gilded frame is itself a work of art.    

100
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,729
but it's in need of renewal.  

101
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:40,065
restoration work        
done many years ago has cracked,

102
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,402
and gold leaf is deteriorating elsewhere on the frame.    

103
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,203
the technician carefully    

104
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,873
pries the cracked acorn casting
loose             

105
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,075
and removes it from the frame. 

106
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,744
he'll make a new one from scratch.         

107
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,748
it will need to completely fill
the empty space        

108
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,884
and look exactly like the others
on the frame.         

109
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,225
he starts by making a mold with dental impression rubber. 

110
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:09,294
he kneads the two putty-like components together      

111
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,031
to activate the ingredients.  

112
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:15,167
when the color's uniform and there are no streaks,   

113
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,836
the rubber is ready for molding.

114
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,638
he must act quickly      

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,241
because in just three minutes the rubber will cure.     

116
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,245
he presses it around the acorn ornament on the frame

117
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,515
to capture the detail.     

118
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,318
he now has a mold he can use  

119
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,589
to cast a new ornament for the frame.         

120
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,126
he'll use this wood epoxy for that.           

121
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,328
like the dental impression rubber,            

122
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,131
it must be mixed thoroughly to activate it.        

123
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,668
he presses the epoxy into the contours of the mold, 

124
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,803
pushing it from one end to the other.         

125
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,807
this will prevent air from becoming trapped in the casting

126
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,942
and compromising its integrity.

127
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:01,747
after a 10-minute cure, the epoxy casting is ready,  

128
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:06,151
and he extracts it from the mold.         

129
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,886
he examines the detail     

130
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,490
and confirms that it is an exact reproduction.     

131
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,960
then, using a scoop chisel,  

132
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:18,430
he sculpts the edges and the inside of the casting 

133
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,900
to shape it to the picture frame.     

134
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,836
in this comparison shot,    

135
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:27,172
the shaped part is the one on the left.    

136
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,110
he places the cast epoxy ornament on the frame     

137
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:34,446
and nails it down.       

138
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,515
the epoxy is still soft enough 

139
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:41,319
that he can drive the nail into it without breaking it.  

140
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,856
he fills the gap between the casting and the frame   

141
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,390
with more epoxy,        

142
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:50,329
providing a seamless transition
from new to old.        

143
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,464
after the epoxy solidifies,  

144
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,933
he brushes something called bole
onto it.            

145
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,937
bole is a mix of clay and rabbit-skin glue.     

146
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,141
it provides a surface that the gold can adhere to,  

147
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:04,676
and the rabbit-skin glue will give it flex       

148
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,945
as the wood expands and contracts.         

149
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:13,852
he then transfers the 23-karat gold leaf to the casting.   

150
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,156
before he lays each piece of gold leaf,         

151
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,359
he wets the surface of the ornament        

152
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,026
with a gilder's liqueur --   

153
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,764
a mix of water, alcohol, and rabbit-skin glue.     

154
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,766
this causes the gold leaf   

155
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:32,237
to conform to the contours of the ornament and adhere.  

156
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,839
after the golf leaf sets for an hour or two,      

157
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,375
he burnishes it to a very high shine      

158
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:42,114
using a tool made from agate, 
a very hard, semiprecious stone.

159
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,781
hundreds of years ago,     

160
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,019
craftsman used dogs' teeth for this job.         

161
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,723
he rubs the shiny, new gold surface          

162
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,259
with very fine-grade steel wool.

163
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,996
this removes some of the gold to simulate natural wear    

164
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:02,634
so that it matches the patina of the rest of the frame.   

165
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,004
and what a transformation   

166
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,741
this plain epoxy casting has undergone.         

167
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,277
newly gilded, and it looks like

168
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,547
it's always been part of the antique frame.     

169
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:22,154
other sections of the frame require regilding.       

170
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,356
he rubs alcohol onto those areas

171
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,025
to get rid of atmospheric residue     

172
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,629
that would prevent the adhesion
of the new gold.        

173
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,900
and after applying gilder's liqueur,        

174
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:38,704
he lays sheets of the new gold leaf over the old,

175
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:43,508
working with a steady rhythm to 
give the area complete coverage.

176
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,511
he's aiming for more of a matte finish on this section,

177
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,914
so he doesn't polish it.    

178
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,184
he brushes a protective coat of shellac onto it.      

179
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,921
he's used a combination of old materials and new    

180
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,925
to restore this antique gilt frame,    

181
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:03,328
and it's picture-perfect.   

182
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,810
narrator: pushing and pulling railcars at the train yard   

183
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,612
is the job of a large motorized vehicle       

184
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,615
appropriately called a railcar mover.        

185
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,818
it switches the cars from one track to another,   

186
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,755
shuttles them in and out of the cargo loading area,   

187
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:34,059
and positions them in line behind the locomotive.     

188
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,232
a railcar mover has to drive  
both on and off the train track,

189
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,568
so it has two types of wheels --

190
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,238
four steel rail wheels for guiding it on the track  

191
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,241
and four wheels with rubber tires       

192
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,311
for driving on the ground.   

193
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:58,316
when building a railcar mover, they start with the frame.   

194
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,618
a computer-guided plasma cutter

195
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,457
cuts out all the frame parts  
from a 4-inch-thick steel plate.

196
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,927
once all the frame parts are ready,           

197
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,596
workers begin welding them together.           

198
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:16,001
they position the deck plate, the mover's floor, upside down 

199
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,003
and weld on the frame rails.  

200
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:22,074
these will hold the axles for the rubber wheels.     

201
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:26,744
then, to those frame rails, they weld the rail arm mounts. 

202
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:31,483
these will hold the rail arms which hold the rail wheels.  

203
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:36,087
after welding several additional
components to the frame,    

204
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,156
workers bolt the axles for the rubber wheels      

205
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,459
to the frame rails...     

206
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,333
...then the rail arms to the rail mounts.      

207
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:53,372
now the frame goes to the paint shop        

208
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:57,042
for a coat of primer followed by a coat of automotive paint. 

209
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,111
workers also roll on a textured floor coating    

210
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,913
to create a non-slip surface  

211
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,385
for the driver to safely walk to and from the cab.      

212
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:12,257
when the paint dries, the frame
returns to the assembly line  

213
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,658
where workers begin mounting  

214
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,997
the 4.5-foot-wide rail wheels onto the rail arms.      

215
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,399
after mounting each wheel on the spindle,        

216
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,936
they install a bearing, then a large nut.       

217
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,605
they must tighten the nut to the correct torque     

218
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:32,978
yet not over-tighten it, or the wheel won't turn freely.

219
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,483
once they've got just the correct torque,    

220
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,953
they secure the nut with a retaining lock nut.   

221
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,688
they finish off this installation       

222
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,092
with the rail-wheel equivalent of a hubcap.          

223
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,494
this steel cover holds in the grease      

224
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,496
that lubricates the wheel and bearing          

225
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,231
while keeping out dust and dirt.

226
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,837
next they mount the four rubber wheels,    

227
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,274
securing each one with a dozen bolts.      

228
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,980
these steel wheels with rubber tires        

229
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:13,318
are about 6 1/2 feet in diameter.          

230
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,653
workers mount several other components,   

231
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,323
including a pair of air tanks with gauges          

232
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,793
for the railcar's pneumatic brake system.    

233
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,795
these are the brakes the driver uses        

234
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,865
when the mover is coupled to railcars.    

235
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,332
when it's not,         

236
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,203
the mover has its own separate hydraulic brake system,    

237
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:37,175
the components of which workers
also install at this stage.  

238
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,549
they attach a hydraulic cylinder
to the steer axle.       

239
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,018
this controls the steering of the rubber wheels      

240
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,422
when the mover is off the train track.    

241
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:54,358
the rail wheels, of course, don't require any steering,  

242
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,896
as they simply follow the track.

243
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:02,700
now workers install the 300-horsepower diesel engine. 

244
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,037
it's already bolted to the transmission.      

245
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,242
then they hook up the electrical wiring,     

246
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,310
which connects the engine and transmission        

247
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,446
to the computer controlling them.       

248
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,985
they lower the hood over the engine and transmission.  

249
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,855
the hood has three components already installed --      

250
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,926
the engine air intake, air cleaner, and muffler.   

251
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,730
finally, they install the cab. 

252
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,466
it has a steering wheel for driving off-rail      

253
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,936
and a control console that rotates 180 degrees    

254
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,072
to let the driver operate at whichever side of the cab  

255
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,406
provides the best view     

256
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,178
of all the railcars      
the mover is pulling or pushing.

257
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,082
the finished railcar mover doesn't leave the factory    

258
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,952
before a burn-in period in the test pit.        

259
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,888
the test is so intense,    

260
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,758
the rubber tires have to be cooled with water. 

261
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,695
pulling as many as 40 railcars at a time           

262
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,031
is no job for a lightweight.  

263
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:11,403
that's why a railcar mover weighs in at up to 45 tons.  

264
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,253
narrator: at first, hood ornaments were used    

265
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,857
to beautify external temperature
gauges and radiator caps.   

266
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,460
they then evolved into signature pieces     

267
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,796
that embodied the car brand.  

268
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,731
and when the radiator caps were moved under the hood,   

269
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,502
the ornaments stayed on top.  

270
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,942
a hood ornament is a little piece of automotive art.    

271
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,478
popular mainly on luxury cars now,      

272
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,681
these ornaments symbolize the spirit of the car     

273
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,318
and can make quite a statement on the street.         

274
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,221
each ornament starts      

275
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,490
with an aluminum mold that consists of many parts  

276
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,827
in order to achieve a complex shape.        

277
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,630
an injector pumps specially formulated wax    

278
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,567
into the mold cavity.     

279
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,171
the wax solidifies quickly.  

280
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:25,644
the operator dismantles the mold
and removes the cast wax model. 

281
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:30,715
the detail is impressive.   

282
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,584
he examines it for flaws.   

283
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:38,789
he cools the model in water until the wax firms.      

284
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,058
this wax model will be used to make a mold  

285
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,261
to cast the metal ornament   

286
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:48,199
using a technique that dates back thousands of years. 

287
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,936
he attaches numerous cast models
to a wax riser         

288
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,973
by melting the wax a little so they adhere.        

289
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,612
the next worker then dips the models and riser      

290
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:05,016
into specially formulated ceramic slurry.        

291
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:10,288
he makes sure that the liquid covers every detail.      

292
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,427
still wet, the models then go into the rain sander, 

293
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,565
so named because it actually rains grit.    

294
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,636
the grit sticks to the models for a stucco effect.      

295
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:28,707
he repeats the ceramic dip and grit process three times  

296
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:33,311
to build up substantial shells around the wax models.     

297
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:38,450
these shells will serve as molds
to cast the hood ornament.   

298
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,187
in this case, the casting material is steel. 

299
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,323
they melt rejected       
hood ornaments with steel chunks

300
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:49,661
to transform them into a white-hot liquid.    

301
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,865
the ceramic models have by now been cured     

302
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,601
and the wax melted out.    

303
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:03,941
workers ladle the molten steel into the riser feeder cup.   

304
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,678
the steel flows into all of the ceramic molds. 

305
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,749
they top it off with a manganese mixture    

306
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,349
that catches fire       

307
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:16,688
and keeps the steel hot and liquid a little longer,  

308
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,624
ensuring that it feeds into all of the molds.     

309
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,762
the steel cools for several hours and solidifies. 

310
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,832
an employee then breaks open the network of molds      

311
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,302
to reveal the cast hood ornaments.    

312
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,372
he inserts a pneumatic hammer into the feeder cup,      

313
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:38,909
and it shakes off most     
of the remaining ceramic shards.

314
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,912
this machine blasts off the rest

315
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:45,116
using very fine stainless-steel particles.   

316
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,251
they're ready to cut the cast ornaments       

317
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,787
free from the main base.    

318
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,723
with the riser on its side,  

319
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:55,393
the worker slices off one hood ornament at a time  

320
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,863
using an aluminum-oxide cutting wheel.         

321
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,933
at this angle, he can't make a clean cut.   

322
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:06,337
he leaves a fairly thick chunk on the base.          

323
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:11,008
he grinds off that chunk using an abrasive belt.     

324
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,279
the base of the hood ornament is now smooth and level.    

325
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:19,484
next he refines the shape of the hood ornament.     

326
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,821
he grinds away excess material 

327
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,089
to improve the profile of the piece          

328
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,959
and generally clean it up.   

329
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:34,532
this process also adds shine to the stainless steel.    

330
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,238
to give the hood ornaments a real polish,         

331
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,577
they plunge them into a sulfuric-acid solution. 

332
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:49,647
the solution eats away     
impurities to expose the nickel.

333
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,584
a worker buffs each hood ornament       

334
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,588
against a cloth wheel until it gleams.        

335
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,126
he examines his work under a magnifying glass.   

336
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,595
defects won't be tolerated,  

337
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:07,332
and even at this stage, the statuette could be rejected

338
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,534
and melted into a new one.   

339
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,403
it passes inspection.     

340
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:19,144
made of steel, silver, or gold,
a hood ornament on a luxury car

341
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,781
is a great way to say you've arrived.     

342
