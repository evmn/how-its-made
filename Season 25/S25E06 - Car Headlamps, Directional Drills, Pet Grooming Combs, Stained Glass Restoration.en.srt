00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,055
narrator: headlights aren't just functional.         

4
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,789
they're often the first design feature     

5
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,126
that catches the eye of a potential buyer.      

6
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,929
unlike the metal and glass versions of the past,              

7
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,332
today's headlights are made of durable plastics   

8
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:10,036
that can be creatively molded into a multitude of shapes.   

9
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,677
in addition to the main beam, this pickup truck headlight has               

10
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,214
an integrated amber turn signal and daytime running light.    

11
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,088
most of the headlight's components            

12
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,958
are made of injection-molded plastic.   

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,562
the machine melts plastic pellets into a gooey liquid,   

14
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,099
then shoots it into a mold for the specific part.      

15
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,436
the headlight lenses are made of clear polycarbonate,     

16
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,770
a strong plastic         

17
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,641
that's resistant to extreme heat and cold.    

18
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,711
the molding process stresses the plastic.      

19
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,179
to relieve that stress,     

20
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,381
they put the lens into an annealing oven      

21
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:57,783
for 20 minutes.         

22
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,185
when the lens comes out,     

23
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:02,054
they wipe it down with an anti-static cloth    

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,857
and inspect the surface meticulously.          

25
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,261
next, a robot sprays the lens with a protective coating.    

26
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,097
this will prevent scratches,   

27
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,867
chips, or yellowing from exposure to ultraviolet rays.  

28
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,307
they run the lens through a tunnel oven to cure it.    

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,282
this component is the reflector           
for the headlight's main beam.  

30
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:34,754
it's made of fiberglass-reinforced polyester.           

31
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,623
they sand away any excess material,       

32
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,026
then hand wash the part with soap and water       

33
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:43,396
to remove any polyester residue left by the sanding.       

34
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,636
then, they put the reflector into a machine          

35
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:54,172
similar to a dishwasher.     

36
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,577
a robot sprays on a coat of primer.       

37
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,911
it goes on clear,        

38
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,748
but turns yellow after it cures in an oven.    

39
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:11,257
now comes the process that makes the reflector reflective.    

40
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,395
inside an aluminizing chamber,  

41
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,196
a fixture rotates the reflector            

42
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,867
on its own axis as well as around copper electrodes   

43
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,602
at the center of the machine.  

44
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,874
an electrical charge to the copper electrodes     

45
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,010
generates heat, which vaporizes an aluminum wire              

46
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,847
that's wrapped around a spiral tungsten filament.        

47
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,884
the aluminum becomes a mist   

48
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,421
that deposits evenly across the surface of the reflector.  

49
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,430
now they assemble the headlight,           

50
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,831
beginning with the housing.   

51
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,735
it's made of injected-molded polypropylene.          

52
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,106
after installing the reflector 
for the daytime running light,  

53
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,509
they attach the main beam reflector.            

54
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,578
they include pivots and adjusting screws       

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,280
so that the beam level can be customized.        

56
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,252
they screw in the reflector for the turn signal.       

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,655
it's made of aluminized plastic.            

58
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,329
then, a robot applies a sealant which prevents water, dust,   

59
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,831
and insects from penetrating the housing.  

60
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,804
they place the assembly in a lens binding machine.    

61
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,875
then, they insert the main beam lens,              

62
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,144
which has already been joined  

63
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:42,414
to the turn signal and daytime running lights.   

64
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,284
the top of the binding machine descends,            

65
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,554
securing these assemblies to each other with screws.    

66
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,892
next, they screw in a halogen bulb   

67
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,362
for the main beam reflector.   

68
00:04:56,364 --> 00:05:02,368
the bulb has two filaments for a high and low beam.     

69
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,836
then, they add halogen bulbs for the turn signal       

70
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,174
and daytime running lights.   

71
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,977
the last step is to level the main beam reflector.     

72
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,914
this leveling machine tells them which adjustable screws     

73
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:19,451
to turn to tilt the reflector into the correct position.    

74
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,121
this is the manufacturer's default setting.         

75
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:25,057
auto makers can change this before installing the headlights           

76
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,492
in their vehicles.        

77
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,400
this model hooks up to wiring coming from the pickup truck.  

78
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:36,068
some headlights have built-in wiring       

79
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,937
that connects to the vehicle.  

80
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,076
it's easy to change a burnt out bulb in both designs.    

81
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,878
you simply lift the hood of the vehicle          

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,648
to access the bulb from the rear of the headlight housing.    

83
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,099
narrator: when work crews need to lay pipes or cables,   

84
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,701
they use a directional drill   

85
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,503
to bore a horizontal hole underground.           

86
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,772
it enters the ground at an angle,           

87
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,840
drills underneath the surface horizontally,          

88
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,577
then exits at an angle on the other end.        

89
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,052
a directional drill enters the ground at an 18 degree angle.  

90
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,422
once it reaches the desired   
depth, it drills horizontally.  

91
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:34,326
the machine can attach several onboard drill rods    

92
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,663
for increased drilling distance.            

93
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:40,432
most of the machine's parts are made of steel,        

94
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,769
cut to the required shape by a computer-guided laser.   

95
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,311
workers use a press brake to bend certain parts.      

96
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,416
this is part of the drill's undercarriage,  

97
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,185
the frame            
on which everything else sits.  

98
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,623
after they bend this part,    

99
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,526
they weld it to other parts to build the engine mount.    

100
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:20,372
they weld the engine mount to  
the rest of the undercarriage.  

101
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,374
once the undercarriage is complete,           

102
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,109
they clean the steel with a chemical         

103
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,045
to maximize the adhesion    
of the industrial-grade primer  

104
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,714
and paint.            

105
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,185
once the paint dries,      

106
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,655
they install a rubber track on each side.          

107
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,123
tires leave ruts in the ground,             

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,325
so tracks work better.      

109
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,262
the track loops around a rail and sprocket at the back.    

110
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:48,133
workers mount the sprocket on  
a hydraulically-powered motor,  

111
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,936
then align the sprocket teeth with the track.         

112
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,338
when the motor runs,       

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,808
the sprocket rotates, driving the track.        

114
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,410
they apply thread-locking fluid              

115
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,346
to the bolts that secure the sprocket to the motor.    

116
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,183
this ensures the sprocket won't loosen.          

117
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,955
then, they install a track tensioning spring    

118
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,191
and tighten it with a pneumatic wrench.     

119
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,896
next, the steel hydraulic tank.              

120
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,164
it holds the hydraulic oil    

121
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:24,703
for the machine's 23      
different hydraulic functions.  

122
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,304
now the water pump.       

123
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,240
it lubricates the drill rod   

124
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,642
with water to help it move through the ground.   

125
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:34,079
it also cleans the machine after each drilling job.     

126
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,983
they install the pivot mechanism            

127
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,619
that opens and closes the engine hood.         

128
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,990
now that the hydraulic tank,   

129
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,127
water pump, and hood pivot are in place,   

130
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:52,865
they begin installing the machine's diesel engine.   

131
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,402
it's similar to a tractor engine.       

132
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,204
they connect its wiring to the operator console     

133
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,542
and several other components on the machine.         

134
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,678
the operator console consists of the driver seat,   

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,682
dashboard lcd display, and joystick controls.      

136
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,555
next, they join the rack     

137
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,892
containing all the drilling components to the undercarriage.         

138
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,098
they install two plastic tanks --       

139
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,767
white for water, black for fuel.              

140
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,040
then, the onboard computer that runs the engine       

141
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,843
and drilling components.     

142
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,647
they also install control valves for the hydraulic lines.     

143
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,786
they mount the rod box,     

144
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,588
which holds 40 drill rods,    

145
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,590
each measuring 2 inches in diameter           

146
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,993
by 10 feet in length.      

147
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,363
larger models have longer and wider drill rods.   

148
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,136
they connect the ventilated   
plastic hood to the hood pivot  

149
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,604
they installed earlier.     

150
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,610
they close the hood over the engine,         

151
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:17,082
then apply make and model number decals.     

152
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,751
this directional drilling machine is now fully built    

153
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,821
and ready for testing.      

154
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,157
as the rack tilts down at the front,          

155
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,160
hydraulically-powered outrigger feet at the back descend,    

156
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,297
raising the machine into the drill position.     

157
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,635
giant augurs at the front keep the machine on the ground.             

158
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:40,238
the rack's gearbox is powered by a hydraulic motor.             

159
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,773
it rotates the drill rod     

160
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,376
while the carriage moves the rod through the ground.       

161
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,514
when the job's done, the carriage moves back,     

162
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,016
retracting the rod.       

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,453
with all its rods joined together,         

164
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:59,057
this small machine can drill almost 400 feet.    

165
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,473
narrator: pet grooming combs   

166
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,344
are specifically designed for animal fur.         

167
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,679
they can get down to the roots  

168
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:25,017
to detangle, loosen, and remove dead hair.      

169
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,151
a good grooming comb       

170
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,554
is essential to the primping process.     

171
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,895
it's believed that the pets   
of british and french nobility  

172
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,299
were the first to be regularly groomed centuries ago.      

173
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:46,738
today, a lot of pets receive the royal treatment.   

174
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,509
at this factory,         

175
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,647
pet combs start with bundles of long brass bars.       

176
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,851
a computer-guided saw slices them into 6-inch pieces.     

177
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:07,859
each piece will be transformed into a comb body.        

178
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,275
an employee inserts six of the brass pieces into a vice              

179
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,177
and tightens the clamps.     

180
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,614
a computerized drill       

181
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,151
carves dimples into the ends of each of the blanks.      

182
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,354
this is called a predrill.    

183
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,758
the drill returns to each dimple,         

184
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,761
producing precisely-cut holes to join the comb body      

185
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,429
to a handle.           

186
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,570
next, a computerized drill bores into the brass pieces,   

187
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,506
creating small holes for the comb's teeth.      

188
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,844
the spacing of the holes varies             

189
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,981
depending on the type of comb being made.       

190
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:07,719
combs with tightly-spaced teeth are used for finer fur.     

191
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,656
the combs are now ready for teeth.            

192
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:15,126
an employee inserts three comb bodies in a fixture,            

193
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,996
then grabs a handful of steel pins          

194
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,733
and pops them into the holes, one by one.           

195
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:26,471
these steel teeth aren't sharp.             

196
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,473
they've been blunted to avoid hurting the animal   

197
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,208
during combing.         

198
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,013
she gently taps the steel teeth              

199
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,216
with a hammer to force them further into the holes.   

200
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,221
she brushes off any residual shavings      

201
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,756
from the earlier drilling.    

202
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,429
then, she places the combs on a demagnetizer.        

203
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,499
it erases any magnetic fields in the steel teeth        

204
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,768
that could compromise the chrome plating finish    

205
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,537
they will soon receive.     

206
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,414
next, a punch sets the steel  
teeth in their final position.  

207
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,655
at another station,       

208
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,858
a device cuts extruded aluminum into shorter pieces.       

209
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:27,532
these pieces of aluminum will be the pet comb handles.  

210
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,802
their contoured shape      
is designed for easy gripping.  

211
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,010
a worker clamps one of the handles in a fixture.   

212
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:44,081
it holds the handle steady as he drills rivet holes in both ends.              

213
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,218
the fixture also helps locate the holes      

214
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,820
through lined channels called bushings.         

215
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,824
by drilling through the bushings,      

216
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,961
he produces accurate rivet holes every time.           

217
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,231
in the meantime, the comb assembly        

218
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,300
has been plated with a rust-resistant nickel   

219
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,103
and chrome finish.        

220
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,973
it's ready to be joined to the handle.          

221
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,374
an employee aligns the holes in the comb           

222
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,710
with the holes in the handle,  

223
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:13,912
and places them in a riveter.  

224
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,516
the tool flattens the rivets against the handle        

225
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,218
on both sides.          

226
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,390
then, she dabs adhesive around the open ends       

227
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:32,063
of the handle and inserts plastic caps.    

228
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,806
she hammers the caps down.    

229
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,910
the glue sets quickly, creating a strong seal.     

230
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,285
after about a half hour of work,              

231
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,354
this pet grooming comb is now complete.         

232
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,024
it should last for many years.  

233
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,893
there will, no doubt, be many tangles ahead,      

234
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,828
but this comb will pull through them.     

235
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,066
and, in the end, fido will look and feel a whole lot better.   

236
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:28,052
narrator: stained glass windows add beauty and light to places of     

237
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,721
over time, exposure to the elements and pollution  

238
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,723
can cause the glass, metal framework,         

239
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,926
and glazing to deteriorate.   

240
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,796
restoration ensures the survival of these sacred works of art   

241
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,632
for future generations.     

242
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,205
they are incredible picture windows.             

243
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,342
each stained glass panel depicts a religious scene.    

244
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,147
but it is a fragile art,     

245
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:01,753
and often, only a restoration can ensure its survival.     

246
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,822
it starts with a thorough evaluation.           

247
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,292
an assessor photographs the window.     

248
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:10,428
she examines every part as well as measures the panes  

249
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,498
and connecting lead strips known as cames.         

250
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,768
she numbers the parts and loads information      

251
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,237
about their condition into a computer.         

252
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,373
these cames are in bad shape,  

253
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,708
so they'll need to completely disassemble the panel              

254
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,710
and rebuild it.         

255
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,646
first, they make a rubbing.   

256
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,180
a member of the team       

257
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,917
places a large sheet of paper over the back of the window.   

258
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,987
he rubs a wax crayon over the raised led strips    

259
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,321
to transfer the pattern     

260
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,659
of the panes.          

261
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:43,327
after testing the condition of the paint on the panes,    

262
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,598
he submerges the glass in a non-acidic cleaning solution,            

263
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,933
and leaves it overnight.     

264
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,670
this softens the glazing cement between the lead strips     

265
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,141
so the window can be easily disassembled.   

266
00:17:56,143 --> 00:18:00,144
he clips off the lead strips.  

267
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,546
he extracts the glass and cleans off the glazing    

268
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,084
using a straight-edged razor.  

269
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,554
he gently scrubs off residue with a soft-bristle brush,    

270
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:13,425
and wipes the glass clean.    

271
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,896
he pieces together the glass panes within the paper pattern.            

272
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,897
most of the panes are in good condition      

273
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,966
and can be preserved.      

274
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,435
but one is fractured       

275
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:26,571
and held together with special conservation tape.              

276
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,040
they'll need to replace it.   

277
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,843
a craftsperson traces the outline of the cracked piece              

278
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,179
onto a new piece of glass.    

279
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:41,185
she scores the new glass, giving the outline a wide margin.    

280
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,122
she snaps the glass along the score line,      

281
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,994
then cuts the glass along the tracing lines.     

282
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:51,128
she compares the pieces to confirm            

283
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,798
they have the same silhouette.  

284
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,668
she copies the designs onto the new pane        

285
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,870
and mixes a matte paint that matches the one       

286
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,406
on the broken pane.       

287
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,875
she then shades the designs on the new pane         

288
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,877
with the matte paint.      

289
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,146
she dabs it with a brush to create fine,         

290
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,415
crisscrossed lines.       

291
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,083
then, she switches to a brush  

292
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,285
with shorter and stiffer bristles.            

293
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,887
she removes some of the paint, following the designs      

294
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,089
on the pane.           

295
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,292
this creates highlights.     

296
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,895
she fires the glass in a hot kiln,          

297
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,497
and then lowers the temperature to anneal it.          

298
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,435
this process reduces brittleness.       

299
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:34,772
switch compares the replicated pane to the broken one.     

300
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:39,044
she joins all the stained glass panes using new lead cames.   

301
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,650
she taps the panes gently with a rubber mallet       

302
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:50,254
to fit them snugly       
into the grooves of the cames.  

303
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,591
this lead matrix will both unify the numerous panes        

304
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:57,062
and create visual interest with bold strokes.        

305
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,601
using an electric soldering iron,   

306
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,670
she melts tin and lead solder  

307
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:10,208
where the channeled lead strips intersect.            

308
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,013
these solder joints hold the window's lead skeleton together.            

309
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,282
another team member applies glazing cement      

310
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:22,620
across the front and back of the stained glass panel.   

311
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,622
the cement provides waterproofing      

312
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,257
and added strength.       

313
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,897
he sprinkles calcium carbonate onto the wet cement.       

314
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,166
it's known as whiting.      

315
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:38,503
the whiting soaks up excess oil in the glaze.          

316
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:43,708
as he brushes it off, it    
cleans and polishes the panel.  

317
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,844
he trims the cement around the lead strips      

318
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,780
to give them a clean edge.    

319
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,683
finally, he vacuums up the glazing residue.       

320
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,254
with the restoration complete,  

321
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,525
he props the stained glass panel against a backlight.       

322
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,328
it shines like new when illuminated.        

323
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,398
it's taken about a week     

324
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,802
to restore this stained glass window.    

325
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,203
it should last another century  

326
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,739
or more, providing plenty of opportunities         

327
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,674
for spiritual reflection.    

328
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,822
