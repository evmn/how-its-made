narrator: the mobile concert stage    

4
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:58,057
was invented in canada in the 1980s.         

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,793
it uses hydraulics to fold into
a trailer for transport    

6
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,598
and then unfolds upon arrival at the event venue.      

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,602
it takes 45 minutes for a crew to set up a mobile stage,   

8
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,604
and then it's show time.    

9
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,976
no stage? no problem.     

10
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,746
just order a mobile hydraulic stage,   

11
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,349
and in less than an hour, you're ready to rock 'n' roll. 

12
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,952
the convenience means     

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,922
it has plenty of fans in the event-production industry. 

14
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:35,428
a mobile stage starts with the trailer framework.  

15
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,932
a worker saws aluminum beams to length.           

16
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,435
at the same time, another member of the team   

17
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,571
pieces together aluminum tubing
for the roof.         

18
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,942
he welds the joints to complete
the roof's skeleton.      

19
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:56,515
he then welds the trailer support structure together.  

20
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,251
with the girders assembled,  

21
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:03,656
the trailer's substructure is ready for the axles and wheels.

22
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:07,326
each axle can support 10,000 pounds of weight.    

23
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:15,201
they install hydraulic cylinders
on each corner of the trailer. 

24
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,670
these cylinders are the extendable legs      

25
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,841
that will stabilize      
the stage trailer on the ground.

26
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,752
next up is a panel with valves to control           

27
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,720
the flow of hydraulic fluid.  

28
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,294
they bolt the panel to the back
of the trailer         

29
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,963
and connect hoses to the valves.

30
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,899
this network of hoses     

31
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:49,702
will circulate fluid for the hydraulics.      

32
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:57,309
they cover the valves and hoses
with a metal plate.      

33
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:01,247
the plate has slots for control levers.      

34
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,052
they screw the levers to the valves.         

35
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,995
he then installs a hydraulic pressure gauge.  

36
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,965
the team now lowers the tank for the hydraulic fluid    

37
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:27,139
into the base frame and secures it.        

38
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,742
they run the hoses for the hydraulic fluid    

39
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,745
through a filter at the entrance
to the tank.          

40
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:43,489
they're ready for the extendable
supports for the stage mast.  

41
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,558
using a forklift, they maneuver
the parts into place      

42
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,894
at the ends of the trailer.  

43
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,896
they return to the floor    

44
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,833
and bolt six hydraulic cylinders
into the framework.      

45
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,270
they'll be used to lift and lower the floors.     

46
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,581
the roof structure is next.  

47
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,851
a crane does the lifting,   

48
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,453
and a worker guides the panels onto the beams.        

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,459
they secure the panels with hinges, torquing them tightly. 

50
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,931
the team transfers the floor panels        

51
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,600
to both sides of the main chassis.      

52
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,070
the install leg jacks to support them.        

53
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,775
there are eight jacks for each floor panel.     

54
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,151
they install more hydraulic cylinders    

55
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,220
for raising and lowering the floor.           

56
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,227
this mobile concert stage is ready for the outer skin.  

57
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:01,500
an employee glues fiberglass sheeting to the sides.     

58
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,805
a team then lays the plywood floors sheet by sheet.     

59
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,780
the plywood is marine-grade.  

60
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,317
it has a laminate composite surface. 

61
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,587
the laminate is textured for skid resistance.      

62
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:28,127
it's also waterproof for outdoor events.      

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
once all the paneling is in place,          

64
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,872
this mobile stage is ready to go on tour.      

65
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,541
eight weeks in the making,   

66
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,511
it will be a time-saver on the road.          

67
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,431
narrator: one way to enhance eyelashes  

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,434
is to coat them with mascara. 

69
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:12,904
early mascaras were made of petroleum jelly and coal  

70
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,441
or soap cake tinted with black dye.     

71
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,977
today's liquid mascara comes in a tube        

72
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,914
with an applicator brush built right into the cap.   

73
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,788
mascara formulations vary.   

74
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,994
the basic ingredients are wax, water, pigment, and binders.  

75
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:37,062
additional ingredients     

76
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,965
produce features such as water resistance.   

77
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,204
every formulation is comprised of          

78
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:49,741
an oil-soluble phase and a water-soluble phase.   

79
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,410
to prepare this mascara's oil phase,   

80
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,414
a technician combines four types of wax --      

81
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,483
carnauba, from a brazilian palm tree;  

82
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,619
candelilla, from a plant that grows    

83
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,755
in parts of mexico and texas; 

84
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,557
beeswax; and glyceryl stearate,

85
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,294
an emulsifier which helps ingredients blend well.    

86
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:13,465
next comes vitamin "e," which conditions lashes    

87
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,834
and gives the mascara a smooth texture.       

88
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:20,973
after that is a chemical compound called pelemol d-2000,

89
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,442
which makes the mascara water-resistant.        

90
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:27,379
the technician heats this oil phase of the formulation. 

91
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:32,117
once the waxes begin melting, blends the ingredients.    

92
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,657
wax is a thickener.      

93
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:43,529
this calculated combination  
of four different waxes produces

94
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,433
a semiliquid gel that coats lashes with a shiny film.

95
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,537
the technician now prepares  

96
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,940
the water-soluble phase of the formulation separately, 

97
00:07:55,977 --> 00:08:01,146
first, heating up cold water, then adding an emulsifier.   

98
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,882
this will bind the water and oil phases    

99
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,884
when they're combined later on.

100
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,553
without an emulsifier,     

101
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,689
oil and water solubles would naturally separate.   

102
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,424
the next ingredient is     

103
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,360
a cosmetic-grade iron oxide pigment.      

104
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:20,432
the color is black because she's making black mascara.  

105
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:25,170
she blends the mixture until the color is uniform.  

106
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,709
then she adds t.e.a.      

107
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,046
this organic compound balances the mascara's ph level     

108
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,916
so that it isn't too acidic or alkaline.          

109
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,988
next, she adds a cosmetic powder
to make the mascara silky   

110
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:46,458
and a chemical to provide additional water resistance.  

111
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,795
finally, she completes the formulation        

112
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,397
by adding the oil phase to this water phase.      

113
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,733
heating the mixture while blending         

114
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,770
prevents the waxes from solidifying.       

115
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,473
before packaging,       

116
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:05,344
the factory's chemist runs quality-control tests.     

117
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,883
using a viscometer to measure thickness,           

118
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,554
he makes sure the mascara isn't runny or gooey.     

119
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,757
he also tests the ph level.  

120
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,295
if the sample meets specifications,        

121
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,565
the lab gives the go-ahead to package the mascara,    

122
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,703
and a worker pours the batch into a filling machine.    

123
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,507
the machine continuously mixes the mascara          

124
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:39,178
and keeps it hot so that it remains liquid.   

125
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,714
otherwise, the mascara would begin to cool and jellify   

126
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,884
and clog the filling nozzle.  

127
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,456
a mascara bottle typically contains       

128
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,092
about 2 ounces of mascara.   

129
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,460
as it cools in the bottle,   

130
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:59,031
it transforms into a semiliquid gel.     

131
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:02,734
she seals the bottle      

132
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,105
by pressing in         
a plunger-style plastic stopper.

133
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,344
the stopper has a hole in the middle for inserting  

134
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:16,648
the brush applicator that's built into the bottle's cap.  

135
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,288
the lip of the stopper hole is designed to wipe off    

136
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,559
excess mascara as you pull the brush out of the bottle.  

137
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:32,564
this helps prevent the mascara from clumping.         

138
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,770
this manufacturer fills small orders manually,     

139
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,039
like this one for a private-label brand.   

140
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:45,510
its automated production line is reserved for large orders. 

141
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,779
regardless of quantity,    

142
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,315
clients specify the characteristics they want 

143
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,917
in their brand of mascara,   

144
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,986
such as lengthening or water resistance,      

145
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:59,057
and the manufacturer tailors the formulation accordingly.  

146
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,411
narrator: the continuous miner is always on the job.     

147
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,815
this machine constantly bores into deposits of coal,  

148
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,619
salt, or pot ash to break them into little pieces.      

149
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,488
its invention in america in the 1940s          

150
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:32,724
was an earth-shattering development.          

151
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:41,266
the continuous miner is a force
to be reckoned with underground.

152
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:46,572
a spinning drum is spiked with tungsten carbide teeth.  

153
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,707
it tears into the rock face  

154
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,977
and spits the pieces out onto a conveyor.        

155
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,185
the continuous miner can remove
24 tons of minerals per minute.

156
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:05,490
that's more than a human miner can dig in an entire day.   

157
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,528
the work is hard on the equipment,       

158
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,731
and, so, eventually, the continuous miner      

159
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,067
undergoes a complete rebuild. 

160
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,537
it starts with an extensive cleaning.     

161
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,205
after a steam wash,      

162
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,541
a worker aims a torch at the bolts of the drum.   

163
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,278
the heat causes the bolts to expand           

164
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,146
and move away from the hole.  

165
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,282
this makes it easier to pull them out,       

166
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,584
using a pneumatic impact wrench.

167
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,822
once all the bolts have been removed,       

168
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,526
the drum can be pried from the shaft.        

169
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:46,965
once free, a crane lifts the heavy drum, 

170
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,102
and workers guide it to the next station.      

171
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,838
here, a worker in protective gear       

172
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,241
blasts the drum with tiny steel shot.     

173
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,877
this removes any remaining dirt and grime. 

174
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,318
some parts, like these centrifugal loading arms,   

175
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:10,788
are beyond repair, so they build new ones.    

176
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,391
connected to a hub,      

177
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,659
these arms will move mined material         

178
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,795
onto the machine's conveyor.  

179
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,599
a worker reinforces each one with a wear plate.       

180
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,336
he then heats the wear plate and loading arm        

181
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,739
before welding them together. 

182
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,207
preheating reduces       

183
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,110
the possibility of the weld cracking.     

184
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,082
they lower the loading-arm assembly    

185
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,017
into the machine framework.  

186
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,959
then a computerized cutter carves a sheet of steel    

187
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:51,697
to make new access panels for the continuous miner.   

188
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,836
the slicing force       
comes from a pressurized mixture

189
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,306
of water and garnet granules. 

190
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,608
no blade is necessary.     

191
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,315
the operator of the machine hoses off the filings.     

192
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,854
he retrieves the cut part with a magnet.         

193
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:20,058
over to the conveyor part of the continuous miner now.  

194
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,261
they had built up the hole for the pivot pin       

195
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,730
because it had stretched from wear.           

196
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,466
a tool mills the built-up hole 

197
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:31,169
to return it to the correct diameter.    

198
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,477
the team then focuses on    

199
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,413
the main frames of the continuous miner.    

200
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,082
they weld the cracks and grind them smooth.     

201
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,021
now beginning with the conveyor tail,    

202
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,824
a worker spray paints the continuous miner      

203
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,826
one piece at a time.      

204
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,665
another member of the team   

205
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:04,369
inserts new plugs into an electrical control box.

206
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,041
he bolts the panel,      

207
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,278
holding electrical controls to the machine casing.     

208
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,585
he then installs heavy doors that swing open        

209
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,955
so the electrical can be easily accessed.        

210
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,127
there are a total of 25 covers and doors     

211
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,464
on the continuous miner.    

212
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,468
some protect hydraulic hoses. 

213
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,137
others encase the wiring or gear boxes.         

214
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:41,673
they can all be removed    

215
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,209
if maintenance needs to be performed.     

216
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,082
it's taken several months for this massive overhaul,   

217
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,852
and they're ready to put this rebuilt continuous miner 

218
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,621
to the test.          

219
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,223
using the machine's remote control,        

220
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,027
a technician checks the function
of every component.      

221
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,497
with his approval,       

222
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,766
the continuous miner goes back underground     

223
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,769
to pick up where it left off. 

224
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,852
narrator: a product presented in a beautiful,        

225
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,255
high-quality, wooden box is sure to stand out.     

226
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,993
companies use them as special-event displays   

227
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,128
or as corporate gift boxes.  

228
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,264
because they're handmade,   

229
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,767
the boxes can be customized to showcase each product.   

230
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,407
wood gift boxes make wonderful cases for spirit bottles,   

231
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:53,144
collectible coins, watches, or christmas ornaments.    

232
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,147
not only do they display the product beautifully,    

233
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,816
they also protect the contents inside.      

234
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:02,287
today, they're making a box with maple boards,       

235
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:06,424
which are cut on an automated saw.      

236
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,426
a mortiser's parallel blades  

237
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,830
cut square-shaped notches at the end of each plank.   

238
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,700
these will serve to finger joint
the sides of the box later on. 

239
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,703
the pieces of wood are pressed against the corner   

240
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,040
so that the resulting fingers are perfectly aligned.     

241
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,908
the factory usually makes fingers     

242
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,777
that are 6 millimeters wide.  

243
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,646
wider fingers would be unsightly,      

244
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,682
and thinner ones would be too fragile.          

245
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:35,253
they now prepare the top of the wood box.    

246
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,322
a press uses heat and pressure 

247
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,992
to stamp the company's logo on the surface of the wood.  

248
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,828
they brand the wood with a magnesium plate,    

249
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,331
heating to 840 degrees fahrenheit.          

250
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,201
the process takes just two seconds.       

251
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,471
next, they assemble the sides, 

252
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,673
interlocking the pieces manually.           

253
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,475
they use a rubber mallet    

254
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,478
to avoid damaging or denting the wood.           

255
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:04,148
when the four sides are end to end,          

256
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,217
they apply a small amount of wood glue          

257
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,287
on the inside of each joint.  

258
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,958
they form the corners at a 90-degree angle.     

259
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,560
once the box is assembled,   

260
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,864
a press will finish pushing in the fingers on each joint.   

261
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,502
when the box comes out of the press,         

262
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,438
they check the square.     

263
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:31,710
they apply wood glue for the bottom of the box.   

264
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,379
since the bottom is less visible,         

265
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,315
clients sometimes choose plywood
instead of solid wood     

266
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,284
to save on costs.       

267
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,924
they glue a solid maple top,  

268
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,726
and the boxes go into press for 35 minutes         

269
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,861
until the glue dries.     

270
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:57,201
after sanding, a router shapes the edge of the box's top.   

271
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,471
by changing the router-bit,  

272
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:03,608
they can create all kinds of decorative profiles.    

273
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,278
this one is simply rounded.  

274
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:13,084
they sand the whole box again with 120-grit sandpaper,    

275
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,087
and finish with 180-grit sandpaper.    

276
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,160
now they can cut the box open, starting at the back.     

277
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,028
they create a wide angle    

278
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,699
so the lid can open freely on its hinges.         

279
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,367
next, they make a straight cut 

280
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,769
through each of the three remaining sides, 

281
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,772
sawing the box in half.    

282
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,507
they separate the body from the lid,         

283
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,642
and the two match up perfectly.

284
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,112
each half of the box      

285
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,716
goes on an automated milling machine called a slotter.   

286
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,019
it cuts the slots in the wood on the back of the box.    

287
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:53,258
these slots will receive the hinges.          

288
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,062
the bottom of each slot is rounded           

289
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,064
to cradle the rounded ends of the hinges.         

290
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,667
these hinges are made of nickel-plated metal.    

291
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,668
they're designed to be pressure fitted,     

292
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,472
so they won't need any screws to stay in place.       

293
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,741
the worker uses a rubber mallet

294
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,944
to insert the hinges in the body
of the box.          

295
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,684
once the hinges are aligned with the lid,         

296
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,285
he squeezes them tight,    

297
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,955
using the hammer again if necessary.         

298
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,559
the angled cut creates enough space for the hinges  

299
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,162
and helps to open the lid.   

300
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,967
they apply a coat of sealer, lightly sand the wood,     

301
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:40,772
and finish with a coat of lacquer.    

302
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:43,107
when the lacquer is dry,    

303
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:46,577
they install the magnetic closure in a pre-drilled hole. 

304
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,047
another magnet goes into the lid,       

305
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,649
and that makes for a nice-closing box.    

306
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,786
they stick a piece of self-adhesive felt     

307
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,123
to the bottom of the box and trim the excess.      

308
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,059
next, they line the box with foam           

309
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,196
in order to protect its contents.         

310
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,399
some clients prefer thermoformed plastic trays   

311
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:13,137
molded to their product's specific shape.        

312
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,140
you can choose the size, shape,

313
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:19,210
type of wood, color, and hardware of the box.    

314
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,914
the only limit is your budget and your imagination.
