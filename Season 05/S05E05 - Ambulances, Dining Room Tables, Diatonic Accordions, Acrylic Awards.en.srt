 the notion of ambulance service

11

   a raised, aerodynamic roof.  

30

     lessens air resistance,

     enabling the ambulance     
     to run more efficiently

35

     with adhesive caulking.

00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,476
 the roof has integrated lights.

39
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,346
        protruding lights       
   would ruin the streamline.

236
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,590
        pressing a button       
 triggers the rocker underneath 

237
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,059

    hit the designated reeds.   

239
