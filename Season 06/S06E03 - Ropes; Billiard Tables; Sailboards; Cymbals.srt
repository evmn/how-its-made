00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,656
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,127
           ...ropes...          

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,899
      ...billiard tables...     

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,238
        ...sailboards...        

5
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,144
         ...and cymbals.        

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,188
     years ago, making rope     
  was a time-consuming process. 

7
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,790
       they stretched yarn      
      700 to 1,000 feet --      

8
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,259
    sometimes down alleys --    

9
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,527
    and secured it on hooks.    

10
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,062
    then, they turned wheels    
      to rotate the hooks,      

11
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,998
  twisting the yarn into rope.  

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,267
    this technique was called   
          a rope walk.          

13
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,637
luckily, today, we have machines
   to do all the work for us.   

14
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,145
    these ropes are made from   
    thousands of nylon fibers   

15
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,348
 that are finer than human hair 
          but stronger.         

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,685
    to make rope, yarns wind    
    around aluminum cylinders   

17
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,288
    pulled by a turning spool   
         down the line.         

18
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,758
then, three at a time, the yarns
     roll over another spool    

19
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,494
    that applies a protective   
      coating of urethane.      

20
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,629
       they funnel through      
      a distribution plate      

21
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,764
  that holds them evenly apart. 

22
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,766
          this ensures          
   they're at an even tension   

23
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:44,770
 as a rocking spool twists them 
      into one larger yarn.     

24
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,311
     this machine is called     
         the whirlwind.         

25
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,713
       it twists the yarn       

26
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:58,917
     and then winds it onto     
     a take-up spool inside.    

27
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,919
          a little arm          
      moves back and forth,     

28
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,056
     guiding the yarn so it     
  winds evenly onto the spool.  

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:09,061
 this is core yarn, and it will 
   be used to make other rope.  

30
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,333
  now dozens of spools of nylon 
  fiber unwind at the same time 

31
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,203
   to make jackets to protect   
         the core yarns.        

32
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:22,007
 the fibers travel several feet 
    over a network of rollers   

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,008
       that act as guides       
       and control tension      

34
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,278
    on each individual fiber.   

35
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,614
        they pass through       
       distribution plates      

36
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,617
    as turning bobbins below    
   twist the fibers into yarn.  

37
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,420
  a platform moves up and down  

38
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,756
     to evenly wind the yarn    
        onto the bobbin.        

39
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,226
 they place 48 of these bobbins 
    on the maypole machine --   

40
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,695
            so called           
   because the braiding action  

41
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,431
    resembles a dance around    
     a traditional maypole.     

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,104
   the bobbins spin and zigzag  
        around each other       

43
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:55,307
 as the machine pulls core yarn 
     up through the center.     

44
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,910
here, you can see the rope being
  braided around the core yarn  

45
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,313
as it's pulled up through a die.

46
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,016
   this is the braiding action  
         in slow motion.        

47
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:13,592
 it produces a mountain-climbing
   rope -- strong yet stretchy  

48
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,728
      because of the twist      
    in the core of the rope.    

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,398
  the rope winds onto the wheel 
     as it pulls it upwards.    

50
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,400
  then it spills into a basket. 

51
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,135
a worker pulls out a sample rope

52
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,404
    to checks its flexibility   
          and strength.         

53
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,974
    he bends it to make sure    
      it will knot easily.      

54
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,681
   now another maypole braider  
     weaves a synthetic rope    

55
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,217
   that's stronger than steel   
  yet lightweight and flexible. 

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,286
   that's because the strands   
           at the core          

57
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,821
           are braided          
     with a material called     

58
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,690
   ultra-high molecular weight  
          polyethylene.         

59
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,493
     it's a high-performance    
         thermoplastic.         

60
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,829
     this rope will be used     
     for advanced yachting.     

61
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,966
  a pulley draws this high-tech 
  rope through some metal pipes 

62
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,368
       filled with steam.       

63
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,371
   this shrinks the polyester   
 jacket around the powerful core

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,106
        for a tight fit.        

65
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,377
      these dancing bobbins     
       do some fancy moves      

66
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,114
   to produce different weaves  
       around core ropes.       

67
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,383
         they dip around        
     and between each other     

68
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,984
  in a choreographed sequence.  

69
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,987
 but there are no worries about 
  production hitting a snarl -- 

70
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,024
        if a yarn breaks,       
 the machine simply shuts down. 

71
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,397
       it takes 8-10 hours      
    to make around 3,000 feet   

72
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,599
   of this large utility rope.  

73
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,539
   now for the strength test.   

74
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,742
they loop a sample piece of rope
       around steel posts.      

75
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,945
            this one            
    is a nylon double braid,    

76
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,014
  the type used for dock lines  
            on boats.           

77
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,550
       hydraulic pressure       
     pulls the rope upwards     

78
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,152
   while a computerized gauge   
      measures the tension      

79
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,188
           and detects          
       the breaking point.      

80
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,429
     almost 20,000 pounds --    

81
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,964
        that's the weight       
       of a killer whale.       

82
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,802
        needless to say,        
     this rope is just fine.    

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,774
     now for another test --    

84
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,710
   they insert a steel probe,   
         known as a fid,        

85
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,378
   into some industrial rope,   

86
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:17,449
   then place the pointed end   
          into a hole.          

87
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,385
        an electric motor       
      forces the fid though     

88
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,120
     while a gauge measures     
       the force it takes       

89
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,991
 for it to completely penetrate 
            the rope.           

90
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,660
  it took 10 pounds of pressure 

91
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,862
        to push the probe       
        through the rope,       

92
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,732
      which means this rope     
      is firm yet flexible.     

93
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,774
         and that's how         
    this useful item is made.   

94
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,826
 the game of billiards has been 
  around in one form or another 

95
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,494
 for nearly 500 years.          

96
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,228
 during the 19th century,       

97
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,098
 the game's rules               
 and equipment evolved          

98
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,566
 to basically                   
 what they are today.           

99
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,168
 billiards, also known as pool, 

100
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,036
  is played on a slate tabletop 

101
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,573
 that's usually 8'3½" long      

102
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,676
 and 4'7½" wide.                

103
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,314
  clients order billiard tables 

104
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,516
 much like they would           
 custom-designed furniture.     

105
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,853
 they pick the table's style,   
 colors, the type of wood,      

106
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,788
 and its lacquer and stain.     

107
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,726
 the tables come in maple,      
 walnut, mahogany,              

108
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,529
 cherry,                        
 and the most popular, oak.     

109
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,066
 a computer-guided machine      

110
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,802
 shapes part of what'll be      
 the table's frame.             

111
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:48,073
this machine's rotating heads   
perform several different tasks.

112
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,810
 a profiling head carves        
 the angle of part of the frame,

113
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,613
 a routering head creates       
 the table's decorative grooves,

114
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,750
 and a drilling head makes holes
 for bolts to fit through.      

115
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,887
 six wood components,           
 called rails,                  

116
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,088
 will surround                  
 the playing surface.           

117
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,091
 they have                      
 diamond-shaped carvings        

118
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,560
  that'll become visual markers 
  for the players.              

119
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,695
 after spraying the rails       
 with glue,                     

120
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,565
 a worker inserts               
 18 metal nuts.                 

121
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,101
 they'll be used later          
 to secure the rails            

122
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,502
 to the playing surface.        

123
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,172
 he attaches rubber strips      
 along the sticky rails,        

124
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,573
 which are just over            
 three feet long.               

125
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,577
 the rubber will cushion the    
 balls when they hit the sides. 

126
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,846
 the rails then pass through    
 a press twice                  

127
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,649
  to ensure the rubber adheres. 

128
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,384
 next, workers move the rails   

129
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,853
 along this 30-foot-long        
 sanding machine.               

130
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,922
 rubber wheels                  
 gently grip each rail          

131
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,391
    as presses rub sandpaper    
     along the edge and top.    

132
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,194
      they skip the bottom      
    because it'll be covered.   

133
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,930
   they pass the rails through  
    this sander several times   

134
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,599
      to smooth them down.      

135
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,868
  to make sure everything fits, 

136
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,938
 a worker pre-assembles the four
  sides and the middle section  

137
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,473
      of the frame's base.      

138
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,276
     he uses 20 metal bolts     
    and 20 nuts to join them.   

139
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,145
         and he inserts         
       eight wooden dowels      

140
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,747
        in order to align       
   the table parts correctly.   

141
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,952
        he stamps numbers       
      on the frame sections     

142
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,954
so they can be reassembled later

143
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,923
       by pairing the same      
    numbered parts together.    

144
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,828
    next, a worker hot glues    
        18 one-inch-long        

145
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,832
   mother-of-pearl components   
         called sights.         

146
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,834
        he fits them into       
    the carvings on the rails   

147
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,305
   which have now been stained  
      to the desired shade.     

148
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,240
     he taps them into place    

149
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,776
   using a hammer and a block   
    made of synthetic resin.    

150
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,046
        this way he won't       
        damage the rail.        

151
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,582
 a worker then lines the rubber 
   part of the rail with cloth  

152
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,716
     made of wool and nylon.    

153
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,519
         he attaches it         
      with a plastic strip      

154
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,121
    that fits over the cloth    
       and into a groove.       

155
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,458
   he uses a mallet to ensure   
 the cloth is tightly inserted. 

156
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,060
           the worker           
     then staples the cloth     

157
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,396
        to the other side       
          of the rail.          

158
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,333
a zinc and brass plaque displays
     the table's brand name.    

159
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,470
         after shipping,        
  workers reassemble the table  

160
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,804
        in its new home.        

161
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,408
 serial numbers ensure the parts
    belong to the same table.   

162
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,811
 assembly takes about two hours.

163
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,613
           they match           
   the numbered parts together  

164
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:12,150
      using up to 50 bolts      
          and 50 nuts.          

165
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,153
    then they level the table   

166
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,689
     using metal components     
       called leg levelers      

167
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,824
  to adjust the table's height. 

168
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:24,763
 it's like sticking a matchbook 
   under an uneven table leg.   

169
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,198
            now comes           
   the really heavy lifting --  

170
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,101
 workers fit the three sections 
       of the table's top,      

171
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,238
   which are made of slate and  
  weigh up to 300 pounds each.  

172
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,308
    slate won't degrade, and    
  it won't budge if you hit it. 

173
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,313
    the workers use 12 screws   

174
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:47,452
  to attach the slate sections  
          to the frame.         

175
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,388
  they level the sections using 
   wedge-shaped plastic shims   

176
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,924
between the slate and the frame.

177
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,795
  next, a worker melts wax over 
the cracks between the sections.

178
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,864
 he uses a scraper to smooth out
      the playing surface.      

179
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,534
       the remaining holes      
 will later be covered by rails.

180
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,736
      after the wax dries,      

181
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,205
  they cover the table surface  
           with cloth,          

182
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,541
           which comes          
     in a variety of colors.    

183
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,476
       they cut the cloth       
         in the corners         

184
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,813
so there won't be any creases in
 the lining of the pocket holes.

185
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:19,083
    they staple the cloth to    
  wood strips under the slate.  

186
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,952
   a worker pierces the cloth   
     over holes in the slate    

187
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,555
         so he can later        
        attach the rails.       

188
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,891
         the six pockets        
       are six inches deep      

189
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:31,963
  and consist of a metal frame  
 covered with a leather lattice.

190
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,234
   workers install 18 threaded  
metal rods underneath the rails.

191
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,169
then they flip the rail assembly

192
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,506
   and insert the rods through  
pre-made holes in the table top.

193
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,642
          they use nuts         
  to secure the rods in place.  

194
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,847
   screws attach the pockets,   
 and voilà, your table is ready.

195
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,917
   for prices ranging between   
       $1,500 and $15,000       

196
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,920
 you have quite a stylish game. 

197
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,464
 narrator: american newman darby
   built the first sailboards   

198
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,599
        during the 1960s.       

199
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,870
   he rigged a sail to a mast   
   on a board with a tail fin   

200
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,672
  and rode the wind and waves.  

201
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,475
   today's windsurfers can pay  
    several thousand dollars    

202
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,144
    for their high-tech gear.   

203
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,781
      this includes a sail,     
    a mast, and a sailboard.    

204
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,352
      to make a sailboard,      

205
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,289
       workers start with       
   a long block of styrofoam.   

206
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,090
  they attach a wood template,  

207
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,827
   pushing nails through holes  
 in the wood and into the block.

208
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,497
  using an electrically heated  
    tool, called a hot-wire,    

209
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,568
   they slice the block along   
the curved line of the template.

210
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,238
   the result is what's known   
          as the core.          

211
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:52,977
   they use styrofoam because   
  it's lightweight and buoyant. 

212
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,181
  next, a worker guides what's  
   known as a shaper machine.   

213
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,584
 it outlines a template, called 
   a masterboard, on the left,  

214
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,121
  while a spindle cuts grooves  
   into the core on the right.  

215
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,723
   the grooves are guidelines   
        to carve the core       

216
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,459
         into the shape         
  of the masterboard later on.  

217
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,662
      the shaper's 40-pound     
          counterweight         

218
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,798
  lets the spindle gently hover 
   above the core as it cuts.   

219
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,634
styrofoam dust flies everywhere,

220
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:21,672
so the worker wears a protective
   mask to avoid inhaling it.   

221
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,942
          a worker then         
     saws along the grooves     

222
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,745
      to reveal the initial     
     shape of the sailboard.    

223
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,781
         another worker         
    then sands down the core.   

224
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,419
     next, he applies almost    
   1 1/2 pounds of epoxy resin  

225
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,558
 onto carbon fabric to reinforce
the material and make it sticky.

226
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,429
  another worker applies resin  
      on fiberglass fabric.     

227
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,297
    these strong, lightweight   
            materials           

228
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,698
     are part of the board's    

229
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,168
    fabric-and-foam-sandwich    
          construction.         

230
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,569
   they'll harden inside molds  

231
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,771
         of the board's         
     top and bottom sections    

232
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,642
   during the curing later on.  

233
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,646
  the workers carefully scrape  
  away about 20% of the resin.  

234
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,449
     too much and the board     
     could crack during use.    

235
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,324
        here, the worker        
      spreads thicker resin     

236
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,795
   onto a piece of rigid foam   
  that's 1/8 of an inch thick.  

237
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,864
          he places it          
      into the bottom mold      

238
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,333
    and attaches a hand-sized   
        plastic component       

239
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,202
        called a fin box.       

240
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:28,339
 it'll hold the sailboard's fin,
   which helps the user steer.  

241
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,340
        they add kevlar,        

242
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,609
      an ultra-lightweight      
        synthetic fabric,       

243
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:36,013
    as the final outer layer    
   on the core's bottom side.   

244
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,350
 after applying resin to another
      piece of rigid foam,      

245
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,618
     a worker cuts openings     

246
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,087
 through which other components 
         will later fit.        

247
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,423
           this layer           
   is placed into the top mold  

248
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,559
      and covered with more     
         carbon fabric.         

249
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,900
 next, a worker places the core 
      into the bottom mold.     

250
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:59,837
 he fits two plastic components,
   called foot strap inserts,   

251
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,840
       into openings lined      
     with fiberglass fabric     

252
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,108
         to secure them.        

253
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,644
   another plastic component,   
      called a mast track,      

254
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,648
  fits through an opening lined 
 with a stronger carbon fabric. 

255
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,117
      the track will later      
          anchor a mast         

256
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,186
  measuring up to 20 feet high. 

257
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,323
     strips of carbon fabric    
    also reinforce the areas    

258
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,425
where the windsurfer will stand.

259
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,329
 workers join the mold sections 

260
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,597
   and insert the whole thing   
       into a plastic sack      

261
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,933
      called a vacuum bag.      

262
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,871
   they tape the end shut but   
  leave two smaller holes open. 

263
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,674
      they attach two hoses     
   to collars in these holes.   

264
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,210
   an electric pump then takes  
       about three minutes      

265
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,145
       to suck all the air      
         out of the bag.        

266
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,283
     as the air is removed,     

267
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,486
    pressure forces the mold    
 sections even closer together. 

268
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,893
 after curing in an oven at 100 
 degrees fahrenheit for 5 hours,

269
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,830
        workers separate        
       the mold sections.       

270
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,097
     using a rotary grinder,    

271
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,567
       a worker trims away      
     excess hardened fabric     

272
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,302
    and foam along the edge.    

273
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,838
         the whole board        
  got a coat of primer earlier, 

274
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,709
     but now a worker sands     
  the paint off along the edge. 

275
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,511
       they place a strip       
        of carbon fabric        

276
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,846
   all the way around the edge  

277
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:18,115
          and secure it         
     with thin plastic wrap.    

278
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,585
       after more curing,       
    the wrapping is removed,    

279
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,921
          and the board         
       is sealed for good.      

280
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,523
       next, the sailboard      
      gets another skin --      

281
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,392
  two coats of urethane paint.  

282
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,929
        a worker locates        
   the foot strap insert holes  

283
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,665
       and cleans them out      
       with a router bit.       

284
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,200
        he uses a router        

285
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,871
       to clean the inside      
   of the mast-track opening.   

286
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:44,342
    an enormous vinyl sticker   
gives the board its personality.

287
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,211
     a worker smoothes away     
        any air bubbles.        

288
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,513
     then, after inscribing     
   the sailboard's dimensions   

289
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:53,017
       and serial number,       
       he signs the board.      

290
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,686
    finally, workers glue on    
      two rubber cushions,      

291
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,355
        called deck pads.       

292
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,756
           for $1,900,          

293
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,927
    you've got the foundation   
 of a very cool gliding machine.

294
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,836
   narrator: people have been   
 crashing cymbals for centuries.

295
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:16,640
  history tells us that cymbals 
were used in israel in 1100 b.c.

296
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,710
       over the centuries,      
       the finest cymbals       

297
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,712
have been manufactured in turkey

298
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,981
      with a secret method      
      for blending metals.      

299
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,983
     and those time-honored     
           techniques           

300
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,020
          still resound         
     in cymbal-making today.    

301
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,868
 cymbals play an important role 
    in today's music making.    

302
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,736
           each cymbal          
     has its own character,     

303
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,139
       resulting in subtle      
      differences in tone.      

304
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,742
        to make cymbals,        
    they start with castings.   

305
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,545
    in this case they're made   
  of a secret blend of copper,  

306
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,549
     tin, and trace amounts     
           of silver.           

307
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,752
 a worker sorts them by weight. 

308
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,354
       then a moving tray       
  that's powered hydraulically  

309
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,556
  takes them to a rotary oven.  

310
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:11,496
    1,500 degrees fahrenheit    
      softens the castings,     

311
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,898
  and then workers shovel them  
      into a rolling mill.      

312
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,035
    it squeezes them between    
    two big metal cylinders.    

313
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,572
   and the effect is the same   
   as rolling out pie crust --  

314
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,143
  the castings become thinner,  
      flatter, and larger.      

315
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,513
    these castings go through   
   a heating and rolling cycle  

316
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:32,450
   up to 12 times depending on  
 the type of cymbal being made. 

317
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,393
      the repeated heating      
        and cross-rolling       

318
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,395
        creates a dense,        
       interlocking weave       

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,331
    in the granular structure   
          of the alloy.         

320
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:52,069
 it will make the cymbals strong
 enough to take a real beating. 

321
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,072
the interlocking weave will also
    help transmit sound waves   

322
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,708
 more rapidly across the cymbal.

323
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,351
        after the cymbal        
        has been tempered       

324
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,287
           and pressed          
      into its final shape,     

325
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,890
   they place it on a spindle.  

326
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,960
         while it spins,        
circular cutters shear the edges

327
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,595
       to a set diameter.       

328
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,837
  next, the cymbal is pounded.  

329
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,907
       a hydraulic engine       
 powers this hammering cylinder,

330
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,311
     and a computer program     
       directs the force.       

331
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,646
  these impressions will enrich 
       the cymbal's sound       

332
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,382
      by changing the path      
       of the sound waves.      

333
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,655
      next, the application     
        of tonal grooves.       

334
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:52,163
 this craftsman puts the cymbal 
on a lathe, bottom side forward.

335
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,931
   the cymbal spins on an axle  

336
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,134
     while the lathing blade    
          cuts into it.         

337
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,139
         he starts with         
    a hand-held lathing tool    

338
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,610
    and then switches to one    
 that's mounted on the machine. 

339
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,945
  lathing removes the cymbal's  
           outer layer          

340
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,348
   and carves those important   
     tonal grooves into it.     

341
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,350
     the depth and position     
            will vary           

342
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,622
      depending on the type     
    of cymbal being produced.   

343
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,858
 he lathes the top of the cymbal
        entirely by hand        

344
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,895
    so he can better control    
 the amount of pressure applied.

345
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,364
      watch those fingers.      

346
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,833
         don't worry --         
    he knows what he's doing.   

347
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,836
   he's honed his skills over   
  five years of apprenticeship, 

348
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:35,573
    and no automatic machine    
  can duplicate the fine touch  

349
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,309
        of an experienced       
        cymbal craftsman.       

350
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,984
         now he removes         
    the newly grooved cymbal    

351
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,721
         and puts it on         
       an edging machine.       

352
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,859
    a big, round metal clamp    
   locks the cymbal in place.   

353
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,662
  it spins while a cutting tool 
      smoothes out the edge     

354
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,996
         of the cymbal.         

355
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,668
         here's a before        
        and after shot --       

356
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,270
the ragged rim is before edging.

357
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,173
        the smoother one        
     at the bottom is after.    

358
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,542
  this guy has the best job --  

359
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,945
         he's in charge         
      of quality assurance.     

360
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,548
 that means he tests each cymbal

361
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,883
      before it's sent out      
      into the marketplace.     

362
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,220
         he's listening         
     for a range of sounds.     

363
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,624
       now a laser etches       
 the trademark into the cymbal. 

364
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,493
        it also engraves        
     a unique serial number.    

365
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,034
 next, a silicon pad sponges up 
     ink from a print plate     

366
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,638
 and transfers it to the cymbal.

367
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,307
now that the company logo is on,

368
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:47,178
     it's ready for shipping    
     anywhere in the world.     

369
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,048
  but this rough metal casting  
  has already come a long way.  

370
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:54,718
      it's been transformed
