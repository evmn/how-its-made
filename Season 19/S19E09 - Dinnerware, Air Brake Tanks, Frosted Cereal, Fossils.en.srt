00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,787
narrator: restaurant dinnerware
brings a lot to the table.   

2
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,523
it's known for rugged good looks,     

3
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,857
it holds up to heavy use    

4
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,994
and repeated cleaning in commercial dishwashers,   

5
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,130
and its design reflects the restaurant's theme     

6
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,033
and adds presentation value to the food.          

7
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,739
most people appreciate the effort     

8
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,007
that goes into a fine meal,  

9
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,610
but they may not give much thought to what it takes 

10
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,880
to make the actual plate the food is served up on.   

11
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:24,416
making ceramic dinnerware that's restaurant-quality   

12
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,885
is an intensive process --   

13
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,021
one that starts with a master die made of gypsum.  

14
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,556
this worker then makes a production version      

15
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:32,691
of the master.         

16
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,892
to do this, he pours gypsum  

17
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,029
into a wire-mesh frame above the master.       

18
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,632
there's tubing attached to the mesh frame,       

19
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:40,900
and he pumps air through it.  

20
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,502
this causes the water in the gypsum         

21
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,771
to bubble out and evaporate.  

22
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,572
it dries and solidifies    

23
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,709
into a mirror image of the master --        

24
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,843
in this case, a platter shape. 

25
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,779
the tubing inside this production die   

26
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,314
will be used again later    

27
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,783
to gently blow off the platter when formed,          

28
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,186
releasing it from the die.   

29
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:03,990
another worker adds the ceramic
ingredients to water.     

30
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,726
they including a plasticizer, silica sand,  

31
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:10,863
different clays, and minerals like alumina.   

32
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:13,532
once the clay mix has been thoroughly blended,  

33
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,268
they drain it onto a vibrating sieve     

34
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,871
to screen out large mineral chunks and impurities. 

35
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,473
the clay-based liquid flows through the screen    

36
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,109
into a holding tank.      

37
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,746
they pump it through this filter press.   

38
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:29,482
it compresses fabric-covered plastic plates 

39
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,883
to squeeze out moisture,    

40
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:34,220
turning the clay liquid into putty-like slabs.     

41
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,827
with this consistency, it can now be shaped.      

42
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,763
a worker breaks up the slabs  

43
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,766
and feeds the pieces to a pug mill.         

44
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,768
the mill shapes the clay into a long cylinder,     

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,970
and, in the process, it sucks out air        

46
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:57,309
so dinnerware made from it will be less prone to cracking.

47
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,712
he slices the clay cylinder into small wads,        

48
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,580
using a wire cutter.      

49
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,584
each of these clay wads will be shaped into one plate. 

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,590
they place each wad onto molds on a revolving platform.    

51
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,659
the mold spins up to a metal tool,        

52
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,996
which presses the clay into the
shape of the plate mold below. 

53
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,599
the tool also forms the back  

54
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:24,336
so the plate will sit evenly on a table.          

55
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:30,609
a nozzle lubricates the metal tool between pressings.    

56
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,144
a cutter at the side      

57
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,881
trims the rims of the plates as they're formed.       

58
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,417
unlike the platter die,    

59
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,886
these molds don't have tubing inside to blow off the plates. 

60
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:46,291
instead, the heat from the dryer
separates them from the molds. 

61
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,961
once out of the molds, the plates spin on pedestals  

62
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:53,632
past a sponge to smooth the edges.      

63
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,767
to make coffee mugs,      

64
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,969
the pug mill presses out a narrower cylinder,      

65
00:03:56,971 --> 00:04:01,841
and a knife at the exit point slices it into precise wads.  

66
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,109
the wads fall into coffee-mug molds,     

67
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,580
and a tool spins the clay up against the walls of the molds 

68
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,782
to shape it into mugs.     

69
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,317
a blade at the top trims the excess        

70
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,652
from the lip of the mug.    

71
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:17,456
they pass under a long sponge to smooth the rims.      

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,458
and now for the handles.    

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,926
they make them in two-part molds

74
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,728
and dry them under an infrared light.    

75
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,866
the handles must have precisely
the same moisture content   

76
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,001
as the mugs -- around 16%.   

77
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,604
a worker dips the ends of each handle         

78
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,740
in a clay-and-glue mixture and presses it to the mug.   

79
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,942
the mugs go into a dryer,   

80
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,612
and the moisture content drops to 4%.          

81
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,483
next, they douse the mugs with glaze inside and out   

82
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,752
and bake them in a super-hot kiln.      

83
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,220
this will make the mugs chip-resistant         

84
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:53,158
and will strengthen the bond between the handle and the mug.

85
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,563
they paint the dinnerware by hand, using a ceramic stain.

86
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,432
the stain will enable it to hold up           

87
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,102
to repeated rigorous cleanings in restaurant dishwashers.   

88
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,511
for a different look, they apply
decals to some dinnerware.   

89
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,779
this artwork has been produced 

90
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:18,217
using the same hard-wearing ceramic stain.         

91
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,654
the plates then head into the oven,    

92
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:25,357
and the heat fuses the decorative touches to them.

93
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,730
from a liquid clay mix     

94
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,666
to tableware you can dine out on.      

95
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:37,402
the process has taken about 24 hours.        

96
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,439
it should serve you well.   

97
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,423
narrator: air-brake tanks are part of powerful brake systems 

98
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,824
on tractor trailers and buses. 

99
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,960
when the driver depresses the brake pedal,   

100
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,429
the tank releases the compressed air       

101
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,831
to activate the brakes     

102
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,369
so the big wheels slow down and stop turning.       

103
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,644
the energy used to stop a big rig comes from air.   

104
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,912
it's compressed and stored in the brake tanks       

105
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,183
so there's always a ready supply.        

106
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,718
they make air-brake tanks from industrial-grade steel  

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,722
that's about as thick as a typical magazine.     

108
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,658
a press forces the steel around a dome form       

109
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,862
and shears the edges to produce the tank's end caps.

110
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,599
it also punches a hole in each cap for a fitting.   

111
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,469
the cap's dome shape is critical.          

112
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,737
it will allow it to withstand 

113
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:48,274
the air pressure inside the tank.        

114
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,410
the tank caps now ride a conveyor under sprayers   

115
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,082
that wash away residual oil from the pressing process.   

116
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,552
more steel sheeting feeds into another press.   

117
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,089
it's twice as thick as the steel
used to make the end caps.   

118
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,025
this press is punching and forming brackets      

119
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,629
for attaching the air tank to the trailer undercarriage, 

120
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:15,401
so these connecting parts have to be extra-strong.    

121
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,639
it takes six punches      
to shape the flat sheet of steel

122
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,042
into the curved brackets.   

123
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:28,580
here's an example of the six formative stages.  

124
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,452
machinery now flattens and cuts
bigger sheets of steel     

125
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,587
for the tank body.       

126
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,657
mechanized clamps grip the sheet along the edges 

127
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:42,127
and position it under another punch press.   

128
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,663
it perforates the steel where fittings are to be installed. 

129
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,599
it also stamps the company name

130
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,802
and other manufacturing information onto it.      

131
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,205
they feed the sheet to a roller

132
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,077
that curls it into the cylindrical tank shell.  

133
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,879
the rolling is precise,    

134
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,681
and the dimensions of the cylinder        

135
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,950
don't need any adjusting.   

136
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,820
the worker clamps it into a fixture.        

137
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,555
a carriage moves a welding torch overhead 

138
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:14,760
to join the ends and create an airtight seal.  

139
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:19,498
a worker inspects the weld.  

140
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,899
the next worker welds fittings 

141
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,903
onto the holes punched into the tank shell earlier.  

142
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,838
two of the fittings are for attaching valves    

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,842
that control the flow of compressed air.       

144
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,044
the third fitting will be used to connect a line       

145
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:35,914
for draining water formed during air compression. 

146
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,852
he reinforces the fittings with large collars       

147
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:45,024
that help the connections   
withstand any bumps on the road.

148
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,126
he places the brackets and end caps          

149
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,396
in an automatic welder and activates it.       

150
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,665
it fuses the bracket to the cap --         

151
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,068
one for each of the air tank's end caps.           

152
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,671
with both bracketed end caps  

153
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,739
now installed on the cylindrical shell,   

154
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,876
it's time to seal this air tank.

155
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,412
the tank turns on a welding lathe       

156
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:12,084
as automated welders bond them to the shell.    

157
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,621
the air-tank structure is now basically complete.   

158
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,823
it's time to put it to the test.

159
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,826
after plugging the open fittings,       

160
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,496
they pump highly compressed air
into the tank --        

161
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,030
more than it would usually handle.        

162
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,836
if it can take all the pressure,
it's deemed structurally sound. 

163
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,506
they bring the pressure down a bit and check for leaks.

164
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,908
bubbles in the water around it 

165
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,843
would indicate air is seeping out,      

166
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,645
but in this case, there are only a few ripples  

167
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,915
from the action of placing it in the water.  

168
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,651
after a cleaning, the airtight tank       

169
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,987
heads into a powder-coating station.   

170
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,857
sprayers apply the powdered resin coating to the tanks.  

171
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,860
the particles are positively charged,    

172
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,795
and the tanks are negatively charged     

173
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,665
for an instant attraction.   

174
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,800
the black powder clings to the tanks      

175
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,803
as they now travel through a gas-fired oven.   

176
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,539
the heat melts and bonds the coating          

177
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,741
to the surface of the air-brake tanks,    

178
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,145
forming a tough skin that's rust-resistant.     

179
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,282
after the tanks cool,     

180
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,618
a worker inserts a long, thin paint gun     

181
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,886
through one of the fittings  

182
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:24,289
to spray a rustproof coating on the inside.         

183
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,760
he then inserts plugs into all the fittings     

184
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,295
to protect the threads from damage          

185
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,766
until they're ready to make all the necessary connections. 

186
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:38,570
it's taken about five hours to produce these air-brake tanks, 

187
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:42,307
and it's now time to put on the brakes.     

188
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,523
narrator: frosted cereal originated in america     

189
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,791
in the 1950s,         

190
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,726
and today, you'll find versions of it   

191
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,662
on breakfast tables around the world.       

192
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,130
it's one of the first things  

193
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,798
some people reach for in the morning.        

194
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,935
the sugary coating complements the flavor of the grains.   

195
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:14,273
it's one way to awaken the taste buds.   

196
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,811
this particular blend of frosted cereal       

197
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,748
is a combination of wheat flakes, corn flakes, 

198
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,816
and granola clusters.     

199
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,752
half the flakes are frosted, and half aren't.        

200
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,756
there's honey, rolled oats, and rice in the granola.    

201
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,156
the mix of the ingredients means

202
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:37,029
there are still a few surprises
in the frosted-cereal box.   

203
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,766
to make the corn flakes, they start with corn grits.  

204
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,501
they measure out a specific amount       

205
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,636
and release it into an industrial version   

206
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,506
of a pressure cooker.     

207
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,840
the operator locks the lid,  

208
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,576
and the system pipes water and flavorings         

209
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,178
directly into the cooker.   

210
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,715
it rotates for an even distribution of heat  

211
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,584
and an even cooking of the grains.         

212
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,720
after about three hours,    

213
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,989
the kernels have absorbed moisture and softened.     

214
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,924
as the corn flows out of the cooker,       

215
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,795
a screw-conveyor system moves it towards a dryer.   

216
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:12,597
they cook a measured amount of whole-wheat kernels     

217
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,334
in water and flavorings.    

218
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:19,204
they only need an hour     
in the rotating pressure cooker.

219
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,739
like the corn, the whole wheat 

220
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,941
absorbs a significant amount of water during cooking.    

221
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,477
the kernels are about 30% moisture     

222
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,146
when they exit the cooker.   

223
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,883
they now merge with the corn en route to the dryer.     

224
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,818
the drying time will bring the moisture content      

225
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,821
down to about 19%,       

226
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,823
making the kernels the right consistency     

227
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:41,559
to be transformed into flakes. 

228
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,197
the grains now flow into a mill.

229
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,701
the mill has two big, heavy rollers,  

230
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,504
similar to the kind used to pave roads.         

231
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,839
the kernels fall between these rollers.     

232
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,841
the rollers exert tons of pressure     

233
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,646
to flatten each individual kernel into a flake.      

234
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,517
in the process, the wheat flakes turn whiter  

235
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,386
and the corn turn more yellow. 

236
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,522
at this point, the flakes are still quite soft      

237
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,592
and not really tasty.     

238
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,127
a trip through a long toaster oven  

239
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,865
will give it that crispy cereal consistency.

240
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,734
it's a high-temperature toasting

241
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:26,538
and reduces the moisture content
to 3%.             

242
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,610
here, you can see the flakes before toasting...       

243
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,945
and after.           

244
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,549
the toasting not only makes the
corn and wheat flakes crispy --

245
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,818
it also enhances the color and flavor.     

246
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,755
a ride on a conveyor cools them down.        

247
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:48,493
along the way, they split into two different streams.  

248
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,961
one stream of the mixed flakes 

249
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,899
travel towards the sugar-coating station.   

250
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:57,636
the other heads into a flavoring drum.       

251
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:00,638
the drum revolves to gently toss the cereal   

252
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,443
as a sprayer applies a granola kind of flavoring.  

253
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,447
the other stream of wheat and corn flakes    

254
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,048
enters the sugar-coating drum. 

255
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,784
a sprayer disperses a sugar-and-water mixture   

256
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,854
as the drum tosses the flakes. 

257
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,256
then they travel through a dryer,        

258
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,858
and this cures the frosting to the flakes.         

259
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,462
the frosted and the flavored flakes    

260
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,197
flow onto the same conveyor.  

261
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,067
it bounces the flakes around to blend them together.    

262
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,139
to boost the nutrition content, 
they add honey-flavored granola.

263
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,010
the granola clusters flow onto a conveyor.     

264
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:43,548
they'll merge with the frosted and flavored flakes.      

265
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,786
the feeder pipe showers granola
onto the flakes.        

266
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:54,626
this frosted cereal is now ready
for store shelves.       

267
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:59,498
machinery dispenses specific amounts into a plastic sleeve, 

268
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,301
and a mechanism heat-seals and severs it at both ends.  

269
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,708
mechanical arms then pick up boxes, open them, 

270
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,278
and deposit them on a conveyor.

271
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,183
push rods shove the bags of cereal into the boxes.   

272
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,052
the "best before" date and other information      

273
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,523
have been printed on the outside of the boxes.  

274
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,125
nozzles apply glue to the ends,

275
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:32,063
and the boxes brush by a side barrier that closes them.   

276
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,733
producing and packaging this frosted-cereal blend   

277
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,734
has taken about five hours,  

278
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:40,205
and if the breakfast crowd is hungry, it won't last long. 

279
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:44,376
its time on the table could be short and sweet.   

280
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,860
narrator: a fossil is a remnant
of prehistoric life      

281
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,061
embedded in rock --      

282
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,864
either the actual remains of an animal or plant     

283
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,933
or an impression left by decayed remains.      

284
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,002
most fossils are hundreds of millions of years old    

285
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,939
and remind us that humans have been around  

286
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:18,276
for a small part of the earth's existence.   

287
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,746
fossils are made by nature   

288
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,015
but collected and preserved by man             

289
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:29,087
for display in museums, as well
as in private collections.   

290
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,822
one of the world's richest fossil deposits    

291
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,826
is located in the southwestern part of the state of wyoming.  

292
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,897
50 million years ago, the area was a freshwater lake.

293
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,900
with climate changes, it gradually dried out,    

294
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:45,837
leaving wildlife and flora   
buried under layers of sediment.

295
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,974
over time, that sediment hardened into sheets of rock  

296
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:54,111
containing fossils of those former life forms.  

297
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,514
to find fossils in what were the shallower edges      

298
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,182
of the prehistoric lake,    

299
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,985
they drive thin blades about 4/10 of an inch deep   

300
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,456
to loosen and separate sheets of rock.            

301
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,190
in this part of the deposit,  

302
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,060
the fossil is often split between two layers of rock,  

303
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,464
which is why they call this particular dig area    

304
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,799
"the split-fish quarry."    

305
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:19,737
they repeat the process, excavating several layers.   

306
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,072
they typically find fossils  

307
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:25,677
of smaller herring-type fish, plants, and insects.      

308
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,878
they carefully separate the large rock sheets     

309
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,481
into smaller pieces so that it's easier      

310
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,819
to transport their haul    
from the quarry to the workshop.

311
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,954
this sedimentary rock is oil shale --        

312
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,890
a substitute for conventional crude oil.  

313
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,828
scratch the surface, and it smells, and it'll burn. 

314
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,365
however, there's not enough actual oil in this deposit   

315
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,835
to make extraction viable.   

316
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,303
in the company's second quarry,

317
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:56,908
they blow away surface debris to
make it easier to spot fossils. 

318
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,912
recovery is more difficult here 
because this part of the deposit

319
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,582
was the deep center of the prehistoric lake.    

320
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,452
wildlife was buried under far more sediment.    

321
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,988
it takes a highly trained eye 

322
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,590
and the low angle of morning sunlight      

323
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,858
to see the slight shadow    

324
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,795
which a fossil's ridges cast on the ground.      

325
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:18,797
after outlining their find,  

326
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,933
they use a saw with a diamond blade to cut around it.    

327
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,268
they've removed the surrounding rock      

328
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,173
to be able to slide their thin blades underneath...

329
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,478
...then gently extract their treasure.        

330
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,012
this is a tricky procedure.  

331
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,016
one wrong move, and the fossil shatters.    

332
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:41,820
in the workshop, under five-times magnification 

333
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,623
and using a variety of sharpened tools,      

334
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,958
they carefully scrape away the surface          

335
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,829
until the dark color of the fossil shows through.  

336
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,964
to fully reveal a fossil this size       

337
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:59,304
takes 30 to 40 hours of tedious and meticulous work.

338
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,643
as for the rock sheets from the split quarry,     

339
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,976
they saw the fossils apart,  

340
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,248
neatly framing each one within a rectangle.      

341
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,989
layers flake off more easily from split-quarry rock     

342
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,360
than from the harder rock of the other quarry.      

343
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,534
once a fossil is completely exposed,     

344
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,936
they seal and protect the surface          

345
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,406
with a light coat of spray-on acrylic.      

346
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,945
when exposing a fossil, it's critical         

347
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:45,483
to keep sharpening the tools on a diamond file,       

348
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,951
and, for visibility,      

349
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:51,089
to repeatedly clean the work  
surface with an eraser or brush.

350
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,765
how many layers of rock    
have to be scratched off varies.

351
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,768
a fossil can be sitting right on the surface      

352
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:09,207
or be buried a fraction of an inch or so beneath it.  

353
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,912
this freshwater stingray, a rare find,          

354
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:19,017
is about as intricate as a fossil gets.       

355
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:26,024
this fellow took more than a month to prepare. 

356
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,729
the detail of this large palm-leaf fossil is astounding.

357
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:35,466
you can actually see insect bites.         

358
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,204
and as this leaf fossilized on the prehistoric lake bed,  

359
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,805
so did the fish swimming around it,      

360
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,474
producing an incredible stone snapshot         

361
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:48,046
of life 50 million years ago.
