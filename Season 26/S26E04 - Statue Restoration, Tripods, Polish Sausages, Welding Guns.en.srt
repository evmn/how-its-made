00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,319
           narrator:            
   people have been crafting    

3
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,388
 religious statues for years.   

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,860
    but time can take a toll    
 on these sacred works of art.  

5
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:04,063
    that's where restoration    
             experts            
           come in.             

6
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,733
    these professionals work    
    small miracles to return    
            statues             

7
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,635
    to their former glory.      

8
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,408
   this is a wooden sculpture   
   of the christian messiah.    

9
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,144
   it was originally crafted    
     in the 15th century.       

10
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:21,147
    but today, it's riddled     
   with termites and broken.    

11
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,417
      a major restoration       
    has been its salvation.     

12
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,286
now, this historic work of art  

13
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:32,691
    is once again on display    
     in an italian church.      

14
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,295
    like the messiah statue,    
   this 18th century madonna    

15
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,897
          is damaged.           

16
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,966
          the plaster           
    on her face is chipped.     

17
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:45,438
    her fingers are broken,     
 and her robes are crumbling.   

18
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:52,044
   first, the restorer dusts    
 off some of the surface dirt.  

19
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,715
     he uses a soft brush       

20
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:58,818
      and gentle movements      
 to avoid further destruction.  

21
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:06,525
       then, he prepares        
     a cleaning solution.       

22
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:11,931
      he mixes a low-acid,      
 perfume-free soap with water.  

23
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,568
   he uses mild soap because    
  it's gentle on old plaster.   

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,273
    he heats up the mixture     
       to melt the soap.        

25
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,509
    then, he starts cleaning    
          the statue.           

26
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,716
    he applies the cleanser     
    to the madonna's face and   
             body.              

27
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:36,889
    he lets it soak into the    
             plaster            
     for 7 to 15 minutes.       

28
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,892
    he makes sure the statue    
 doesn't absorb too much water  

29
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,962
    because that would cause    
      more deterioration.       

30
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,766
      next, the restorer        

31
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,037
        wipes the statue        
 down with a damp sea sponge.   

32
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:56,275
       centuries of dirt        
      and grime come off.       

33
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,683
      for serious stains,       
     he combines alcohol and    
            ammonia.            

34
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,190
    he applies the cleansing    
             mixture            
     using a cotton swab.       

35
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:18,064
     he lightly scrubs off      
       the deep stains.         

36
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,870
 the alcohol evaporates quickly 
  so it's not on the surface    

37
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,741
   of the statue long enough    
    to do any more damage.      

38
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,578
     this madonna statue is     
            starting            
  to look like her old self.    

39
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,016
 the restorer uses rabbit glue  
      for the next step.        

40
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,152
         it's a strong          
     and flexible adhesive      

41
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:43,155
   that won't chip or crack.    

42
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,591
     he dissolves some glue     
      in distilled water.       

43
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,628
  he applies it to the cloth    

44
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,331
       exposed underneath       
      the broken plaster.       

45
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,170
    then, he mixes a special    
            plaster             

46
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,673
          called gesso          
     with the rabbit glue.      

47
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:09,515
       the mixture is 80%       
     plaster and 20% glue.      

48
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:12,584
  he dabs the plaster mixture   
    onto the glued sections     

49
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,321
      to fill in the gaps       
    in the madonna's robes.     

50
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,862
  he repairs her chipped nose   
    using a thicker version     

51
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,663
   of the plaster solution.     

52
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,199
         he applies it          
     with a small spatula.      

53
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,538
     after the first coat of    
             plaster            
      on the robes dries,       

54
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,742
          the restorer          
  adds another thicker coat.    

55
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,479
  he adds more layers until he  
               has              
 enough material to work with.  

56
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,615
        then, he sculpts        
      the robe's contours       

57
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,350
   using a surgical scalpel.    

58
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,353
      he blends the repair      
   into the original plaster    

59
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:51,624
          and sands it          
   until it looks seamless.     

60
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:57,296
   he mixes water-based paint   
 to match the original colors.  

61
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,965
       then, he carefully       
 covers the repaired sections,  

62
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,067
blending the old with the new.  

63
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,272
      he mends the brocade      
     by pressing gold leaf      

64
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,709
 onto the border of the robes.  

65
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,178
      the gold leaf sticks      
 to the glue applied earlier,   

66
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,314
matching the original pattern.  

67
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:25,257
       he seals the paint       
      with carnuba wax --       

68
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,259
      it gives the surface      
         of the statue          

69
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,562
 a hard and resilient finish.   

70
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:40,105
   it can take up to 4 months   
 to restore a damaged statue.   

71
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,274
          a sculpture           
 that's hundreds of years old   

72
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,210
        can look as good        
 as new in just a few months.   

73
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,848
 then, churchgoers can enjoy it 
    for centuries to come.      

74
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,234
   narrator: humans have been   
  making three-legged objects   

75
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,569
    for thousands of years.     

76
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,838
   the third leg gives these    
  structures extra stability.   

77
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,441
      some of the earliest      
          photographs           

78
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,644
           were taken           
     with cameras mounted on    
            tripods.            

79
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,312
      in fact, the tripod       

80
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,715
    has been called the most    
     important photographic     
           accessory            

81
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,051
        ever invented.          

82
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,053
    early tripods were made     
         out of wood.           

83
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,189
       they were heavy and      
          cumbersome.           

84
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,258
   their design and materials   
    have improved over time     

85
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,860
       to meet the needs        
       of both hobbyists        

86
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,795
   and professionals alike.     

87
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,398
    today's state-of-the-art    
             tripod             
        is lightweight,         

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,268
    collapsible and equipped    
  with precision adjustments.   

89
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,070
 contemporary tripods are made  

90
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,139
 from aluminum tubes that have  
   four different diameters.    

91
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,343
  the tubes are electrowelded   
  and anodized for precision,   

92
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,278
   hardness and durability.     

93
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,882
    a machine cuts the tubes    
   to the required lengths.     

94
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,550
    a press expands one end     

95
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,421
 of the d-shaped tubes to keep  
    the smaller diameters in    
             place.             

96
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,494
      here are two of the       
    different-sized diameter    
             tubes.             

97
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,497
    a worker inserts a tube     
      into this machine.        

98
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,366
it uses a high-precision laser  

99
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:18,637
   to etch the company's name   
      into the aluminum.        

100
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,908
       the laser process        
    turns the etched aluminum   
             white.             

101
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,511
  they coat aluminum castings   
     with powdered paint.       

102
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:29,247
      the casting is part       
     of a component called a    
            spider.             

103
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,318
it connects the tripod's legs.  

104
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,222
  once painted, the components  
  are taken to a cnc machine.   

105
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,791
      the machine shapes        

106
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,162
  the parts to the designer's   
     exact specifications.      

107
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,135
   a worker puts foam sleeves   
     called leg warmers on      

108
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,938
    two of the tripod's three   
             legs.              

109
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,808
        the sleeves allow       
          photographers         
   to easily handle the legs    

110
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,209
   in extreme temperatures.     

111
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,080
 the worker uses a pressurized  
air device to open the sleeve,  

112
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,116
   then she inserts the leg.    

113
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,689
 she uses a specialized machine 
  to add the top hinge collar   

114
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,324
   to the upper leg section.    

115
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,962
    the parts were designed     
       to work together         

116
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,298
 and click neatly into place.   

117
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:26,571
       next, she applies        
     the locking collars.       

118
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,673
      when a photographer       
       adjusts the legs,        

119
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,444
      the locking collars       
   will hold them in place.     

120
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,779
       she threads a bolt       
    through the collar ends     

121
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,916
 and adds a quick-release lever 
       to the assembly.         

122
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,920
       then, she fastens        
 all the components in place.   

123
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,056
           the levers           
  are ergonomically designed    

124
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,125
   and can be opened with one   
             hand.              

125
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,464
    she presses bushings into   
              place             
      on the upper collar       

126
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,866
 to complete the leg assembly.  

127
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:59,737
        now, the tripod         
 is ready for the next phase.   

128
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:04,543
 but first, the worker performs 
a quick quality control check.  

129
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,813
 she makes sure the legs slide  
     in and out correctly.      

130
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,549
        then, she checks        
     the locking collars.       

131
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:15,821
   next, she brings the legs    
 together to form the tripod.   

132
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:18,423
    she positions the bottom    
    of the spider component     

133
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:22,160
    on a specially-designed     
      support mechanism.        

134
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:26,030
 she installs the legs and caps 
    them with the top of the    
            spider,             

135
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,600
   then she bolts everything    
           in place.            

136
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:35,707
         next, a worker         
  assembles the tripod head.    

137
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,375
      this state-of-the-art     
           component            

138
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,079
        can be adjusted         
     in three directions.       

139
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:45,651
    she places plastic rings    
 between the three main parts   

140
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,921
        to ensure smooth        
   and accurate adjustments.    

141
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,727
 she installs leveling bubbles  
     to help photographers      

142
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,864
      accurately position       
        their cameras.          

143
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:02,667
    she adds the upper plate    
   and the adjustment knobs.    

144
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,602
        the plate screws        
       into the camera,         

145
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,540
       which conveniently       
    mounts onto the tripod.     

146
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,678
     the knobs also adjust      
      for easy storage and      
           transport.           

147
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:21,219
 she labels a knob to indicate  
      the scale of friction     
           intensity.           

148
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,022
      once the entire head      
     assembly is complete,      

149
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,326
 a worker carefully threads it  
    onto the tripod column.     

150
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,364
         the final step         
    in the assembly process     

151
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,033
   is to slide the column and   
              head              
  down through the spreader.    

152
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,371
   a worker checks to ensure    

153
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,640
         the mechanism          
     is working correctly,      

154
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,775
    then tightens the locking   
             knob.              

155
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,180
      the finished tripod       
        is lightweight,         

156
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,450
     compact and durable.       

157
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,785
      this tripod is ideal      
    for both professionals      

158
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,788
        and hobbyists.          

159
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,057
     it'll keep the camera      
       steady for anyone        

160
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,526
 who wants to take portraits,   

161
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,795
      profile architectural     
           features,            

162
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,332
           or capture           
     panoramic landscapes.      

163
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,218
 narrator: polish sausage isn't 
  necessarily made in poland.   

164
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,687
     also called kielbasa,      

165
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,423
       the term refers to       
     the style of sausage       

166
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,158
   rather than its location.    

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,961
       it's usually made        
       entirely of pork,        

168
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,162
  or a mix of pork and veal.    

169
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,568
      the meat is seasoned      
with salt, pepper, and garlic.  

170
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,971
         these sausages         
   might be made in canada,     

171
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,306
but there as polish as warsaw.  

172
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,508
  this kielbasa is 100% pork,   

173
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,244
    traditionally seasoned      

174
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:55,180
           and cooked           
   by natural wood smoking.     

175
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,116
       this company uses        
       the hind leg meat        

176
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,719
         leftover from          
      the hams they sell.       

177
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,187
      each sausage recipe       

178
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,691
  calls for specific portions   
of lean, medium, and fat meat.  

179
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,928
          workers fill          
   three separate meat carts    

180
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,397
   with the required quantity   
           of each.             

181
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,001
    they grind the contents     
   of each cart separately.     

182
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,870
    the three types of meat     
are ground to different sizes.  

183
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,872
         the lean meat          
     will be the largest,       

184
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,476
        and the fat meat        
     will be the smallest.      

185
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,144
 the small chunks of fat meat   

186
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,214
       will fill the gaps       
     between the large, lean    
            chunks.             

187
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,616
      they also add whole       
 garlic cloves to the grinder   

188
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,087
      with the fat meat.        

189
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,424
 then, they prepare a spice mix 
 that includes garlic powder,   

190
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,426
         white pepper,          

191
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,564
     coarsely-ground white,     
  red, and black peppercorns,   

192
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:49,968
    and a proprietary blend     
  of dried herbs and spices.    

193
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,971
  they also add pickling salt   
      as a preservative.        

194
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,142
     they blend the spices,     
    pork, and cold water in a   
             mixer.             

195
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:02,380
   the mixer also vacuums air   
       out of the meat.         

196
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,583
    this helps the seasoning    
 thoroughly saturate the pork.  

197
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:10,455
    it also makes the sausage   
             denser             
 and concentrates the flavor.   

198
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,791
    they mix the ingredients    
        for 15 minutes,         

199
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,194
        then let it rest        
    and marinate for several    
             hours.             

200
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,595
       after marinating,        

201
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,133
  the meat is ready to be put   
     into sausage casings.      

202
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,469
       the casing is made       
     out of hog intestine.      

203
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,139
     the filling specialist     
    controls the fill speed     

204
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,608
  with a knee-operated lever.   

205
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,410
  he applies the right amount   
 of pressure with his fingers   

206
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,080
  to stuff the fragile casing   
      without tearing it.       

207
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,218
     no two hog intestines      
        are identical,          

208
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,688
        so this process         
      can't be automated.       

209
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,223
    the filling specialist      

210
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,060
  constantly adjusts the speed  
   and pressure as he works.    

211
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,431
     the filling specialist     
   takes the finished casing    

212
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,769
      and gently loops it       
         over his arm.          

213
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,637
    then, he puts the loops     

214
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,040
         on the rack of         
     a smokehouse trolley.      

215
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,842
    a fully-loaded trolley      

216
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,512
     holds about 550 pounds     
       of raw sausages.         

217
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,385
     they roll the trolley      
 into the smokehouse chamber,   

218
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:20,926
        shut the door...        
      and light the fire.       

219
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,794
   they feed maple and hickory  
              logs              

220
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:28,065
     into a 10-foot fire pit    
             located            
  directly below the chamber.   

221
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,468
   they monitor each sausage    
      while it's smoking        

222
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,205
  and adjust the heat exposure  
          as needed.            

223
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,508
       the smoking period       
    lasts for 6 to 8 hours.     

224
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,346
         the meat cooks         
     at about 160 degrees       

225
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,482
 to kill off all the bacteria.  

226
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,352
      the smoke infuses it      
    with additional flavor,     

227
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,888
naturally curing the sausages.  

228
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,693
       after the sausages       
     leave the smokehouse,      

229
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,029
    they're cleaned with hot    
             water.             

230
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,498
       then, the sausages       
   are rinsed in cold water     

231
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,667
  and sent to a blast fridge.   

232
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,841
   this minimizes the amount    
            of time             

233
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:14,112
  the sausages are warm enough  
     for bacteria to grow.      

234
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,314
  the rapid cooling procedure   
      eliminates the need       

235
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,750
    for additional chemical     
        preservatives.          

236
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,890
   a worker cuts the sausage    
  into 4 1/2-pound portions.    

237
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,693
    he places each portion      

238
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:32,063
       in the bottom tray       
    of the plastic package.     

239
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,800
    before sealing the tray,    
  a machine sucks out the air   

240
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,670
   and replaces it with a mix   
        of 80% nitrogen         

241
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,474
    and 20% carbon dioxide.     

242
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,209
    this extends shelf life     

243
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,679
     because mold and yeast     
  can't live without oxygen.    

244
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:53,084
       the carbon dioxide       
     also inhibits bacterial    
            growth.             

245
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,952
the nitrogen fills the package  

246
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,556
     to protect the sausage     
       during transport.        

247
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,896
      every sealed package      
     passes through a metal     
           detector.            

248
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,966
   then, a scale weighs each    
package and prints out a label  

249
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,268
     indicating the weight      
     and the sell-by date.      

250
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,173
   a sealed and refrigerated    
      package of sausage        

251
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,510
         can stay fresh         
      for up to 35 days.        

252
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,579
  once opened, these sausages   
          taste best            

253
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,782
   if eaten within 7 days --    

254
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:28,153
        and even better         
   with a little sauerkraut.    

255
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:45,070
   welding guns are regulars    
      on "how it's made."       

256
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,538
they're used in many factories  

257
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,940
      all over the world.       

258
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,476
   they have copper claws that  
              hold              
    parts together with high    
             force,             

259
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,013
   then weld items together.    

260
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,717
  the guns are designed to do   
   precision work at a steady   
             pace.              

261
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,558
   a welding gun is designed    
     to make the same weld      

262
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,059
     over and over again.       

263
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,164
       they're programmed       
   to accomplish a repetitive   
              task              

264
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,267
    with pinpoint accuracy.     

265
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,838
       production starts        
with the gun's electrode caps,  

266
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,373
         which are made         
      out of copper rod.        

267
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,576
        the rod uncoils         
    and travels to a forming    
            machine             

268
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:29,581
    with a series of punches    
           and dies.            

269
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,418
   mechanical fingers move the  
               rod              
   from one die to the next.    

270
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,524
   the punches drive the rod    
     into the die cavities      

271
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,060
   to shape it into electrode   
             caps.              

272
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,198
     the electrodes come in     
            thousands           
      of different shapes       

273
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,001
          and are made          
    it many different ways.     

274
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,803
   the make this electrode,     

275
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:56,007
 automated tools taper a thick  
    copper rod at one end.      

276
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,944
 then, a drill bores a hole in  
    the other end for cooling   
             water.             

277
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,815
  smaller electrodes are made   
 of partially-hollowed blanks.  

278
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,952
   they shave down the blank    

279
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,889
    so that it will be able     
    to weld in small areas.     

280
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,358
      they also shape it        

281
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,761
   so that the electrode cap    
       will fit on top.         

282
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,432
 they use another drill to make 
an entrance for cooling water.  

283
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,167
 the entrance intersects with   

284
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,902
       the hollowed part        
       of the cylinder.         

285
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,704
     then, another machine      

286
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,174
    bends the electrode into    
       its final shape.         

287
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,778
             next,              
 they make the shunt adapter.   

288
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,048
   a worker uses a hydraulic    
 machine to bend a copper bar   

289
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,817
         around a die.          

290
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,391
   he measures it to confirm    
     that the dimensions are    
            correct.            

291
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,397
    a high-pressure water jet   
             carves             
 through a thick copper plate   

292
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,600
  to create the welding arms.   

293
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,071
         the water jet          
can precisely cut out the part  

294
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,207
 without scorching the copper.  

295
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,746
     at the next station,       

296
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:11,016
   computerized tools shape a   
              solid             
  block of steel into a mount   

297
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:12,884
    for the welding machine's   
             motor.             

298
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,392
       it's a substantial       
        transformation.         

299
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,563
 an employee bolts steel plates 
 to the end of the copper arm.  

300
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,701
       he places a washer       
        over the plates         

301
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:33,437
 and then tightens the bolts.   

302
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,441
    he inserts the electrode    
 in the other end of the arm.   

303
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,744
    then, he places the cap     
  on and hammers it in place.   

304
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:48,119
   the worker uses a crane to   
              move              
    the second weld arm into    
             place.             

305
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,654
      he aligns the holes       

306
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,724
       and joins the arms       
 with the temporary metal pin.  

307
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:56,127
    the transformer delivers    
electricity to the electrodes.  

308
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:02,666
  a worker attaches the robot   
      welding arms to it.       

309
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,003
 he replaces the temporary pin  
     with a permanent one.      

310
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:10,475
    then, he bolts the arms     
      to the transformer.       

311
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,244
      now, the welding gun      
    is ready for the motor.     

312
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,282
he joins the motor to the arms  

313
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,919
     and tightens the bolts     
         on each side.          

314
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:29,226
  the mechanics of this robot   
   welding gun are complete.    

315
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,262
      now they need to add      
         the plumbing.          

316
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,433
    an employee cuts plastic    
             tubing             

317
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,469
        and connects it         
      to the welding gun.       

318
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:44,509
     the tubes will supply a    
            constant            
   flow of water to the gun.    

319
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,577
          without it,           
    the gun would overheat      

320
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,980
     and the electrode tips     
          could melt.           

321
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,852
 he bundles some of the hoses   

322
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,621
     and ties them together     
   for neater installation.     

323
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,326
        they test every         
       robot welding gun        

324
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,463
      to confirm that it's      
      fully operational.        

325
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,465
     this gun is a slightly     
           different            

326
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,068
      version that the one      
   that was just assembled.     

327
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,140
      the technician also       
    confirms that the tips      

328
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,541
     have sufficient force      
       for a good weld.         

329
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,745
         too much force         
    could damage the tips.      

330
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,883
        too little force        
 would result in a poor weld.   

331
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,855
     it takes about an hour     
   to assemble a robot welding  
              gun.              

332
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,895
       this gun is ready        
     to leave the factory       

333
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,131
   and be part of the action    
        at another one.
