   seems to originate in haiti  

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,923

15
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,620
    increasingly popular both   
     in thailand and abroad.    

16
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,658
     workers start by adding    
        the raw materials       

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,060
to a mixer, beginning with clay.

18
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:41,433
    they add a fiber derived    
   from ground-up rice husks.   

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,702
 this fiber reinforces the clay,

20
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,437
    giving it added strength    

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,573
     and helping to prevent     
      the finished product      

22
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,476
          from cracking         
      at high temperatures.     

23
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,113
the correct mixture is two parts
     clay to one part husk.     

24
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,485
    once the mixer thoroughly   
      blends the materials,     

25
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,989
    it extrudes the resulting   
   compound in a thick ribbon,  

26
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,592
       ready for the next       
      phase of production.      

27
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,894
     a worker rolls the clay    
       in a small quantity      

28
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,666
       of a third material      
     also derived from rice.    

29
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:15,900
     this is rice husk ash.     

30
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,971
    and adding it to the clay   
   helps prevent mold growth.   

31
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,442
       a craftsman places       
         the clay inside        

32
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,311
    a specially shaped mold,    

33
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,615
 which sits on a potter's wheel.

34
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,417
  as the wheel turns the mold,  

35
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,551
       the craftsman works      
        with a metal arm        

36
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,521
  and handheld tools to spread  

37
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:38,057
       and shape the clay.      

38
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:45,264
         he then removes        
   the fully formed clay pot.   

39
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,098
        having marked out       
         three locations        

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,500
     on the rim of the pot,     

41
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,670
 a craftsman now adds some husk 
     ask to a handheld mold     

42
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,306
      to prevent sticking.      

43
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,576
he then packs the mold with clay

44
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,544
       before pressing it       
       into the pot's rim       

45
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,613
       and inner surface.       

46
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,849
      he smoothes the clay      
          around them,          

47
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,486
 integrating them into the pot. 

48
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,155
      these three elements      
    will form raised supports   

49
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,325
        for cooking pots,       
        woks and kettles.       

50
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,897
     at this stage, the pot     
      has air dried enough      

51
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,233
       to safely remove it      
         from the mold.         

52
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,572
     the craftsman now uses     
    a handheld tool to define   

53
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,076
      and finish the edges      
    of the rim and supports.    

54
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,282
      he then uses a metal,     
  rectangular template to mark  

55
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:41,487
and cut out a small vent for air
 intake at the base of the pot. 

56
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,992
       an artisan prepares      
      a small disk of clay      

57
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,596
      for a different stage     
         of production.         

58
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,532
he uses a cylindrical metal tool

59
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,701
         to cut a series        
    of 62 holes in the disk,    

60
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,370
  creating a honeycomb pattern  

61
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,572
         that will allow        
       the passage of air.      

62
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,641
         he uses a small        
       beveled wooden tool      

63
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,544
         to help smooth         
     the edges of the holes.    

64
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,512
          when the pots         
        are fully formed,       

65
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,115
      workers transfer them     
      to the walk-in oven.      

66
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,384

       a total of 500 pots      

67
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,086
     and honeycombs inside,     

68
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,088
 it's time to fire up the oven. 

69
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,323
     the pots spend 8 hours     

70
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:23,328
      in the oven at nearly     
    2,200 degrees fahrenheit.   

71
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,000
    the firing process gives    
 the gray clay a reddish tinge. 

72
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,069
   to assemble the barbecues,   

73
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,939
   a worker starts by creating  
      a layer of rice husk      

74
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,943
      between the clay pot      
      and the zinc bucket.      

75
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,813
    this insulates the metal    
    from the barbecue's heat.   

76
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,150
he cuts out the rectangular vent

77
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,252
       that will allow air      
     to flow into the bottom    

78
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,456
         of the barbecue        
     and help fuel the fire.    

79
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,328
     he adds soil to the gap    
         between the pot        

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,997
    and the bucket to further   
      insulate the exterior     

81
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,966
  metal from the interior heat. 

82
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,072
     the craftsman now seals    
  all the gaps in the barbecue  

83
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,407
      with mortar in order      

84
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,544
        to keep the husk        
    and soil firmly in place.   

85
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,217
       the honeycomb disk       
         fits perfectly         

86
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,186
   into the bottom of the pot.  

87
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,721
    it will hold charcoal up    
      above the vent hole,      

88
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,290
     allowing air to flow up    
           through it,          

89
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,626

    running down its length.    

107
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,188

        it from the mold.       

126
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,541
       as the robot lifts       
  the blade out of the machine, 

127
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,977
      the mold closes again     

128
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,477
  to receive another injection  

129
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,280
     to make the next blade.    

130
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:34,353
       the robot deposits       
 the blade onto a conveyer belt 

131
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,324
       which transports it      
   through a cold-air tunnel.   

132
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,096
           this cools           
    the thermoplastic enough    

133
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,499
     to enable the upcoming     
       component materials      

134
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,902
to properly adhere to the blade.

135
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,406
     the next robot picks up    
        the cooled blade        

136
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,210
     and moves it to another    
   injection molding machine,   

137
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,579
 which performs a process known 
        as over printing,       

138
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,350
   molding on additional parts  
   until the fin is completed.  

139
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,894
         the robot first        
      removes the previous      

140
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,562
     completed fin fresh out    

141
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:21,299
           of the over          
    printing injection mold.    

142
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,368
       this machine melted      
          down granules         

143
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,937
    of thermoplastic rubber,    

144
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,038
    a more flexible material,   

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,075
  and simultaneously injection  
      molded the side arms      

146
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,144
       and the foot pocket      
         onto the blade.        

147
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,816
    once the robot pulls off    
       this completed fin,      

148
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,385
     it loads the new blade     
         into the mold.         

149
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,225
       as the mold closes       
     for the next injection,    

150
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:51,997
 the robot deposits the finished
    fin into a conveyer belt.   

151
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,833
        the over printing       
      process also applied      

152
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,368
     the manufacturer's name    

153
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,604
  and some decorative elements. 

154
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,507
      by changing the molds     
    on the injection machines   

155
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,142
       and using different      
        types and colors        

156
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,943
   of thermoplastic materials,  

157
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:10,182
      the factory produces      
   a wide range of fin models.  

158
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:14,152
    a diving mask is made up    

159
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,055
     of a flexible silicone     
      facial skirt attached     

160
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,025
        to a rigid frame        
          with lenses.          

161
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,328
 the skirt, which this injection

162
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,963
    molding machine produces    
      from liquid silicone,     

163
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,567
  seals the frame to the face,  

164
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,102
 preventing water infiltration. 

165
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,606
   while thermoplastic must be  
    melted before injection,    

166
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,574
         then cooled to         
         a solid state,         

167
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,110
        silicone must be        
        injected combined       

168
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,412
     with a hardening agent     

169
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,882
  then heated to a solid state. 

170
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:47,486
        the frame is made       
    the same way as the fins    

171
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:51,723
     but using a more rigid     
     type of thermoplastic.     

172
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,791
         a worker begins        
       assembling the mask      

173
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,794
          by threading          
      a silicone head strap     

174
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,497
  through the frame's buckles.  

175
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,932
 they attach the silicone skirt,

176
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:05,070
 first pressing the nose portion
  into the bridge of the frame. 

177
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,606
         then the worker        
     connects the eye area.     

178
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,408
      the frame is designed     
  to enable the silicone skirt  

179
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,844
        to slot right in.       

180
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:17,416
   next, the lenses, which are  
     made of tempered glass.    

181
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,984
 while they're highly resistant,

182
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,520
      they don't withstand      
         frontal impact.        

183
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:25,624
  so the diver shouldn't plunge 
   into the water face first.   

184
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,959
         the final step         
          is to clip in         

185
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,562
       rigid thermoplastic      
         lens retainers         

186
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:35,433
   and clamp each one securely  
     to the lens and frame.     

187
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,970
      the mask is now ready     
     for a final inspection     

188
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,007
 to make sure no water will seep
      in when you wear it.      

189
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,342
         just like fins,        

190
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,179
      there's a wide range      
      of diving mask models     

191
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,447
         designed to see        
        through different       

192
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,017
types of underwater exploration.
