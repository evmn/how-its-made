00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,157
narrator: today on "how it's made"...       

2
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,693
ceramic tiles...        

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,565
nuts...            

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,338
steel forgings...       

5
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,910
and skateboards.        

6
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:56,188
ceramic tiles are a popular choice for flooring, 

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,390
kitchen backsplashes, and bathroom walls.      

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,595
they can withstand humidity and
won't absorb liquids or odors. 

9
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,198
they're also fireproof, fade-resistant,        

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,665
and stain-resistant.      

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,634
and no matter how much you walk on them,       

12
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,204
ceramic tiles never wear out. 

13
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,077
this factory specializes in wall tiles.         

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,545
floor tiles are made using the same process        

15
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,648
but with different materials. 

16
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:29,955
the starting material here is 
talc -- a soft, powdery mineral.

17
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,891
they blend it with four different powdered chemicals, 

18
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,627
the names of which are a company secret.     

19
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,797
the ingredients go into a mixer,

20
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,237
where they're hydrated until they're 6% water to 94% powder.

21
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,440
the mixer runs for precisely 12 minutes.   

22
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,443
any longer would heat the mixture and dry it out.  

23
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,917
the mixture is now slightly damp
and quite lumpy.        

24
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,386
a conveyor belt transports it to a grinder          

25
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,923
that mills it to a fine texture.

26
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,659
this mixture is now ready to be formed          

27
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,028
into various models of tiles. 

28
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,536
the factory uses fully automated machinery   

29
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,139
to produce its 1.6-square-inch tiles --  

30
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,608
a standard wall tile size.   

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,279
a moving tray first deposits a batch of mixture into a mold.

32
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,718
the mold's cavity is in the shape of six upside-down tiles.

33
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:40,092
a press descends,       
applying both heat and pressure.

34
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,627
this compacts the mixture into the cavity,        

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,530
solidifying the shape.     

36
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,433
as the press rises,      

37
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,703
the mold automatically pops out
the tiles.           

38
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,540
they roll off the machine onto a conveyor belt.     

39
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,179
the belt now flips the tiles right side up         

40
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,714
without breaking them --    

41
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,982
which is quite a feat,     

42
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,652
considering that these yet-to-be-baked tiles      

43
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,987
aren't fully hardened.     

44
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,189
the equipment is precision-adjusted       

45
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,960
to handle the tiles gently at all production phases.    

46
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,999
a revolving brush now sweeps the tiles clean.  

47
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,403
their surface must be free of dust and other contaminants 

48
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,004
for paint to adhere properly. 

49
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,808
the factory uses a water-based paint      

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,477
that's specifically designed for ceramics.         

51
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,080
it continually circulates in a vat,           

52
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,616
keeping the color well-blended.

53
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,819
the painting process resembles an automatic car wash.     

54
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,156
the tiles travel through four spray zones,   

55
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,758
each of which applies a thin coat of paint.     

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,428
then they pass         
under powerful heating elements,

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,230
which dry the paint in mere seconds.        

58
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,499
all that's left is to bake the tiles,     

59
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,368
which we'll see shortly.    

60
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,306
the factory uses the same ceramic mixture    

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,908
to produce these square border tiles.   

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,977
they look just like the other wall tiles,     

63
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,881
except that two of the sides are rounded.          

64
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,250
when you install a row of these border tiles      

65
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,851
above the regular tiles,    

66
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,855
the rounded edges produce a clean, finished look.    

67
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,326
while the factory uses the same painting process   

68
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,527
for border tiles,       

69
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,996
the molding process, as you just saw,        

70
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,531
is somewhat different.     

71
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,466
rather than being fully automated,        

72
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:33,405
it requires some manual labor 
due to the tiles' complex shape.

73
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,007
that's why border tiles are often more expensive    

74
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,743
than regular tiles.      

75
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,350
when the tiles come out of the dryer,       

76
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,319
workers stack them on wooden racks.        

77
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,957
they load the racks onto mobile carts       

78
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,363
and then roll the carts into a gas-powered oven called a kiln.

79
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,566
this factory's kiln is 190 feet long --      

80
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,102
longer than an olympic-size swimming pool 

81
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,939
and large enough to bake 50,000 wall tiles at once.   

82
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,312
the firing, as it's called, takes 14 hours.        

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,381
any sudden change in temperature

84
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,550
could produce thermal shock and crack the tiles,      

85
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,321
so the kiln starts out at 390 degrees fahrenheit,   

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,592
climbing gradually to a peak of 1,970 degrees,       

87
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,662
then descends slowly back to the starting temperature.  

88
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,732
after a cooling period that lasts roughly an hour,  

89
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,333
the tiles come out.      

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,601
they're now fully hardened   

91
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,838
and ready to have their back to the wall.          

92
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,216
narrator: scan the snack-food 
aisle of your local supermarket,

93
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,619
and you'll notice that barbecue,
ketchup, and salt-and-vinegar 

94
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,357
are no longer limited to potato chips.        

95
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,893
nuts come in tantalizing taste choices, too.

96
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,562
but if you're a traditionalist,

97
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:07,466
you can still buy them plain, salted, or unsalted.      

98
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,370
the botanical definition of a nut            

99
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,640
is a dry, one-seed fruit in a hard shell        

100
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,642
that doesn't open on its own. 

101
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,111
most peanuts have two seeds,  

102
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,847
so even though we call them nuts,       

103
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,916
they're technically a legume --
a type of pea.         

104
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,989
one way to prepare peanuts for sale is to roast them whole,  

105
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,391
right in their shells.     

106
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,326
this is known as dry-roasting 

107
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,195
because they cook the peanuts without using any oil     

108
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,532
in a large convection oven.  

109
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,468
the oven temperature is 300 degree fahrenheit.   

110
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,539
the roasting process takes about a half-hour.    

111
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,073
when the peanuts come out,   

112
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,344
they're fully cooked and ready to be eaten.     

113
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,351
before the peanuts go off to be packaged,     

114
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,685
a worker inspects them,    

115
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:04,256
removing any shell fragments and foreign matter.      

116
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,033
another way to prepare peanuts or other nuts for sale     

117
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,102
is to dry-roast only the seeds.

118
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,439
these peanut seeds arrive at the factory         

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,810
with their shells and skins already removed.        

120
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,714
a conveyor transports them   

121
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,417
to a revolving drum called the tumbler.      

122
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,988
as the tumbler spins,     

123
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,657
the nuts are sprayed      
with a liquid seasoning mixture,

124
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,128
one of 10 flavors this company produces --    

125
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,065
salted, smoked, ketchup, barbecue, and salt-and-vinegar,

126
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,067
just to name a few.      

127
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,935
the rotating action ensures  

128
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,538
the seasoning coats the nuts thoroughly.   

129
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,114
now a conveyor transports the peanuts to a convection oven. 

130
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,953
the conveyor turns from side to side,       

131
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,022
spreading the peanuts in a thin layer        

132
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,325
so that they'll dry-roast evenly.   

133
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,897
they roast for the same length of time  

134
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,967
and at the same temperature as peanuts in the shell --   

135
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,770
about a half-hour at 300 degrees fahrenheit.   

136
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:29,841
as they exit the oven, a worker breaks up any clumps. 

137
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,456
when they use the other method of preparing shelled nuts,   

138
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,926
they tumble on the seasoning after cooking.         

139
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,729
instead of dry-roasting the nuts, as we saw earlier,  

140
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,664
they fry them in oil.     

141
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,200
this process is called oil-roasting.         

142
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,471
it gives the nuts a greasier, fried taste.    

143
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,875
these cashews are on their way to be oil-roasted.       

144
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,143
they go into a huge frying tank

145
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,147
containing 580 gallons of canola oil         

146
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,651
heated to 320 degrees fahrenheit.    

147
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,555
the nuts come out fully cooked 15 minutes later,       

148
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,490
and they're steaming hot.   

149
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,227
a powerful ventilation system draws the heat outdoors,    

150
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,097
cooling the cashews to room temperature.      

151
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,434
this process takes about 15 minutes.        

152
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,704
by now, the nuts have absorbed any cooking oil        

153
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,573
that remained on their surface,

154
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,842
so they receive a light spray of vegetable oil.       

155
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,245
this makes their surface sticky again   

156
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,481
so that the salt or seasoning mix will adhere. 

157
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,360
this factory also produces nut mixes.    

158
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,967
here the mixer is combining various nuts with dried fruit. 

159
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,471
from there it's on to a packaging machine,

160
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:10,008
whose eight computer-programmed
scales automatically weigh out 

161
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,477
a specific package portion.  

162
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,347
but before each portion goes into a bag,        

163
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,750
it passes through a metal detector.       

164
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,152
this ensures that no shards of metal    

165
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,757
have worn off the equipment and fallen into the food.   

166
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,494
the machinery hermetically seals
the plastic packages.     

167
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:33,365
this keeps the contents fresh for at least six months.    

168
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,177
narrator: when does forging not involve fraud?       

169
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,379
when you're talking about metal.

170
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,315
many industrial machines contain
steel parts          

171
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,984
that have to withstand great stress.         

172
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,520
the metalworking method    

173
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,856
that produces the strongest steel parts is forging --   

174
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,125
heating the metal,       

175
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,361
then forming it to the required
size and shape.        

176
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,471
steel forgings are made from scrap iron --       

177
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,673
pieces of used iron recovered 

178
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,210
from demolished buildings and old cars --        

179
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,012
as well as bits of new iron  

180
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,182
left over from the manufacture of iron products.       

181
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,354
forge workers maneuver a gigantic magnet       

182
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,956
to lift almost 6 tons of scrap at a time           

183
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,593
until they've filled a 28-ton scrap bucket.     

184
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,832
the bucket empties two such loads into a fiery furnace,  

185
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,837
whose temperature peaks at 3,000 degrees fahrenheit.  

186
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,506
this is called an electric arc furnace    

187
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,976
because the heat is created by a strong electric current  

188
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,845
running in an arc between three electrodes.   

189
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:59,317
there are about 20 main grades and 100 subgrades of steel.  

190
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,053
they're produced by adding specific metals   

191
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,988
or nonmetallic chemical elements,       

192
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,257
such as aluminum...      

193
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,526
nickel...           

194
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,594
chromium...          

195
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,664
vanadium...          

196
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,933
manganese...          

197
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,467
carbon...           

198
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,336
and molybdenum.        

199
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,472
they also add the mineral fluorite      

200
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,206
to help fuse the metals,    

201
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,144
some of which are in the form of blocks called ingots.    

202
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:29,747
throughout the 3 1/2-hour meltdown,           

203
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,085
they test and adjust the chemical composition.   

204
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,455
they try to attain the lowest hydrogen, oxygen,  

205
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,424
nitrogen, and sulfur levels -- 

206
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:44,162
the key to producing strong, high-quality steel.  

207
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,297
then they pour the sizzling molten metal   

208
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,001
into a 50-ton ladle that's lined
with heat-resistant brick.   

209
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,705
they add aluminum and lime   

210
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,174
to chemically counteract oxidation --          

211
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,910
rusting caused by air exposure.

212
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,513
now they cast an ingot --   

213
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,983
a block of steel that they'll shape into a forging. 

214
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,053
the molten metal flows out the bottom of the ladle  

215
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,055
into a mold below.       

216
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,191
this bottom pouring, as it's called,        

217
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,594
makes for a smoother casting because liquid flowing downward

218
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:21,399
doesn't swill around as much as liquid poured sideways.   

219
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:26,604
this forge can cast ingots weighing up to 46 tons.    

220
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:30,008
after several hours, the ingot solidifies,     

221
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,544
and they turn the mold upside down to extract it.   

222
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,413
then, over 12 hours,      

223
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,883
they reheat the ingot to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit.  

224
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,720
this makes it soft enough to hammer or press into shape. 

225
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,690
to make large forgings,    

226
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,092
they use a machine called a forging press,        

227
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,062
mounted inside a forming die or a pair of dies,       

228
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:55,032
depending on the technique they're using.         

229
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,236
the press applies thousands of tons of pressure,      

230
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,472
crushing the ingot and forcing it against the die.

231
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:09,113
the steel is quickly oxidizing with all this air exposure.  

232
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,048
they use a high-pressure water gun   

233
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,051
to remove the scales of rust. 

234
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,322
an ingot often passes through a die several times      

235
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,525
or through a series of dies arranged in sequence.     

236
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,096
each pressing forms the metal 
bit by bit into the final shape.

237
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,602
metal is composed of microscopic crystals.    

238
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,472
squeezing it in a press bends these crystals,     

239
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,541
destabilizing the metal structure.      

240
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,144
but reheating the metal creates new crystals      

241
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,013
to replace the deformed ones. 

242
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,148
this restabilizes the structure,         

243
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,817
and, because the new crystals are smaller,          

244
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,954
makes the metal stronger than before.          

245
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,157
that's why finished forgings require heat treatment     

246
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,626
in what's called an annealing furnace.     

247
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,764
they heat for a day or two,  
depending on the grade of steel.

248
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,232
then they soak in a water-and-chemical bath   

249
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,035
for about five hours.     

250
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,471
this strengthens the steel even more.           

251
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,975
finally, workers mount the steel forgings       

252
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,444
on lathes and milling machines.

253
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,979
they remove the rust scales  

254
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,081
that formed during heat treatment,     

255
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,117
then precision-machine the forgings          

256
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,651
into what the client ordered --

257
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:25,256
usually industrial parts such as
rotors, spindles, and shafts. 

258
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,592
many factories prefer to buy forgings     

259
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,660
in the shape of blocks or bars 

260
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,297
and machine the parts themselves.          

261
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,672
narrator: skateboarding may have
started out          

262
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,742
as a simple outdoor pastime, but in the last few decades,  

263
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,278
it's evolved into a popular thrill sport.  

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,547
professional skateboarders are known           

265
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,282
for performing spectacular aerial maneuvers,       

266
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,018
achieving speeds and heights  

267
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,188
the early skateboarders could never have imagined.   

268
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:07,898
in the 1930s, thrill-seeking kids began attaching      

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,168
their metal roller-skate wheels
to wooden crates.       

270
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,570
little did they know      

271
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,640
this would one day spawn a worldwide phenomenon.     

272
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,844
the boxes evolved to boards in 1958,            

273
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,914
when some california surfers invented sidewalk surfing --  

274
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,182
something to do        

275
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,718
when bad weather prevented them
from riding the waves.     

276
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,055
they attached roller-skate wheels to wooden planks,    

277
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,124
then coasted through the streets.          

278
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,859
pretty soon, the fad caught on 

279
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,796
in cities throughout the united states. 

280
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,206
the deck -- the part of the skateboard you stand on -- 

281
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,677
is made up of several thin   
sheets of wood called "veneers."

282
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,748
inexpensive boards use fewer  
sheets and lesser-quality woods.

283
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,884
these high-end boards use a full seven sheets    

284
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,553
of top-quality maple.     

285
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,491
only the top and bottom veneer sheets will actually show,   

286
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,159
so their exposed side is sanded smooth,       

287
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,396
and the other side gets a coat of glue.      

288
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,900
the inside sheets, meanwhile, go through the glue spreader, 

289
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,501
which saturates both sides.  

290
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,837
this adhesive is specially formulated    

291
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,507
to withstand vibration and shock.           

292
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,376
workers stack 35 sheets of veneer --          

293
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,045
the equivalent of five skateboard decks --  

294
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,047
and place them in a mold.   

295
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,117
skateboards vary in size and shape,       

296
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,386
so there's a different mold for each model.        

297
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,190
a press applies 44 tons of pressure,      

298
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,858
compacting the sheets     

299
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,594
and bending them to the shape of the mold.   

300
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,930
excess glue squeezes out the sides,         

301
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,398
binding the five decks into one block.        

302
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,602
they'll be separated later.  

303
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,138
the block comes out after three hours.       

304
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,475
now they drill two sets of holes
through the block.       

305
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,944
these are for mounting the front and back trucks --  

306
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,948
the pivoting, metal axles that enable the skateboard to turn. 

307
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,885
now it's time to give the rectangular block     

308
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,754
a skateboard contour.     

309
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,822
they select a template     

310
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,091
in the general shape of the model they're making.  

311
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,027
it has pins underneath     

312
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,029
that fit snugly in the truck holes they've just drilled.   

313
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,631
this holds the template still 

314
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,034
while they do what's called the rough cut -- 

315
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:27,638
sawing around the template, leaving a 1-inch margin.    

316
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,110
cutting off the excess separates the five decks.   

317
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,846
now they contour each deck individually.    

318
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,381
using a precise template,   

319
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,251
they run the deck against a cutting blade    

320
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,320
until they have the final shape.

321
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:49,760
now, using a router, they round
off the top and bottom edges. 

322
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,170
then they smooth all the surfaces against a drum sander.

323
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,948
now they switch to a buffer,  

324
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,819
which uses a combination of brushes and fine-grit sandpaper

325
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,121
to remove any rough wood fibers.

326
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,925
the deck is now perfectly smooth.       

327
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,231
the next stop is the finishing room,     

328
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,634
where they first spray the decks
with a colorless primer.    

329
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,103
this seals the pores in the wood veneer       

330
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,140
so they won't absorb the coat of lacquer that comes next.  

331
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,712
the primer takes two hours to dry.            

332
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,922
next, they spray on a coat of clear or colored lacquer.  

333
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,725
it leaves a protective, high-gloss finish.       

334
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,701
the lacquer also takes two hours to dry.       

335
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,742
the final step of the finishing process    

336
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,511
is applying the decoration.  

337
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,483
the bold graphic designs are printed on plastic sheets. 

338
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,753
the skateboard factory either buys them ready-made  

339
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,022
or produces them in-house,   

340
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:29,293
using its own silk-screen printing equipment.      

341
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,095
workers center the design sheet,

342
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,430
then feed the deck through a machine        

343
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,701
that applies heat and slight pressure simultaneously.    

344
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,438
the heat -- 390 degrees fahrenheit --   

345
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,642
induces a chemical reaction that melts the ink and lacquer.

346
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,445
when the plastic comes off, the deck is finished.     

347
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,717
decks of this caliber are sold 
unassembled in specialty stores.

348
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,053
they're designed for serious riders       

349
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,256
who want to customize their skateboards.       

350
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,192
they pick and choose from different types      

351
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,060
of trucks, wheels, bearings,  

352
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,196
even the bolts that hold everything together.      

353
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,667
all these factors determine how fast or how fancy     

354
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,602
their skateboard will move and maneuver.         

355
