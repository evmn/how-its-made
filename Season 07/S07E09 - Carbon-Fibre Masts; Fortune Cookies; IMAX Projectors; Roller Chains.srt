00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,025
            narrator:           
  today, on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,127
      carbon-fiber masts...     

5
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,732
      ...fortune cookies...     

6
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,538
      ...imax projectors...     

7
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,244
      ...and roller chains.     

8
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,986
    in the world of sailing,    

9
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,189
        lightweight ideas       
       are the best kind.       

10
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,925
     this carbon-fiber mast     
       is a good example.       

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,060
     at the half the weight     
      of aluminum or wood,      

12
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,062
       it allows the boat       
         to move faster,        

13
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,532
 and it's a pillar of strength, 
 easily holding up a full sail. 

14
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,534
     whether you're a sailor    
          or passenger,         

15
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,571
        it's nice to know       
  you can count on its support. 

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,213
     they launch production     
       of a sailboat mast       

17
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,615
  with a strip of carbon fiber. 

18
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,820
          they wrap it          
    around a long mast form,    

19
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,455
   which will serve as a mold.  

20
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,627
     they trim the material     
and peel away the paper backing.

21
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,231
    between 20 and 100 layers   
 will be wound around the mold, 

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,934
      depending on the size     
          of the mast.          

23
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,438
     they apply some layers     
     in a crisscross manner     

24
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,707
        to give the mast        
    more structural integrity   

25
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,943
   and help it hold its shape.  

26
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,382
  they cut away the overlap so  
 that the edges meet perfectly. 

27
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:10,996
  the material is a bit creased 
    and bulky at this point,    

28
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:15,033
  so they wrap it with plastic  
    pull tape to compress it.   

29
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,805
      then they remove it.      

30
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,207
      this temporary taping     
    is done after each layer,   

31
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,342
      but they leave it on      
       after the final one      

32
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,579
    and tape a breather cloth   
           around it.           

33
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,417
         then they pull         
    a long plastic vacuum bag   

34
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,254
     over the entire thing.     

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,431
  they seal the ends with tape. 

36
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,904
they attach the vacuum connector
    and hose and turn it on.    

37
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:56,241
        it sucks air from       
   between the carbon layers,   

38
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,243
    compressing them further.   

39
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,580
       next, it all heads       
        into an autoclave       

40
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,114
   to be baked under pressure.  

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,384
   this will squeeze more air   
        from the layers.        

42
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,918
        at the same time,       

43
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,722
   the heat will activate glue  
 impregnated into the material, 

44
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,425
 permanently fusing the layers. 

45
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,008
     they make this fitting     
      in a similar fashion.     

46
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,810
 it's called a gooseneck plate, 

47
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,081
   and it will connect a boom   
 or spinnaker pole to the mast. 

48
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,423
        back to the mast.       

49
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,598
 they pull the big aluminum mold
      out of the mast tube.     

50
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,502
      using a disk sander,      

51
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,307
    they rough up the surface   
      so paint will stick.      

52
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,309
      they drill two holes.     

53
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,245
       and using a jigsaw       
      with a special blade,     

54
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:11,283
       they connect them,       
      making one wide slot.     

55
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,920
          and remember          
      the gooseneck plate?      

56
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,657
  they trim it using the jigsaw 

57
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,426
   so that it will fit snugly   
          on the mast.          

58
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,765
         next, a worker         
    maneuvers a plastic pipe    

59
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,333
    with a string on the end.   

60
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,602
      he threads the string     
     through the mast tube,     

61
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:36,008
 then hooks it and pulls it out 
    of the slot made earlier.   

62
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,477
     it's a messenger line,     
 and it will be used to install 

63
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,847
        the rope halyard        
    that will raise the sail.   

64
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,688
 they also use messenger strings
  to install electrical wiring, 

65
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,759
     connecting such things     
  as radar, horns, and lights.  

66
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,195
      they're all funneled      
 through the inside of the mast.

67
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,101
 the mast has now been painted, 

68
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,904
    and a worker installs the   
 upper end of the pulley system 

69
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,239
        for the halyard.        

70
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,042
       he slides in a pin       
  that holds the halyard pulley 

71
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,046
      and bolts on a guard      
 to keep the rope from fraying. 

72
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,850
  next, they screw on a device  
 that will let the captain know 

73
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,287
which way the wind is blowing --
       the wind indicator.      

74
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,993
  he twist-locks a signal light 
     to the top of the mast.    

75
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,263
   it will indicate the boat's  
  direction to passing vessels. 

76
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,734
         now they attach        
   a piece called the toggle.   

77
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,068
     it's a connector piece     

78
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,971
   between the gooseneck plate  
          and the boom.         

79
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,211
     this carbon-fiber mast     
        is now seaworthy        

80
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,981
       and will soon make       
     its debut on the water.    

81
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,226
  narrator: the fortune cookie  
   is a snack with a message,   

82
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,363
   and the message is usually   
  as sweet as the sugary shell. 

83
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,631
          but there is          
      one surprising thing      

84
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,033
    about the fortune cookie.   

85
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,567
  it wasn't invented in china,  

86
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,171
    but in california in the    
 early part of the 20th century,

87
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:17,776
 and people in china have never 
really developed a taste for it.

88
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:26,250
   yes, the fortune cookie is   
 about as american as apple pie.

89
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:30,455
 but more than pie, it gives you
    something to think about.   

90
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,524
         to make a batch        
       of fortune cookies,      

91
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,126
they start with a sack of sugar.

92
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,730
   they empty the whole thing   
     into a big steel mixer.    

93
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,434
         fortune cookies        
      are about 20% sugar.      

94
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,074
  they add some food coloring,  

95
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,011
 just enough to turn the cookies
  that distinctive gold shade,  

96
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,480
        then some melted        
      vegetable shortening.     

97
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:00,151
    they pour in some starch    
         as a thickener.        

98
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,422
 pipes spray water into the mix.

99
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,031
 and then they add pastry flour.

100
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,736
   this soft wheat flour will   
 give the cookies their texture.

101
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,377
   they add a bit more water,   

102
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:29,113
    because too little of it    
 would make for a crumbly batch.

103
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,717
then it's time to mix it all up.

104
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,821
      after a few minutes,      
   they check the consistency.  

105
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,593
        then they pour in       
     more melted shortening     

106
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,929
    and a soy-based lecithin.   

107
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:49,734
   once that's blended in, the  
  cookie mix ebbs from the bowl 

108
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,770
     as a hose pumps it out     
        from the bottom.        

109
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:01,479
next, ejector nozzles squirt the
  batter onto hot moving trays, 

110
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,817
  making precise little patties 
 that look like regular cookies.

111
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,495
       you could call this      
 "the wheel of fortune cookies."

112
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,763
   hot molding plates revolve.  

113
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,298
        each one descends       

114
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,701
        and presses onto        
  four fortune-cookie patties,  

115
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:26,338
  flattening and shaping them.  

116
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,443
   they travel through an oven  
 that's almost 30 feet in length

117
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,212
  and bake for about a minute.  

118
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,783
          they come out         
     of the oven piping hot     

119
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,585
      and are given no time     
          to cool down,         

120
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,320
          because these         
     fortune-cookie patties     

121
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,922
        need to stay soft       

122
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:47,926
      so they can be easily     
  manipulated in the next step. 

123
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,930
    steel prongs push little    
 paper fortunes into each cookie

124
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:56,267
    as they fold it into that   
  distinctive butterfly shape.  

125
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,137
      there are about 5,000     
  different fortunes in the mix 

126
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,472
        at this factory,        

127
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,209
       so it would be rare      
 to get the same fortune twice. 

128
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,812
        this plant makes        
    a truly astounding number   

129
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,883
 of fortune cookies every day --
        about 4 million.        

130
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,493
     the folding molds open     
     as the track descends.     

131
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,896
      the fortune cookies,      
     now cooled and crispy,     

132
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,365
    drop to a conveyor below.   

133
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,038
  it takes each fortune cookie  
  through a wrapping mechanism, 

134
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,874
 which envelopes it in plastic. 

135
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:43,715
 then a hot blade cuts and seals
 the package in one fell swoop. 

136
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,789
  the packaged fortune cookies  
  transfer to another conveyor, 

137
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,792
      which transports them     
    to an inspection station    

138
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,729
           where many           
   production lines converge.   

139
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,330
  a worker checks to make sure  

140
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,000
       there are no breaks      
  in the package or the cookie. 

141
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,937
   he tosses out any rejects.   

142
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,808
   after all, a broken fortune  
    cookie could be bad luck.   

143
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,544
   a box moves into position,   

144
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,079
          and hundreds          
   of cookies fall into it --   

145
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:19,083
   350 cookies, to be precise.  

146
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,419
      they're portioned out     
      by a scale overhead.      

147
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,289
       then a plastic ram       
   gently presses the cookies   

148
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,459
into the box to reduce the bulk.

149
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,967
         a conveyor belt        
  moves the box full of cookies 

150
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,971
 under a metal bar, which pushes
   the flaps down to close it.  

151
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:47,512
    and now the time has come   
    to crack open the cookie    

152
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,181
    in the proverbial ritual.   

153
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,219
 hope our fortune is a good one.

154
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,330
  narrator: so, you want to be  
       on the big screen.       

155
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,466
       you won't get there      
   without a movie projector.   

156
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,802
         it was invented        
       over a century ago,      

157
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,337
         and the concept        
       is the same today.       

158
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,139
          film revolves         
       in front of a light      

159
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,341
         which projects         
     an image onto a screen.    

160
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,944
         but the latest         
   technological advancements   

161
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,380
 allow for much bigger screens. 

162
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,157
      its film is 10 times      
       larger than normal,      

163
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,827
        and the projector       
     magnifies it 400 times     

164
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,496
           as it moves          
   in a sideways-rolling loop,  

165
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,466
           rather than          
 the traditional vertical feed. 

166
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,638
           and instead          
     of the usual sprockets,    

167
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,974
        registration pins       
    retract as the film loads   

168
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,311
       and then reach out       
    to steady it as it rolls.   

169
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,449
         a vacuum sucks         
 the film to the aperture lens. 

170
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:02,554
    this is how they keep the   
gigantic image perfectly steady.

171
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:08,126
   to make an imax projector,   
  they bolt two prisms together 

172
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,564
 and mount them on a part called
 the lower illumination module. 

173
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,270
  the prisms and a mirror will  
  reflect the projector's light 

174
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,339
    to a similar part called    
 the upper illumination module, 

175
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,543
   which will relay the light   
          to the lens.          

176
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,682
     it's a fly's-eye lens,     

177
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,351
   a collection of many lenses  
          on one glass.         

178
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,621
         each will focus        
       to a single point,       

179
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,724
        ensuring an even        
     distribution of light.     

180
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,296
       a technician screws      
  two fly's-eye lenses together 

181
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:49,134
    and then places them in a   
fixture to align the two halves.

182
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,106
     he switches on a light     

183
00:12:56,143 --> 00:13:00,978
  and places an alignment guide 
        over the lenses.        

184
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,848
 there are red and green filters
         on this guide,         

185
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,818
 and he brings them into focus. 

186
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:23,134
      he adjusts them until     
 the red and green lines merge. 

187
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,372
   it means the two fly's-eye   
     lenses are now aligned.    

188
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,678
       next, they install       
  the upper illumination module 

189
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:40,051
     in the projector frame,    
     and then they flip it.     

190
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,425
 they remove the protective cap 
         from the back.         

191
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,562
       then they attach it      
to the lower illumination module

192
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,965
 which we saw assembled earlier.

193
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,674
    here, they bolt together    
  the rotor support and motor.  

194
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:11,249
  the rotor is this big wheel.  
it's the heart of the projector.

195
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,983
   it drives the film forward   

196
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,187
       in that distinctive      
        wavelike action.        

197
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,063
  this piece, called a stader,  

198
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,865
       will act as a guide      
          for the film.         

199
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,202
   he fits the aperture block   
   on the front of the frame.   

200
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,177
         using a crane,         
  they lower it onto the base.  

201
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,151
    they screw in spacer bars   

202
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,688
           and install          
 the second projector assembly. 

203
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,026
      these two assemblies      
     will enable the system     

204
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,628
to run three-dimensional movies.

205
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,897
          now it's time         
    to position the main lens   

206
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,968
 at the front of the projector. 

207
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,772
    they remove the lens cap,   
   and it's time for the film.  

208
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:11,108
      the film wave happens     
       24 times a second.       

209
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,178
 we've slowed down this footage 
  so you can see it all happen. 

210
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:23,654
the film of a test chart ripples
    in front of the aperture,   

211
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:27,725
  and then vacuums pull it down 
     for a 1/24 of a second.    

212
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,130
  this eliminates any shakiness 
     in the projected image.    

213
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,868
      now we're showing it      
          in real time.         

214
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,838
      you get the picture.      

215
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,614
  there's also nothing ordinary 

216
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,684
         about the lamps        
    the imax projector uses.    

217
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:58,155
 they're very powerful, but they
 use the light very efficiently.

218
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,426
        and now it's time       
       to enjoy the show.       

219
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,903
            narrator:           
roller chains are used all over.

220
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,905
  we're all familiar with them  
          as the chains         

221
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,473
        that move energy        
   to the wheels of our bikes.  

222
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,776
        but roller chains       
      also transfer energy      

223
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,645
          in industrial         
   and agricultural machinery.  

224
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,115
 they really keep things moving,
        and without them,       

225
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:28,353
  a lot of important equipment  
       would be powerless.      

226
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,326
     to make a roller chain,    

227
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,797
    a punch press pulls steel   
       from a giant spool.      

228
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:46,137
    using 500 tons of force,    
it cuts shapes out of the steel.

229
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,806
these shapes are the link plates

230
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,542
  that will join all the parts  
      of the roller chain.      

231
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,545
        the plates travel       
    on a series of conveyors.   

232
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,147
      an arm positions them     

233
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,617
      as they head towards      
      the next punch press      

234
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,919
      that makes two holes      
       in each link plate.      

235
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,494
            a worker            
   then pours them onto a tray  

236
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,830
        and spreads them        
        evenly across it.       

237
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,968
 a vibratory mechanism shuffles 
  them into a blazing furnace.  

238
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,571
       this heat treatment      
       toughens the steel.      

239
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,142
   then they cool down slowly   
        in a tank of oil.       

240
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,446
       after that, they go      
   for a tumble in the washer,  

241
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,649
 to get rid of the oily residue.

242
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,986
   meanwhile, another machine   

243
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,456
       uncoils some steel       
  to make bushings, or sleeves, 

244
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,725
       for the chain pins.      

245
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,896
  the blade slices the material 
     to the correct length.     

246
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,668
      then mechanical arms      
fold the steel around a mandrel.

247
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,771
        here's the action       
         in slow motion.        

248
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,741
          in real time,         

249
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,512
      it all happens faster     
   than you can blink an eye.   

250
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,219
  the bushings fall into a bin, 

251
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,422
         and now they're        
    ready to be heat-treated.   

252
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,226
      they open the furnace     
 and stand away from the blast. 

253
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,895
  a railcar takes the bushings  
        into the flames.        

254
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,630
   this may look destructive,   

255
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,467
        but the bushings        
     will come out stronger.    

256
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,675
  now it's time to make the pin 

257
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,578
         that will hold         
      everything together.      

258
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,381
       this machine shoves      
     a steel rod into a jig,    

259
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,317
   and a saw cuts it to size,   
          which varies,         

260
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,520
     depending on the chain     
      it will be used for.      

261
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,256
        a mechanical arm        
      then picks up the pin     

262
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,858
        and transports it       
       to rotating heads,       

263
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,862
  which machine down the ends.  

264
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,667
      the pins then travel      
    across a grinding wheel,    

265
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,603
       which reduces them       
     to a specific diameter.    

266
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,271
      next, they go through     
          a wash cycle.         

267
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,141
          a special mix         
    of lubricant and solvents   

268
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,645
     rinses away the residue    
       from the grinding.       

269
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,751
    these are the pins before   
       and after grinding.      

270
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,153
          now it's time         
   to put the pieces together.  

271
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,622
       this is a breakdown      
         of what happens        

272
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,891
       at a blurring pace       
      on the assembly line.     

273
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:23,628
  the link plates and bushings  
   go into an assembly device.  

274
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,096
  a ram presses them together.  

275
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:30,501
 they remove them and place two 
 more link plates in the device.

276
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,705
  they position rollers on top  
 of them and slide the bushings 

277
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,842
     and link-plate assembly    
           into place.          

278
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,779
 they press-fit it all together.

279
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:46,317
     and now they have links    
      for the roller chain.     

280
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,723
     the next step is to fit    
   the roller links together.   

281
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:58,462
 they clamp them into a fixture 
       and slide in pins.       

282
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:02,466
a hydraulic ram presses the pins
  to the base of the assembly.  

283
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,270
   then they connect the pins   
     with another link plate    

284
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,272
     and press it in place.     

285
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,877
    this is repeated as they    
   lengthen the roller chain.   

286
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,948
they can also widen it to enable
  it to handle more horsepower. 

287
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:21,052
     to do this, they stack     
 single strands of roller chain.

288
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:31,629
  they use longer pins to hold  
    all the layers together.    

289
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,099
        again, a fixture        
        holds it in place       

290
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,835
  while the ram does its work.  

291
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:43,507
          this produces         
    heavy-duty roller chain.    

292
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:47,511
          the one shown         
   can handle 400 horsepower.   

293
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,253
            finally,            
   they lower the roller chain  

294
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:59,924
    into a vat of hot grease    
    to lubricate the joints.    

295
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,728
       and that's the end       
    of the production process   

296
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,630
      for the roller chain.     

297
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,538
