1
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,854
     narrator: at some point    
       many centuries ago,      

2
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:59,458
 the thin, communion-style wafer
     took a delicious twist     

3
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,128
        with the creation       
   of the rolled wafer cookie.  

4
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,130
    the exact origin of this    
   tubular treat isn't known,   

5
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,199
   but it has been traced back  

6
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,903
   to syrian christian pastry   
 makers during the middle ages. 

7
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:18,210
  long and elegant, the rolled  
  wafer is one classy cookie.   

8
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:22,147
   it's crispy on the outside   
     and creamy at the core     

9
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,884
       for a sweet fusion       
     of flavor and texture.     

10
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,953
 it could be served as a garnish
      for the main dessert      

11
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,021
         or on its own.         

12
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:32,157
       it is, of course,        
       a matter of taste.       

13
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,159
ingredients for the rolled wafer

14
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:39,498
      include flour, sugar,     
   cocoa powder, whey powder,   

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,701
milk powder, and dark chocolate.

16
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,171
    there are 20 ingredients    
            in total.           

17
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,040
       they load each one       
      into a separate bin.      

18
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:52,377
 the bins all funnel into one of
 two big mixers one floor below.

19
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,847
            one mixer           
    blends the wafer batter,    

20
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,783
          and the other         
   prepares the cream filling.  

21
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,118
       a central computer       

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,988
        controls the flow       
  from the bins to the mixers.  

23
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,457
    it measures and releases    
         the ingredients        

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,660
  to follow the recipe exactly. 

25
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,797
    the computer also assigns   
   a lot number to each batch,  

26
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,333
     so if there's a problem    
        with the product,       

27
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,269
    they'll be able to track    
     the source and fix it.     

28
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,473
 down below, in the wafer mixer,

29
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,210
           the batter           
    is looking pretty smooth.   

30
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,144
they're aiming for a consistency

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,413
         that's similar         
       to pancake batter.       

32
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,816
     a worker scoops up some    
          to check it.          

33
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,417
     too runny or too thick,    

34
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,154
    and the wafer won't have    
        the right crunch.       

35
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,758
    the batch is just right.    

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,626
   the wafer batter now flows   
     onto four metal plates     

37
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,363
         that spread it         
 onto an immense rotating wheel,

38
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,300
          creating four         
  very thin ribbons of batter.  

39
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,971
    gas flames heat the wheel   
    to 300 degrees fahrenheit   

40
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:55,441
   to toast the batter strips.  

41
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,309
    at this high temperature,   

42
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,179
       the toasted pastry       
      has yet to crisp up.      

43
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:03,983
     it's soft and flexible,    
 which means it's ready to roll.

44
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,785
      coming off the wheel,     

45
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,456
     the wafer pastry winds     
   around a revolving mandrill  

46
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,560
  and quickly cools, generating 
    a continuous wafer roll.    

47
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,399
     the chocolate hazelnut     
          cream filling         

48
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,134
  is looking delicious by now,  

49
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,136
          and machinery         
     pumps it through a hole    

50
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,439
 in the wafer-forming mandrill. 

51
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,809
    as the wafer takes shape,   

52
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,378
          the mandrill          
    pumps the cream into it.    

53
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,217
     this mechanized system     
  is faster than hand-rolling,  

54
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,621
   and the wafers it generates  
        are more uniform.       

55
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,957
     the long, rolled wafer     
   now spins off the mandrill   

56
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,060
    and heads into a tunnel.    

57
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,031
 inside, a little ax swings down

58
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,969
           to chop it           
    into wafer-sized pieces.    

59
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,905
     the rolled wafer exits     
          onto a slide          

60
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,441
   and makes a gentle landing   
        onto a conveyor.        

61
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,312
   the cream inside the cookie  
         is still fluid,        

62
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,515
      and the pastry itself     
   is still somewhat pliable.   

63
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,720
  the next stage of production  
    will solidify everything.   

64
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,989
           it's a trip          
    through a cooling tunnel.   

65
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,591
  on this stage of the journey, 

66
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,527
    the various components of   
        the rolled wafer        

67
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,595
crystallize to their final form,

68
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:29,201
  and they emerge crispy enough 
 to be handled by the employees.

69
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:32,805
they identify any damaged wafers
        and discard them        

70
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:36,274
   as they arrange the cookies  
         for packaging.         

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,944
  this means compartmentalizing 
         them in groups         

72
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,513
     on a slotted conveyor.     

73
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,150
  after that, the little stacks 
        of rolled wafers        

74
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,820
         travel through         
      a curtain of plastic.     

75
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,689
            machinery           
cuts and heat-seals the wrapping

76
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,226
  in this completely automated  
        packaging system.       

77
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:57,429
           the plastic          
   will keep the wafers fresh,  

78
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:01,367
    but it won't protect them   
         from breakage.         

79
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,236
that's the job of the metal can.

80
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,704
  after an ink-jet-like device  

81
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,907
    prints the freshness code   
         on the bottom,         

82
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,308
the cans ride a magnetized wheel

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,279
        which flips them        
     to an upright position.    

84
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:21,386
  a worker then fills each can  
 with the plastic-encased wafers

85
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,056
   and puts a lid on the top.   

86
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,925
      modern manufacturing      

87
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,529
  has revolutionized the making 
     of these rolled wafers.    

88
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,666
        once individually       
    rolled and baked by hand,   

89
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,667
       machinery now does       
       most of the work,        

90
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,806
   producing more than 100,000  
     rolled wafers per hour.    

91
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:45,711
    but, of course, the taste   
  is still all about tradition. 

92
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:07,165
 narrator: unlike a conventional
 wood stove that burns firewood,

93
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,102
         a pellet stove         
   uses wood pellets as fuel.   

94
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,639
   made from lumber byproducts  
 such as sawdust and wood chips,

95
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,841
      which would otherwise     
        end up as waste,        

96
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,244
  pellets burn more efficiently 
   and more cleanly than wood   

97
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,780
           and produce          
   very little air pollution.   

98
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,787
       a pellet stove has       
  an on-board storage container 

99
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,854
         called a hopper        

100
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,057
           that holds,          
     depending on the model,    

101
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,660
up to 80 pounds of wood pellets.

102
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,131
 several computer chips monitor 
the stove's heating performance,

103
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,201
            dictating           
  the rate at which the hopper  

104
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:46,171
   automatically feeds pellets  
    into the stove's firepot.   

105
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,609
         the heat output        
     is manually adjustable     

106
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,145
      or can be controlled      
        by a thermostat.        

107
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,216
        wood pellets burn       
   far more cleanly than logs,  

108
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,586
   and the fire is smoke-free.  

109
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:05,691
   wood pellets are made from   
  a variety of raw materials -- 

110
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:10,028
      sawdust, wood chips,      
   wood shavings, small logs,   

111
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,229
       even scraps of wood      

112
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,099
    left over from furniture    
    and other manufacturing.    

113
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,701
      these different types     
      of lumber byproducts      

114
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,505
   first have to be reduced to  
 the same size and consistency. 

115
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,308
    therefore, the first stop   
   is a huge grinding machine.  

116
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,045
  inside, mammoth steel hammers 

117
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:31,249
   pulverize the raw material   
       to uniform pieces.       

118
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:35,854
    the raw material contains   
       about 45% moisture,      

119
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,655
     so it goes into a dryer    

120
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:43,128
  to reduce the moisture level  
     to between 11% and 12%.    

121
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,731
 so what was rough, raw material

122
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,767
       has now been ground      
   to a finer state and dried.  

123
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,205
 but it's still not fine enough,

124
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:56,809
     so it goes into a mill,    
   which processes it further   

125
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,646
       until it's roughly       
    the size of rice grains.    

126
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:06,018
     a feed pipe transfers      
     what is now wood fiber     

127
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,820
      to a row of presses.      

128
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:11,223
     these are the machines     
     which make the pellets.    

129
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,295
      the moisture content      
    of the fiber is critical.   

130
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:21,299
   if it's too wet, the pellet  
    presses risk clogging up.   

131
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,902
           that's why           
 each pellet press has a readout

132
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,139
           displaying           
    the fiber moisture level.   

133
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,977
      as an added measure,      
 the factory draws fiber samples

134
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,047
         and sends them         
   to the quality-control lab   

135
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,248
          for analysis.         

136
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,050
         it's essential         
for the stability of the pellets

137
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,386
        that the moisture       
     be at the ideal level.     

138
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,856
         excess moisture        
   would eventually evaporate,  

139
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,723
   breaking the pellets apart.  

140
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,394
          so to analyze         
      the moisture content,     

141
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,662
       the lab technicians      
         weigh a sample,        

142
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,932
  heat it to a high temperature 
  to evaporate the moisture...  

143
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,936
        ...then re-weigh.       

144
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:01,140
   the analyzer is programmed   
  to translate the weight loss  

145
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,409
         into a reading         
      of moisture content.      

146
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:10,416
the pellet press is a large drum
with perforated rollers inside. 

147
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:15,220
  the holes are pellet-width -- 
  2/10 of an inch in diameter.  

148
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,623
      as the drum rotates,      
   the rollers apply pressure.  

149
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,027
    this compresses the fiber   
             by 400%            

150
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:25,030
     and extrudes it outward    
       through the holes.       

151
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:29,301
  a knife slices the extruding  
 fiber at programmed intervals, 

152
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:33,238
     cutting it into lengths    
     of about 1 2/10 inches.    

153
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,242
 the compression generates heat,
  which draws out the tree sap  

154
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,845
         still contained        
       in the wood fiber.       

155
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,248
    this sap, called lignin,    
      acts as an adhesive,      

156
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,783
 locking it in the pellet shape.

157
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,787
  the journey from raw material 
   to pellet is now complete.   

158
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,724
      the pellets, however,     
are still quite warm and sticky,

159
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,926
     so they clump together.    

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,130
         the solution --        
  about 15 minutes in a cooler. 

161
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,666
   as the room-temperature air  
   blows through the pellets,   

162
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,268
       cooling and drying       
       the tacky lignin,        

163
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,004
      the pellets separate      
        from each other.        

164
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,807
      some of the processed     
          raw material          

165
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,477
   ends up in too fine a state  
       to become pellets.       

166
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,146
        so as the pellets       
        exit the cooler,        

167
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:19,218
 a vibrating screen filters out 
   this sawdust-like material,  

168
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,287
       which incidentally       
      doesn't go to waste.      

169
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,090
       the factory uses it      
       to fuel the dryer.       

170
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,693
     the pellets, meanwhile,    
      proceed to packaging.     

171
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,095
    it's a continuous system.   

172
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,497
        the machine feeds       
      printed, plastic film     

173
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,501
   around a cylindrical tube,   
  forming the shape of the bag. 

174
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,771
        then it drops in        
      40 pounds of pellets      

175
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,174
  and seals the top of the bag, 

176
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:46,311
     simultaneously forming     
   the bottom of the next one.  

177
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,580
       wood-pellet stoves       
       are fast becoming        

178
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,448
a popular means of home heating,

179
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,385
       and because pellets      
     cost significantly less    

180
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,721
 than most other types of fuel, 

181
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,190
       wood-pellet systems      
     are an emerging option     

182
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,425
  for commercial and industrial 
            heating.            

183
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,342
  narrator: a ring celebrating  
      a special achievement     

184
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,544
       makes a cherished,       
       lifelong keepsake,       

185
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,946
    whether it's a class ring   

186
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,415
         to commemorate         
   graduation from high school  

187
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,883
     or a championship ring     

188
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,619
         for the players        
    on a winning sports team.   

189
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,822
       as the years go by,      
  this special piece of jewelry 

190
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,091
       keeps the memories       
         close at hand.         

191
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:37,763
       championship rings       
    are entirely custom-made.   

192
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,499
     they typically feature     
     the team name and logo,    

193
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,501
       along with the year      
         of the big win.        

194
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,702
       they can also have       
      personalized touches,     

195
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,773
    such as the player's name   
        or jersey number.       

196
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,841
 class rings, on the other hand,

197
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,378
   come in several ready-made   
 designs presented in a catalog.

198
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,847
         graduates order        
      their favorite style,     

199
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,650
   then personalize their ring  
      by choosing options,      

200
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:02,454
   such as symbols, gemstones,  
     and engraved lettering.    

201
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,122
         for each style,        

202
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,326
    a jewelry designer first    
   sketches the ring's base --  

203
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,795
 the overall shape of the ring  
 minus the decorative elements. 

204
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,799
   then an industrial designer  
      transforms the sketch     

205
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,801
    into a three-dimensional    
        computer drawing.       

206
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,405
the ring's decorative components
 go through the same process -- 

207
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,807
     the jewelry designer's     
          color drawing         

208
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,409
     adapted to 3-d software    

209
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,446
 that guides a computer-operated
        milling machine.        

210
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,552
     the machine transforms     
     two blocks of aluminum     

211
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,953
      into a two-part mold      

212
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,823
 for each of the flat, detailed 
     components of the ring,    

213
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,826
      meaning all the parts     
      except for the base.      

214
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,561
   a steady flow of lubricant   

215
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:46,097
 washes away the shards of metal
     the machine cuts away.     

216
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,300
  bit by bit, the mold assumes  

217
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,737
      very intricate detail     
       of the ring design.      

218
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,975
    once it's finished, they    
  coat the cavity with a powder 

219
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,778
 that prevents the wax they're  
 about to inject from sticking. 

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,449
     then they load the mold    
    into an injection device.   

221
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,918
        it shoots in hot,       
  liquid wax at high pressure,  

222
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,121
     filling all the minute     
       nooks and crannies       

223
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,190
       of the intricately       
        detailed cavity.        

224
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,193
         seconds later,         
    they extract a wax model    

225
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:19,531
 of, in this case, the elaborate
   top of a championship ring.  

226
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,801
       to make a wax model      
       of the ring's base,      

227
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,670
 they use a flexible rubber mold

228
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:26,938
       because it would be      
          too difficult         

229
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,275
to extract the three-dimensional
    shape from a metal mold.    

230
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,346
       they inject the wax      
        at low pressure,        

231
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:38,150
as a rubber mold can't withstand
    high-pressure injection,    

232
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:42,154
  nor is it necessary when the  
 base has no intricate details. 

233
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,429
  the next step is to assemble  

234
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,565
         the wax models         
of two of the ring's components,

235
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,901
      connecting the parts      
        with joining wax        

236
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:58,770
          applied using         
  a fine-tipped soldering iron. 

237
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:05,977
       it's at this stage       

238
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,914
  that they also size the ring  
        for the customer,       

239
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,117
  either cutting out a section  
    of the shank to downsize    

240
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,553
     or adding to the shank     
           to enlarge.          

241
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,123
           next, they           
 begin building a wax structure 

242
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,459
        on which to mount       
         the wax models         

243
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,396
   for several rings they'll    
   be casting simultaneously.   

244
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:29,067
    they solder a small stem    
        to each model...        

245
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:40,178
    ...then connect each stem   
       to a large wax rod.      

246
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,430
       when they're done,       

247
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:02,200
 they have a treelike structure 
   holding all the wax models.  

248
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:11,443
   they solder this structure   
        to a rubber base,       

249
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,613
then slip a metal flask over it.

250
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,054
 next, they mix up some plaster,

251
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,657
blending it for a good half-hour
         under a vacuum         

252
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,060
 to remove all the air bubbles. 

253
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,701
  then they inject the plaster  
         into the flask,        

254
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,538
    engulfing the wax models    
and supporting structure inside.

255
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,340
     over the next 12 hours,    

256
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,644
       the plaster hardens      
  into a shell around the wax.  

257
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,215
  next, 12 hours in a hot oven. 

258
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,883
         this burns out         
       the wax components,      

259
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,686
         leaving behind         
      a cavity in the shell     

260
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,922
   shaped precisely like them.  

261
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,025
     now it's just a matter     

262
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,962
    of melting down the metal   
     for the final casting.     

263
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,920
narrator: the technique of using
  a wax model to create a mold  

264
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,189
            is known            
    as the lost wax process.    

265
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,058
          this company          
uses the plaster shell as a mold

266
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,661
          to cast rings         
   in three types of metal --   

267
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,731
     gold, sterling silver,     
      and stainless steel.      

268
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,768
  regardless of the metal, the  
ring-making process is the same.

269
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,074
 in just minutes, the induction 
 furnace has heated the metal --

270
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,811
      in this case gold --      
  to the required molten state. 

271
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,347
     they carefully pour it     
     into the plaster shell.    

272
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,684
    gold flows down channels    
        and into cavities       

273
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,886
  left when the wax burnt out.  

274
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,356
          once the gold         
      cools and solidifies,     

275
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,959
     they submerge the shell    
         in cool water.         

276
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,695
    this instantly dissolves    
        the hot plaster,        

277
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,597
    releasing the cast piece.   

278
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,769
           everything           
  that was once modeled in wax  

279
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,971
   is now replicated in gold.   

280
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,840
  they cut the ring components  
       off the structure,       

281
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,511
   then re-melt the structure   
       to reuse the gold.       

282
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,049
          there's still         
   a remnant of the structure   

283
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,919
     on each ring component,    
      so they grind it off.     

284
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,128
   next, using a grinding tool  

285
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,865
            so small            
 that it fits through the ring, 

286
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:51,136
 they smooth the inside surface.

287
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,605
       then they stamp in       
       the company name,        

288
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,741
         along with the         
 internationally recognized code

289
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,278
     identifying the metal,     
 such as 10k for 10-karat gold. 

290
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,482
            to smooth           
    the ring's outer surface,   

291
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,883
    they use a grinding wheel   

292
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,254
        which has splits        
     in its abrasive disks.     

293
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,025
       the split produces       
       a see-through view,      

294
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,328
as the disks spin at high speed.

295
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,369
     with the entire surface    
           now smooth,          

296
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,437
the ring is ready for polishing.

297
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,907
           they apply           
    some polishing compound,    

298
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,810
then, using another split wheel,
          shine it up.          

299
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:40,251
 next, the top of the ring goes 
to the stone-setting department,

300
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,520
where, using a fine rotary tool,

301
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,056
          a specialist          
      contours each setting     

302
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,392
      to fit the gemstone's     
          pointed base.         

303
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,568
  then he sets each gemstone... 

304
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,339
         ...forcing down        
   the four surrounding prongs  

305
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,175
   onto the edge of the stone.  

306
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,547
  next, he sets tiny diamonds.  

307
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,683
 he presses each one into place,

308
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,619
           then pushes          
  the surrounding metal inward  

309
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,354
     to hold the stone down.    

310
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:26,831
  the top of the ring complete, 
 they now solder it to the base.

311
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:43,915
       using an airbrush,       

312
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:48,119
 they apply a fine mist of black
    paint, then wipe it off.    

313
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,188
       this leaves behind       
       a black background       

314
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,756
highlighting the ring's details.

315
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,133
         now they apply         
     some polishing compound    

316
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,802
    to a cloth buffing wheel    

317
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,738
       and polish the ring      
     to a high-gloss shine.     

318
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:12,677
 they clean the ring thoroughly 
 in repeated ultrasonic baths.  

319
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,813
        ultrasound waves        
   traveling through the water  

320
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,951
dislodge all traces of polishing
  compound and other residues.  

321
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,362
          a few blasts          
      of pressurized steam,     

322
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,965
 and the ring is completely dry.

323
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,172
          certain rings         
  also have enamel decoration.  

324
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,973
     enamel is liquid glass.    

325
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,642
     it goes on like paint,     

326
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:48,146
 then has to be baked in an oven
         for 30 minutes.        

327
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,523
   finally, a computer-guided   
        engraving machine       

328
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,327
       inscribes any name       
       or personal message      

329
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:06,197
  customers request be written  
    on or inside their rings.   

330
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:10,535
 the tradition of the class ring
    dates back to the 1800s.    

331
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,872
       championship rings,      
   a wearable trophy of sorts,  

332
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:17,008
    are a more recent custom.   

333
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,012
both make a proud and triumphant
       fashion statement.
