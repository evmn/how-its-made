narrator: today on "how it's made,"    

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,993
macarons...           

5
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,034
pine-needle baskets...      

6
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,007
and micrometers.         

7
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,654
meringue cookies with a flavored filling,       

8
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,557
macarons were first produced in the eighth century      

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,426
in venetian monasteries.     

10
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,695
in 1533, the recipe came to france    

11
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,632
with the pastry chefs brought by the italian noblewoman    

12
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,701
who arrived to marry the king.  

13
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:12,137
macarons have been considered french ever since.  

14
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,776
macarons are as much a treat  
for the eyes as for the mouth,  

15
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:21,981
with colorful meringue shells sandwiching a flavorful filling.            

16
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,987
to prepare what's known as italian meringue for the shells,             

17
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:32,324
the bakers combine sugar and water.         

18
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,059
they heat the mixture to precisely           

19
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,695
222 degrees fahrenheit,     

20
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:41,366
slightly above the boiling point.        

21
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,203
in a mixing bowl, the bakers combine egg whites  

22
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,107
with dehydrated egg whites.   

23
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,312
using a combination of liquid  

24
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,281
and dried egg whites reduces the amount of moisture      

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,919
in the meringue mixture.     

26
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,186
when there's less moisture,   

27
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,623
it's easier to control the baking.           

28
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,125
workers mix the egg whites    

29
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,294
for about 8 to 10 minutes to make an emulsion,       

30
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,832
then add the boiling water and sugar.            

31
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,970
the combination mixes until the temperature      

32
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,739
drops to 104 degrees fahrenheit.           

33
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,975
no thermometer is necessary.   

34
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,577
bakers can tell by the stiff texture        

35
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,112
of what is now meringue.     

36
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:31,383
the next step is to flavor and color the meringue.     

37
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:35,187
workers weigh very precise   
quantities of almond powder...  

38
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,425
...then icing sugar.       

39
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,764
they transfer these ingredients to the mixer...         

40
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,670
...and blend them thoroughly.  

41
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,509
the baker adds the blended almond powder    

42
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,111
and icing sugar to a mixture of egg whites          

43
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,514
and, in this case, red food coloring        

44
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:07,486
because these will be raspberry macarons.       

45
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,722
they resume mixing for another two or three minutes       

46
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,892
until everything is thoroughly blended.      

47
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,894
then the baker adds this mixture        

48
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:20,366
to the meringue to color and flavor it.     

49
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:24,103
five more minutes of blending, and the meringue is ready.    

50
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,108
it's time to form the meringue shells.       

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,676
a worker pours the meringue   

52
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,480
into the feed vat of the depositer.        

53
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,917
the depositer dispenses 5-gram disks of meringue,    

54
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,087
60 disks per lined baking sheet.             

55
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,891
using a micrometer,       

56
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,493
a worker measures each disk to make sure      

57
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:54,266
it's between 1.69 and 1.77 inches in diameter.   

58
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,267
meringue expands with baking,  

59
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,103
so this ensures each disk    

60
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,974
will bake into a shell that's the correct size.     

61
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,878
then, fans blow air to dry out the tops.       

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,612
evaporating the moisture prevents      

63
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,848
the top of the disks from rising             

64
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,182
as they bake in the oven     

65
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:15,454
for 15 to 20 minutes at 249 degrees fahrenheit.    

66
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,858
when they come out of the oven,              

67
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,761
the baked shells are set out to cool.       

68
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,367
meanwhile, the bakers prepare the filling,       

69
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,738
mixing chocolate with piping-hot 35% cream.      

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
as the chocolate melts,     

71
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,376
they blend the ingredients thoroughly.   

72
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,644
then the baker refrigerates   

73
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:45,383
the filling for 12 hours at 48 degrees fahrenheit.    

74
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,519
when the filling comes out of the fridge,        

75
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,655
it's firm but malleable enough to be scooped up         

76
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,558
and put in a pastry bag.     

77
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,605
with filling and shells now ready,            

78
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,208
the baker can begin assembling the macarons.     

79
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,679
they squeeze about 5 grams of filling onto each shell...  

80
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,584
...then place another shell on top,      

81
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,254
pressing gently to spread the filling outward.       

82
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,424
the macarons fit perfectly    

83
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,860
into the slots of plastic retail trays,      

84
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,395
thanks to the careful measuring            

85
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,864
of the meringue disks prior to baking.         

86
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,602
the trays pass through a machine             

87
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:39,204
which seals them in a pocket of plastic film     

88
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,475
to keep out moisture.      

89
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:47,211
then, each tray is packaged in a retail box.         

90
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,080
this colorful selection features            

91
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,383
five flavors of macarons --   

92
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,986
raspberry, blueberry, lemon,   

93
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,488
cherry, and exotic fruits.    

94
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:14,005
narrator: when indigenous north americans   needed  

95
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,008
they looked no further than the pine needles      

96
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,776
that littered the forest floor.             

97
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,112
they wove the needles into sturdy baskets       

98
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,781
for their daily use.       

99
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,917
the making of these coniferous containers      

100
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,451
continues today,         

101
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,521
ensuring that it doesn't become a lost art.        

102
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,759
pine-needle baskets are beautiful examples      

103
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,427
of resourcefulness.       

104
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,298
they prove that something substantial can be made     

105
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,099
from needles that would otherwise       

106
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,567
just end up on the ground    

107
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,137
and be trampled on.       

108
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,373
the norway red pine in the northern united states  

109
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,142
sheds needles in the fall.    

110
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,644
just before they drop,      

111
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,780
they can be easily plucked from the branches.    

112
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,882
this forager also collects needles         

113
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,018
that have fallen to the ground.             

114
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,357
he tosses some pinecones into the bag too.        

115
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,193
back in the studio, a craftsperson immerses     

116
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,761
the needles in boiling water   

117
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,197
and simmers them for five minutes.        

118
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,435
this softens the needles     

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,038
so that they're flexible enough to work with.       

120
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,409
she selects a pinecone      

121
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,512
and boils it for 15 or 20 minutes.          

122
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,781
this causes the scales to close up,           

123
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,184
and the cone shrinks.      

124
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:37,055
here are the pinecones before and after boiling.    

125
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,992
the shrunken cone will serve   

126
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,060
as a handle for a basket lid.  

127
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,197
after winding waxed linen thread             

128
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,699
around the cone's base,     

129
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,535
the craftsperson loops thread around the strands        

130
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,338
to hold them firmly together.  

131
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,874
she now coils a bundle of pine needles around the cone              

132
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,111
and sews them to it.       

133
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:04,015
she sets the cone aside for now.              

134
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,752
next, for an effect that is simply decorative,    

135
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:09,087
the craftsperson coils pine needles           

136
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,822
around a colorful piece of stone              

137
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,891
that's been sealed in acrylic.  

138
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,762
holes around the edge of the acrylic envelope     

139
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,297
make it easier to stitch the pine-needle coil       

140
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,033
to the decorative center.    

141
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,907
the craftsperson gives each stitch a gentle tug     

142
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,343
to pull the coils snuggly    

143
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:35,747
so that it encompasses the acrylic edge.        

144
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,483
this decorative center is now ready to be used     

145
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,720
as a starting point for a basket or a lid.      

146
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,322
using another technique,     

147
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,757
she crafts a basket center    

148
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,561
using only softened pine needles and thread.           

149
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,563
this will be a bit trickier.   

150
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,968
using pliers, she pulls off the sheaths    

151
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,904
that hold the groupings of needles together.       

152
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,740
without the sheaths in the way,              

153
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:05,644
it will be easier to work with the needles.    

154
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,879
the craftsperson now takes a bundle        

155
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,848
that's almost the thickness of a pencil           

156
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,450
and forms a small loop.     

157
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,855
she ties a knot at the cross point.       

158
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,357
she stitches the bundle all the way around,       

159
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,693
creating a spiral with a threaded pattern     

160
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,095
that radiates outward,      

161
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,030
like spokes on a wheel.     

162
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,769
the craftsperson continually tucks more pine needles     

163
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,337
into the tail of the spiral   

164
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,473
to make it thicker and more even.          

165
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,543
she then weaves a basket base  

166
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,812
from the center spiral outward.            

167
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,153
she stitches each coil of pine needles to the one before it.  

168
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:51,456
and she aligns the stitching  
to create a decorative pattern  

169
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,059
that adds to the appeal of the basket.          

170
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,267
the craftsperson now tucks in pine needles    

171
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,302
with the black sheaths still on,               

172
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,905
to add even more visual interest.         

173
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,145
she artfully arranges them around the basket base      

174
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,949
and stitches them to it.     

175
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,385
from start to finish, it takes about 12 hours     

176
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,654
to craft the entire basket.   

177
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,092
after completing the lid with the decorative stone,    

178
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:32,531
the craftsperson tests the fit.              

179
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,633
for an alternative embellishment,          

180
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:39,838
she weaves red dogwood twigs into a pine-needle basket.    

181
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,407
it's another way to be creative with the materials        

182
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,043
that nature offers up in abundance.          

183
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:54,186
each one of these pine-needle baskets is an original,     

184
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,655
handcrafted by an artisan.    

185
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,191
and that makes them worth holding on to.       

186
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,676
narrator: a micrometer is a handheld   

187
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,445
typically used in manufacturing.         

188
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,914
a toolmaker producing parts for factory equipment      

189
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,583
or a machinist making parts for a product          

190
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,753
would use a micrometer     
to take precision measurements  

191
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,256
to make sure the part dimensions confirm   

192
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:35,126
to engineering specifications.  

193
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,028
micrometers come in different types     

194
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,330
and ranges of measurement.    

195
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,798
this model is designed to measure       

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,334
the outside diameter of an object.          

197
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:47,338
the graduations are in imperial units up to 1 inch.   

198
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,874
the micrometer's frame starts  

199
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,743
out as a forged-steel part    

200
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,113
that needs to be machined to the final shape.       

201
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,317
workers secure the part on a mechanical milling machine.            

202
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,854
the machine first squares the ends...       

203
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,159
...then slices the part down the middle,         

204
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:12,731
dividing it into frames for two micrometers.       

205
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,367
a computer-guided mill profiles the frame.       

206
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:21,372
this is the forged frame before this step and after.   

207
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,475
another computer-guided mill reduces the inside        

208
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,880
and outside diameters of the frame's hollow stem.   

209
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,516
workers insert a nut in the stem,           

210
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,319
then dip a piece of solder    

211
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,821
into a soldering chemical called flux           

212
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,324
and insert it through a hole in the stem.       

213
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,128
they hold the stem inside a soldering coil.     

214
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,164
the heat instantly melts the solder,        

215
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,000
fusing the nut to the stem.   

216
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,404
workers remove excess solder with a wire brush.        

217
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,845
then, they grind the stem to finalize the diameter.    

218
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,650
here's what the stem looks like              

219
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:09,754
before this last grinding and after.            

220
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:12,157
next, on the opposite end of the frame,          

221
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,159
they mill a notch.        

222
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,627
this is for the lock nut     

223
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,095
that locks the micrometer against the object        

224
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,631
while you read the measurement.          

225
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,772
workers now sandblast the entire frame.        

226
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:32,544
this removes all traces of metal dust and machining lubricant,  

227
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,812
leaving the surface pristine,  

228
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,749
a requirement for the next step --       

229
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,885
electroplating the frame with chrome.           

230
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:43,054
they complete the micrometer's frame      

231
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,457
by laser-marking the brand name              

232
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,325
and a reference chart of measurements         

233
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:52,130
in fractions of an inch and the decimal equivalents.   

234
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,466
this machine shapes a long steel rod         

235
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,868
into the micrometer's inside shell,          

236
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,437
which, in conjunction with the outside shell,     

237
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,073
displays the measurement reading.     

238
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,876
the machine first drills through the rod         

239
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,579
to form a hollow cylinder.    

240
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,581
next, it reams the inside    

241
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:14,052
and grinds the outside to the required diameter.    

242
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,987
the same machine also shapes a steel rod     

243
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,824
into the micrometer's outside shell.          

244
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:23,628
it carves a diamond pattern onto it called a knurl.     

245
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,900
this textures the surface, making it easier to grip.    

246
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,568
then the machines reams     

247
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,071
the inside to the required diameter.    

248
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,576
after sandblasting both shells,             

249
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,544
workers hang them on a rack,   

250
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,782
then dip the rack into a tank of chromic acid.     

251
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,516
copper prongs on the rack    

252
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,320
deliver a positive electrical current to the shells             

253
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,355
while the chromic acid is charged            

254
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,489
with a negative current.     

255
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,159
this magnetically draws a chrome layer          

256
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,394
onto the surface of the shells.             

257
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,934
then a computer-guided laser marks the brand name       

258
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,836
and the graduations on the inside          

259
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,972
and outside shells.       

260
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,175
this computer-guided mill shapes a steel rod        

261
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,611
into the micrometer's key measuring component,     

262
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,814
the spindle.           

263
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,384
the machine first profiles the outside.      

264
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,986
then it drills a hole 1/2 inch deep          

265
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,756
and reams it to the correct diameter.     

266
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,460
it's critical that the spindle not wear down    

267
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,128
with long-term use,       

268
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,966
as this would effect the micrometer's measuring accuracy.            

269
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,435
to prevent this, they harden the steel through  

270
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,337
a heat-treatment process.    

271
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,839
first, workers put the spindles            

272
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:46,710
in a furnace at a temperature of 1,526 degrees fahrenheit.   

273
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,914
after an hour, they submerge the spindles in oil,       

274
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,350
then freeze them overnight to stabilize the steel.     

275
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,220
the next day, workers temper the steel     

276
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,057
by putting the spindles back in the furnace for an hour,   

277
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,127
this time at a lower temperature.       

278
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,095
once the spindles cool,     

279
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,198
a machining tool grinds threads into them.    

280
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,034
the precision of that threading determines       

281
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,771
the micrometer's measurement accuracy.      

282
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,886
narrator: to use a micrometer,  

283
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,620
you place the object you're measuring         

284
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:34,259
against the stationary end   
of the frame called the anvil.  

285
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:37,128
then you rotate the spindle on the opposite end       

286
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,564
until it's seated against the object.       

287
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,666
you turn the nut to lock that position      

288
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,803
and read the measurement.    

289
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,607
the spindle for this model has 40 threads per inch.     

290
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,510
so turning it one revolution in either direction       

291
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,847
moves it 25/1,000 inch.     

292
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,749
if the steel hadn't been hardened,      

293
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,151
those threads would wear down over time,       

294
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,720
causing inaccurate measurements.          

295
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,722
for the same reason,       

296
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,557
this disk they now prepare to solder        

297
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,225
onto the face of the spindle   

298
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,562
is made of tungsten carbide,   

299
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,398
the hardest type of steel.    

300
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,667
after fluxing the face of the spindle,         

301
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:18,002
topping it with the disk of solder,       

302
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,806
and positioning the fluxed carbide disk on top of that,   

303
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,343
workers place the spindle inside the hot soldering machine    

304
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,413
to fuse the carbide to the face of the spindle.   

305
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:36,221
they grind the diameter of the carbide disk to reduce it               

306
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:40,158
to the same diameter as the spindle.         

307
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,359
after this grinding,       

308
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,061
the disk becomes integrated   

309
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,998
with the rest of the spindle.  

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,768
they grind the face of the carbide disk flat.    

311
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,271
then this lapping machine polishes the face        

312
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,939
to perfect the flatness     

313
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,476
and produces a mirror finish.  

314
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,478
they perform a quality-control check     

315
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,048
with an optical parallel made of sapphire.        

316
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,117
it projects bands of light which detect flatness      

317
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,022
to a degree the human eye can't perceive.         

318
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:15,659
this second test reflects light off the mirror-finish face.   

319
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,094
when rotating the spindle,    

320
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,797
the light should stand still.  

321
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,132
this indicates the face     

322
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,401
is perfectly perpendicular to the diameter.         

323
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,638
the micrometer's anvil,     

324
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,639
the fixed surface opposite the spindle       

325
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,275
against which you place the object you're measuring,   

326
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,778
is also machined from carbide.  

327
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,849
to assemble the micrometer,   

328
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,483
a worker places a spring     

329
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,587
in a recessed area of the frame stem,        

330
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,656
then the inside shell onto the stem.          

331
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,257
the spring applies enough tension          

332
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,827
to hold the shell in place.   

333
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:52,630
the inside of the stem will have female threads     

334
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,601
to match male threads on the spindle.         

335
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,436
this adjusting nut on the end of the stem      

336
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,205
controls the thread engagement  

337
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,840
between the two,         

338
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,644
enabling the spindle to move more tightly or loosely.     

339
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,580
the next step is cutting those female threads       

340
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,916
into the inside of the stem.   

341
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:16,186
first, a worker reams the stem to the required diameter,    

342
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:20,358
then switch the reaming tool on the lathe for a tapping tool.              

343
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,960
tapping is the term for cutting threads.       

344
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,262
they put the stem back on the lathe        

345
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,699
and tap 40 female threads per inch.   

346
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,670
now, workers can assemble the spindle to the stem.     

347
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,771
they mount the spindle      

348
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,807
on an automatic lapping machine.            

349
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,076
then a worker slides the stem over the spindle,        

350
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,345
going back and forth multiple times          

351
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,214
to fit both sets of threads together.       

352
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,317
they lubricate the threads with instrument oil       

353
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,322
so they'll glide smoothly against each other.       

354
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,791
after assembling the lock nut in its notch,          

355
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,727
the worker cleans the spindle face with alcohol  

356
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:01,065
and glues the anvil to it temporarily.           

357
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,600
then they rotate the spindle   

358
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,737
until the anvil reaches its adhesive-coated position   

359
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:09,073
at the opposite end of the frame.          

360
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,408
when the adhesive sets,     

361
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,278
the worker separates the spindle and anvil.      

362
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,081
using an optical parallel, they check the spindle      

363
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,183
and anvil faces to make sure   

364
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:23,721
they're perfectly parallel to each other.     

365
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,456
the worker completes the assembly           

366
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,726
by fitting the outside shell to the frame.          

367
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,996
it covers the end of the spindle that's protruding from the stem.              

368
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,533
a steel ratchet locks it into position.     

369
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,371
a final round of quality-control testing     

370
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,241
ensures the device works smoothly          

371
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,210
and measures accurately.     

372
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,978
in this test, they measure    

373
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,217
four different-sized measuring blocks.        

374
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,687
in this one, they bring out those optical parallels again  

375
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,190
to check flatness and parallelism.         

376
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,695
they also perform a cosmetic inspection      

377
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,899
and check that the graduations are all legible         

378
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,902
because, of course, no one wants a micrometer    

379
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,437
that doesn't measure up.
