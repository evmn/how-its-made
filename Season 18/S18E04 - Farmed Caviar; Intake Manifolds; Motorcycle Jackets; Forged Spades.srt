00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,185
            narrator:           
        caviar is a term        

4
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,187
       for the salted eggs      
      of the sturgeon fish.     

5
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,722
       a pearly delicacy,       

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,125
they've long been the snack food
       of the privileged,       

7
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,595
    enjoyed for centuries by    
 roman emperors, saudi sheikhs, 

8
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,265
         russian czars,         
       and english kings.       

9
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,635
    a few nibbles still offer   
    a taste of the high life.   

10
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,273
   caviar is sometimes called   
          "black gold."         

11
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,341
           no wonder.           

12
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,943
     a teaspoon of fish eggs    

13
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,946
     costs more than a meal     
   at some family restaurants.  

14
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:25,283
 for most of us, a little caviar
        is a big splurge.       

15
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,488
    overfishing has depleted    
 wild siberian sturgeon stocks. 

16
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,424
       so at this hatchery      
 in the southern united states, 

17
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,761
      they farm the species     
    for their eggs and flesh.   

18
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:42,233
    they feed the young fish    
      high-protein pellets.     

19
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,103
   the juvenile sturgeon fish   

20
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,105
   needs constant nourishment   
           to develop.          

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,510
 a computerized system dispenses
    feed every four minutes.    

22
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,178
    as the fish grow larger,    

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,848
      the feeding schedule      
      ratchets down a bit.      

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,917
            the fish            
    produce tiny metabolites    

25
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,586
     that are toxic to them.    

26
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,986
     those are filtered out     

27
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,257
     by bacteria introduced     
        for this purpose.       

28
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,859
      staff routinely test      
         the tank water         

29
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,531
     to ensure the bacteria     
 are doing their job adequately.

30
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,333
  after a few months of growth, 

31
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,069
     they transfer the fish     
        to larger tanks.        

32
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,939
     here, mesh drums filter    
  the solid waste they produce. 

33
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,074
   pumps constantly circulate   
            the water           

34
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,743
           to move it           
     through plastic nuggets    

35
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,546
  that house the all-important  
       filtering bacteria.      

36
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:28,947
      circulating the water     

37
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,818
  also disperses carbon dioxide 
     gas emitted by the fish    

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,222
  and introduces oxygen, which  
they need to survive and thrive.

39
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,758
        ordinary molasses       
     injected into the tanks    

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,227
           is consumed          
   by the beneficial bacteria,  

41
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,163
     helping them to process    
     the harmful metabolites    

42
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,832
      produced by the fish.     

43
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,034
    after five to seven years   
           of growth,           

44
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,236
          the fish are          
   at least a yard in length,   

45
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,438
and they should be full of eggs.

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
  workers transfer them to tubs 

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,644
        and mix in a gas        
    to put the fish to sleep.   

48
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,914
      now sedated, the fish     
   can be more easily handled   

49
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,050
          and are taken         
   to the ultrasound station.   

50
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,918
      using high-frequency      
          sound waves,          

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,853
           they probe           
     the sturgeon's ovaries.    

52
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,191
 this gives them a clear picture
     of her egg production.     

53
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,527
       she should contain       
   tens of thousands of eggs.   

54
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,130
   if not, she'll go back into  
  the tank to mature some more. 

55
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,534
       but if she's ready,      
  they'll harvest the ovaries.  

56
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,469
they clean the egg-laden ovaries

57
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,338
 and transfer them by the bagful

58
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,540
       to a chilled room        
       with filtered air.       

59
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,211
     this is just one of the    
siberian sturgeon's two ovaries,

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,414
    and it's a mass of roe --   

61
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,683
       fish eggs that are       
  about to become pure caviar.  

62
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,819
    they're extremely fragile   

63
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,756
  and need careful handling to  
separate them from the membrane.

64
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,293
this worker gently rubs the eggs
     against a mesh screen.     

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,768
  she sets the tissue aside for 
composting and lifts the screen,

66
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,907
     revealing the thousands    
   of delicate sturgeon eggs.   

67
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,476
         but this caviar        
     isn't quite ready yet.     

68
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,314
     she now rinses the eggs    
   repeatedly with cold water   

69
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,916
    to wash away impurities,    

70
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,286
    like bits of broken eggs    
       and tissue residue.      

71
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,992
         using tweezers,        
 she picks out remaining specks 

72
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,395
           of membrane          
    and crushed egg remnants    

73
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,565
        until what's left       
      is pure and perfect.      

74
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,869
       she pours the eggs       
   into a fine mesh colander.   

75
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,073
      the volume decreases      
    as the water drains off.    

76
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:39,077
  she weighs the drained caviar 
    and seasons it with salt,   

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,682
measuring an amount that's about
  3.5% of the caviar's weight.  

78
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,085
      this precise salting      
  maximizes the caviar's flavor 

79
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,555
   and substantially improves   
           shelf life.          

80
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:51,889
    she puts the eggs on ice    

81
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,160
      for about six minutes     
       to absorb the salt.      

82
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,495
       the salt draws out       
         more moisture,         

83
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,098
 so she drains it one more time.

84
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,034
       she then blots up        
       remaining moisture       

85
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,236
     with a highly absorbent    
          paper towel.          

86
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,971
she pulls away the towel gently,

87
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,242
  leaving the pearls of caviar  
             intact.            

88
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,178
          she packs it          
    into a lacquer-lined tin    

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,046
        and presses down        
      the clusters of eggs      

90
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,048
  to eliminate any air pockets, 

91
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,119
   which would cause oxidation  
          and spoilage.         

92
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,923
        she seals the tin       
  with a thick band of rubber.  

93
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,060
 this caviar has been many years
        in the making...        

94
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,527
         farm-produced.         

95
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,730
  no wild fish were destroyed   
  to get these eggs to market,  

96
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,268
   and that means they should   
  appeal to a growing appetite  

97
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,037
          for something         
   a little more sustainable.   

98
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,416
            narrator:           
       the intake manifold      

99
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,686
  distributes the air-and-fuel  
mixture to the engine cylinders.

100
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,422
      inside, a spark plug      
        ignites the mix,        

101
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,357
 setting off a combustion cycle 

102
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,626
    which ultimately propels    
          the vehicle.          

103
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,829
     for optimal performance    
         and efficiency,        

104
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,866
  the manifold must distribute  
  to all the cylinders evenly.  

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,171
      whether in an engine      
 with a carburetor like this one

106
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,308
    or in a newer-technology    
      fuel-injected engine,     

107
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,778
     the manifold's tubes,      
     called intake runners,     

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,515
  feed the fuel-and-air mixture 
 to the engine's cylinder heads.

109
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:30,522
 the manifold is made from long 
  blocks of extruded aluminum.  

110
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,523
  first, a computer-guided saw  

111
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,327
         cuts each block        
     to the required length.    

112
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:43,735
 metal cutting metal produces a 
 lot of friction-generated heat.

113
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,938
 a steady stream of water-based 
      coolant and lubricant     

114
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,776
   prevents the saw blade from  
 overheating and breaking down. 

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,682
a computer-guided machine shapes
the block from multiple angles, 

116
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,750
         transforming it        
       into the rough form      

117
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,688
    of one of the manifold's    
    two sides, called banks.    

118
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,691
   later, this bank, which has  
     four ports for runners,    

119
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,027
          will be mated         
     with the opposing bank,    

120
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,430
  which has another four ports  
          for runners.          

121
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,166
     the machine now shapes     
 the inside of the runner ports,

122
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,104
  which are curved and tapered  
     in a very specific way.    

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,176
 the banks come off the machine 
     with some rough edges.     

124
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,380
  a machinist smoothes them out 
    with a handheld grinder,    

125
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,316
   a process called deburring.  

126
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,518
  once the banks are finished,  

127
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,320
             they go            
  onto a flow-testing machine.  

128
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,724
it measures the airflow in cubic
  feet per minute in each port. 

129
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,059
 to achieve maximum efficiency, 

130
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,128
       each port must have      
     the same amount of air     

131
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,399
       moving through it        
       at the same speed.       

132
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,801
 the runners have been machined 
           separately.          

133
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,870
  a quality-control technician  

134
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,205
  runs a file over the runners  
          and the banks         

135
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,876
 to check for any imperfections.

136
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,146
 he then cleans all the surfaces
          with solvent.         

137
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,950
  the aluminum must be free of  
 any oils or other contaminates 

138
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,618
        prior to welding.       

139
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,556
        it's finally time       
     to mate the two banks.     

140
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,959
       workers mount them       
       on a mock-up engine      

141
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,228
 in order to get the fit exact, 

142
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,499
 then temporarily bolt them down
     to hold their position.    

143
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,242
    now a welder takes over.    

144
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,644
     using a high-precision     
        welding machine,        

145
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,847
    he first tacks the banks    
  to each other in a few spots  

146
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,982
   to secure the positioning.   

147
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,786
    then he fully welds them    
            together.           

148
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,323
        next, he attaches       
the intake runners to the ports.

149
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,993
     a light tap to make the    
  tongue-and-groove connection, 

150
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,896
       followed by welding      
     along their perimeter.     

151
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:02,340
a manifold has one intake runner
for each cylinder of the engine.

152
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,543
       this one's designed      
 for a fuel-injected v-8 engine.

153
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,879
therefore, it has eight runners.

154
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,688
      once all the runners      
         are welded on,         

155
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,892
 he closes up the manifold with 
  front, back, and top panels.  

156
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,631
 he welds these parts, as well. 

157
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,771
          next, workers         
      mount the fuel rails,     

158
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,373
         which send fuel        
        to the injectors.       

159
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,143
 the injectors go on afterward. 

160
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,913
             this is            
   a high-performance manifold  

161
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,715
         with a built-in        
      nitrous oxide system.     

162
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,519
  these are the stainless-steel 
       feed lines for it.       

163
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,389
  nitrous oxide is a compressed 
   gas that's high in oxygen.   

164
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,924
       it allows more fuel      
         to be injected,        

165
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,994
         which increases        
      combustion pressure,      

166
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:00,131
      giving the engine up      
to an additional 500 horsepower.

167
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,133
  they mount the throttle body  

168
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,336
          through which         
     air enters the engine.     

169
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,204
    the pivoting brass blade    
          in the center         

170
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,206
   is an air-metering device.   

171
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,875
      the deeper the driver     
      pushes the gas pedal,     

172
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,678
       the more it opens,       
      letting in more air.      

173
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,815
  the injectors simultaneously  
       shoot in more fuel.      

174
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,217
    the result -- more power.   

175
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,420
   this sophisticated testing   
    machine checks for leaks    

176
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,958
  and measures several factors, 
 such as the nitrous oxide flow.

177
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,760
 while the function is the same,

178
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,362
   the shape and configuration  
       of intake manifolds      

179
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,765
         vary according         
      to the type of engine     

180
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,868
in order to optimize performance
      and fuel efficiency.      

181
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,514
    narrator: first conceived   
        in 1920s america,       

182
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:53,184
      the motorcycle jacket     
 is designed for the open road. 

183
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,787
      made of tough leather     
    with an off-center zipper   

184
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,591
that creates a seal, this jacket
  is the ultimate windbreaker.  

185
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,394
   it also protects the biker   
      from scrapes and cuts     

186
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,263
          in the event          
      of a high-speed fall.     

187
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,800
      the motorcycle jacket     

188
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,202
          evolved from          
 other wind-resistant garments, 

189
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:15,006
like world war i aviator jackets
        and duster coats.       

190
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,474
       styles come and go,      

191
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:21,212
  but the classic biker jacket  
 has ruled the road for decades.

192
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,548
          they make it          
     from heavy steer hide.     

193
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,086
   a worker inspects the skins  
 for flaws and selects the best.

194
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,155
     he also pairs up skins     
  of similar hues and textures  

195
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,426
       so all the sections      
  of the jacket will match up.  

196
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:39,430
  he wipes oils from the hides  
   with a piece of sheepskin,   

197
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,068
     then stacks the hides      
     in bundles of 6 to 10.     

198
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,640
          it's now time         
      to select a pattern.      

199
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,042
          in this case,         
      it's a men's medium.      

200
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:57,182
  there are about 50 pieces in  
 one motorcycle-jacket pattern. 

201
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:01,319
  cutting the leather takes an  
experienced hand and a keen eye.

202
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,454
     the cutter works around    
        any imperfections       

203
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,857
    and chooses the stronger    
      sections of the hide      

204
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,258
   for the parts of the jacket  

205
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,261
      that will be subject      
      to the greatest wear.     

206
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,565
     it's a skill that takes    
   about two years to master.   

207
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,536
 they punch out small components
        like pocket flaps       

208
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:22,473
 and trim with a die, producing 
 stacks of parts in one swoop.  

209
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,409
          they call it          
     clicking out the parts.    

210
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,078
    these parts of the jacket   
       don't vary in size,      

211
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,015
   so different-sized patterns  
         aren't needed.         

212
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,484
         the next worker        
    lowers a hydraulic blade    

213
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,622
       to cut pocket slits      
 in several jacket front panels.

214
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,058
 this is called the pocket chop.

215
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,496
  working from the reverse side 
          of the panel,         

216
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,032
   workers fold back the edges  
       of the pocket slits      

217
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,902
       and glue them down       
with strong industrial adhesive.

218
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,040
  they gently hammer the glued  
 border to improve the adhesion.

219
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,844
   a few taps to both the back  
and the front of the pocket slit

220
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,713
         seals this job.        

221
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,850
   a seamstress sews a zipper   
         onto a pocket.         

222
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,656
  then she stitches the pocket  
      into the panel slit.      

223
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,990
    this is the right panel,    

224
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,661
   and this side of the jacket  
       gets three pockets.      

225
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,330
          biker jackets         
  usually have lots of pockets  

226
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,934
 because motorcycles don't have 
     much storage capacity.     

227
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:31,742
       she pieces together      
 the rest of the leather shell. 

228
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,111
        in the meantime,        

229
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,614
     another crew rolls out     
 quilted fabric for the liners. 

230
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,416
          they align it         
with other piece of the material

231
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,419
  that have been cut to length. 

232
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,488
 they place a weight on one end 
      and move to the other     

233
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,891
       to cut the material      
  to precisely the same length  

234
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,194
    as the pieces underneath.   

235
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,698
    once they've accumulated    
        numerous layers,        

236
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
 they're ready for the pattern. 

237
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,835
           this time,           
    it's a big sheet of paper   

238
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,904
          printed with          
      the pattern markers.      

239
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,106
  the pattern designs have been 
      precisely configured      

240
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,576
          on a computer         
    to minimize fabric waste.   

241
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,778
  using sharp vertical blades,  

242
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,647
         they cut along         
       the pattern lines,       

243
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,850
         slicing through        
       the quilted stack.       

244
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,453
     in a matter of minutes,    
  they produce liner components 

245
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,389
       for a couple dozen       
       motorcycle jackets.      

246
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,127
    in the sewing department,   
 the seamstress pieces together 

247
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,397
       the quilted lining       
   and stitches on the label.   

248
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,804
         she mates it to        
the now-completed leather shell,

249
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,407
    sewing from the inside so   
 the stitches won't be visible. 

250
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,944
        with the job done       

251
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,347
 and the off-center front zipper
           installed,           

252
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,682
         the next worker        
   turns the motorcycle jacket  

253
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,550
         right-side out.        

254
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,821
   she pulls the seams of the   
jacket over a pointed metal rod.

255
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:55,026
  this gets rid of any puckers  
    and rounds out the seams.   

256
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,295
    using a hydraulic device,   

257
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,431
     another worker installs    
button-down snaps on the collar.

258
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,700
        this will keep it       
      from flapping around      

259
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,903
   and distracting the biker.   

260
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,372
   a worker drives the prongs   
         of a metal star        

261
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,109
  into a piece of shoulder trim 
      and bends them back.      

262
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,977
 this and other metallic touches

263
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,546
       adds a bit of flash      
         to the jacket.         

264
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,852
  made famous on the big screen 
     by hollywood tough guys    

265
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,389
       like marlon brando       
   and james dean decades ago,  

266
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,894
 the motorcycle jacket is still 
  riding a wave of popularity.  

267
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,145
  narrator: shovels and spades  
     are indispensable tools    

268
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,214
    when it comes to digging    
         into the ground        

269
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:54,619
    or transferring materials   
 such as soil, sand, or gravel. 

270
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,754
     lower-quality shovels'     
        and spades' heads       

271
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,289
    are stamped out of steel,   

272
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,790
  whereas the best-quality ones 

273
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,461
         are constructed        
 from one piece of forged steel.

274
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,564
  the head of a shovel or spade 

275
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,966
       consists of a blade      
          and a socket.         

276
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,370
      the socket fits over      
 the shaft -- the part you hold.

277
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,306
     these heads are forged     
  from a single piece of steel, 

278
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,708
  far stronger than those made  

279
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,443
      of a welded-together      
        socket and blade.       

280
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,645
          it all begins         
    in the factory's foundry,   

281
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,247
       where workers heat       
         planks of steel        

282
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:28,485
  about 8/10 of an inch thick   
  to 2,000 degrees fahrenheit.  

283
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,423
    a massive press then cuts   
the planks into t-shaped pieces.

284
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,061
 each piece will become a head. 

285
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,930
  the vertical part of the "t"  
     will form the socket...    

286
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,400
 the horizontal part, the blade.

287
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,541
  the next press, with a couple 
   of strikes, forms a neck --  

288
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,410
       the starting point       
         for the socket.        

289
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,081
 next, they spread out the neck 
     between giant rollers,     

290
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,284
     flattening and thinning    
    the steel in the process.   

291
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,286
     then they lay the neck     
       in a stamping press      

292
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,889
that chops off the excess metal.

293
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,166
       next, they finalize      
        the socket shape.       

294
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,769
 the first strike simultaneously
   curves it into a "u" shape   

295
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,905
    and punches a rivet hole.   

296
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,108
 the next turns the ends around 
 to form a rudimentary circle.  

297
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,780
 then repeated strikes round out
   the circle, perfecting it.   

298
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,384
  work begins on the other end  
        of the "t" piece.       

299
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,586
 rollers spread and flatten it, 

300
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,822
     forming the rough shape    
          of the blade.         

301
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,394
         a press stamps         
      the precise contour.      

302
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,664
       another then forms       
      the required angles,      

303
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,200
   finalizing the blade shape.  

304
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,269
     the repeated heating,      
     reheating, and forming     

305
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,071
        renders the steel       
        brittle and weak.       

306
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,209
    that's why the next step,   
  heat treatment, is critical.  

307
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,546
    first, they heat the head   
   to 2,000 degrees fahrenheit  

308
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:05,283
     at a very specific rate    
  over a period of 90 seconds.  

309
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:09,887
    then they submerge it in    
cool water for about 30 seconds.

310
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,022
   this heating and quenching,  
         as it's called,        

311
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,559
           rearranges           
   the molecular composition,   

312
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,127
    strengthening the steel.    

313
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,564
  next step, a coat of paint -- 

314
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,567
   either clear, allowing the   
 natural color to show through, 

315
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,970
  or traditional green or gray. 

316
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,105
       they bake the paint      
     for about five minutes     

317
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,908
    to make it ultra-durable.   

318
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,243
the shovel shaft is made of ash,

319
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,113
   a particularly strong type   
            of wood.            

320
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,715
  they take a cylindrical piece 

321
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,718
     and saw an 8-inch slot     
          down one end,         

322
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,087
   then widen the slot a bit.   

323
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:49,127
  they sit that slotted end in  
 boiling water for three minutes

324
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,296
      to soften up the wood     
 just enough to make it pliable.

325
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,669
      then they line it up      
 with a horseshoe-shaped clamp. 

326
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,672
         a hydraulic ram        
 then pushes the shaft forward, 

327
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:05,342
 spreading each side of the slot
        around the clamp.       

328
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,812
       they move the shaft      
       in this clamp state      

329
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,815
  to a slightly heated chamber  
for a couple of days to dry out,

330
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:16,287
      after which, the wood     
 assumes this shape permanently.

331
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,756
      after putting a rivet     
 through the bottom of the split

332
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,759
  to prevent further splitting  
  down the length of the shaft, 

333
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,028
       they sand the wood       
       to smooth it out,        

334
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,832
          taper the end         
  that will go into the socket, 

335
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,035
  mount a riveted handle grip,  

336
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,038
then do a final overall sanding.

337
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,982
       the shaft now goes       
      to the assembly shop,     

338
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,586
  where they put it in a press  
   and mate it with the head.   

339
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,254
then they secure it with a rivet

340
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:54,191
     through the rivet hole     
         in the socket.         

341
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,394
       the next operation       
      is called linishing.      

342
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,463
  using a coarse sanding belt,  

343
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,132
     they wear down the wood    
    where it meets the metal,   

344
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,804
   making a smooth transition   
   between the two materials.   

345
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,508
  at the same time, they smooth 
   down the edge of the rivet.  

346
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,013
    next, they dip the shaft    
         in wood stain.         

347
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,416
         this brings out        
      the beautiful grain.      

348
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:24,355
once the stain dries, they apply
  a protective coat of varnish. 

349
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,558
other models have a metal handle
        on a wooden shaft       

350
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,695
        or a nylon handle       
     on a fiberglass shaft.     

351
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,334
 different designs with the same
 purpose -- to get the job done.
