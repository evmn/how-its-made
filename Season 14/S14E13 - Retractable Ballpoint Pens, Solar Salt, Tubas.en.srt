1
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,853
  narrator: the ballpoint pen   
  was designed as the answer    

2
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,855
     to the fountain pen's      
      many annoyances --        

3
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,059
     the hassle of having to    
            manually            
  refill the barrel with ink    

4
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,327
       that dried slowly        
      and often smudged.        

5
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,396
    the ballpoint has a tiny    
     steel ball in its tip      

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:09,034
 that applies quick-drying ink  
 from a ready-made cartridge.   

7
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,675
 when the ink cartridge inside  
   these retractable pens runs  
              out,              

8
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,545
     you simply replace it      
        with a new one.         

9
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,480
    working from the initial    
            design,             

10
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,349
  the pen factory makes molds   

11
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,852
       for all the pens'        
      plastic components.       

12
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,357
   the injection molder first   
   shoots hot liquid plastic    

13
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,693
  into molds for the barrel's   
          rigid core,           

14
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,964
     then into other molds      
   for its soft rubber grip.    

15
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,568
      the tubes for the ink     
           cartridges           
   are also made of plastic.    

16
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,105
     machinery aligns them      
    in the same direction,      

17
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,809
   then prints on the company   
              name,             
  model number, and tip size.   

18
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,783
    here, a filling machine     
   injects 0.8 grams of ink     

19
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,117
       through the tip.         

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,920
       to prevent the ink       
       from evaporating,        

21
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:06,058
  it plugs the other end with   
 0.1 grams of silicone paste.   

22
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,595
           meanwhile,           
    high-precision machines     

23
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,130
      progressively shape       
         the pen's tip          

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,133
out of stainless-steel blanks.  

25
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,737
      the equipment drills      
    a 1-millimeter channel      

26
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,206
      through the blank,        

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,209
   then, in quick succession,   
 fashions the tip into a cone,  

28
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,412
     cuts five tiny ink-flow    
            channels            
      in the ball socket,       

29
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,548
           and seats            
    a 1-millimeter-diameter     

30
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,850
      stainless-steel ball      
        in the center.          

31
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,956
        another machine         
  then inserts a finished tip   

32
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,591
   in each ink-filled tube.     

33
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:49,701
    a scanner then checks the   
             length             
      and the ball of each      
           cartridge.           

34
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,170
       this magnification       
        shows the width         

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,574
 of the five ink-flow channels  
     next to a human hair.      

36
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,777
     random samples undergo     
     an air-pressure test       

37
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,446
  to check the ball's position  
         and movement.          

38
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:05,851
   anything less than perfect   
      will clog the pen.        

39
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,688
 they close off the end of the  
 cartridge with a plastic cap.  

40
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,594
      the cartridge is now      
    going to a centrifuge,      

41
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,662
   which forces the ink to the  
              tip,              

42
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,366
  eliminating any air bubbles   
 that would obstruct ink flow.  

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,342
 every cartridge passes through 
  this writing-test machine.    

44
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,210
  that blue light is a sensor   

45
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,215
  that triggers the machine to  
      reject any defective      
           cartridge.           

46
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,954
     the components now come    
            together            
  in the assembly department.   

47
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,491
    the machine assembles the   
              clip,             
      sleeve, and barrel.       

48
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,761
      the clip is made of       
  chrome-plated spring steel,   

49
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,165
  a strong metal that regains   
    its shape when flexed.      

50
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,168
     the machine then flips     
       the assembly over        

51
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,703
           to receive           
   the internal components.     

52
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,440
   first, the pen's two-part    
    push-button mechanism.      

53
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,710
          part one --           
   the plastic push button.     

54
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,713
          part two --           
   a device called a rotor.     

55
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,851
  which each click, it rotates  
     the refill 45 degrees      

56
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,753
   so the tip wears evenly.     

57
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,058
       the ink cartridge        
     goes in tip-side up,       

58
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,329
      the plug on the back      
    fitting into the rotor.     

59
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:28,667
       this device forces       
          spring-steel          
 wire through a coiling block.  

60
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,402
  this produces a tiny spring   

61
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:34,239
    that provides resistance    
 to the push-button mechanism.  

62
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:40,879
  a grabber places the spring   
    over the cartridge tip.     

63
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,887
   now they close up the pen    

64
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,590
   by adjoining the barrel's    
         bottom part.           

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,227
       the machine screws       
    the two parts together      

66
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,363
   to a specific tightness.     

67
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,566
   the final assembly machine   
              tests             
   the push-button mechanism    

68
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,102
     to ensure it retracts      
       the tip properly.        

69
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,972
  this also prepares the pens   
        for packaging,          

70
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,342
   as they go into the boxes    
     with tips retracted.       

71
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:20,051
  the factory subjects random   
 samples to endurance testing.  

72
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,855
       this device clicks       
the push button 100,000 times.  

73
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,793
    only then does a printer    
  put the logo on the barrel.   

74
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,132
 this company's engineering of  
 its ink-flow channels and tip  

75
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,836
 delivers on average 2.5 miles  
   of writing per cartridge.    

76
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,750
           narrator:            
  salt comes from three sources 
               --               

77
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,552
        salt mines, land        
 that at one time was seabed,   

78
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,022
        and from oceans         
     and saltwater lakes.       

79
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,091
     factories extract salt     
  from water by evaporation,    

80
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,293
     either mechanically or     
           naturally            

81
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,629
       by letting the sun       
        work its magic          

82
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,765
   and produce what's called    
          solar salt.           

83
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,239
     this large hunk of salt    
            crystals            

84
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,908
   comes from great salt lake   
           in utah.             

85
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,711
     at full water level,       

86
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,048
     the lake is seven times    
             saltier            
        than the ocean.         

87
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:32,657
 harvesters scoop up salt from  
 shallow crystallization ponds  

88
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,226
   and load it into trucks.     

89
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,065
     it's the end result of     
 a two-year evaporation cycle,  

90
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,935
 which has seen the lake water, 
         called brine,          

91
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,738
  slowly give off its moisture  
               in               
    a series of concentrating   
             ponds.             

92
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,343
 what remains is a bed of salt  
crystals about 12 inches deep.  

93
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:06,491
 the truck dumps its cargo onto 
the factory's conveyor system.  

94
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,294
     first stop is a rinsing    
            station             

95
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:13,231
     to remove contaminants     
    such as algae and dust.     

96
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,834
        using freshwater        
   would dissolve the salt,     

97
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:20,037
   so they flush the crystals   
       with lake brine.         

98
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,908
  next, hot-air dryers remove   
  the moisture and salt dust    

99
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,178
   within about 3.5 minutes.    

100
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,984
  the salt crystals then roll   

101
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,186
        across a series         
      of sorting screens        

102
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,589
       with progressively       
       smaller openings.        

103
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,860
    this classifies the salt    
 crystals into three grades --  

104
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,696
   coarse, medium, and fine.    

105
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,270
        each grade goes         
   onto a separate conveyor     

106
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,273
       that transports it       
 to a designated storage bin.   

107
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,612
        the factory uses        
       medium-grade salt        

108
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,015
        to make pellets         
for water-softening equipment.  

109
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,686
   this press compresses the    
  crystals into pellet shapes   

110
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,154
 along with certain additives   

111
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:13,692
  to help the water-softening   
   equipment perform better.    

112
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,362
 some municipal water supplies  
 have a high mineral content.   

113
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,031
   this hard water makes soap   
      difficult to lather       

114
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,535
  and leaves stains on sinks,   
    bathtubs, and toilets.      

115
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,372
         salt triggers          
      a chemical reaction       

116
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,407
         that dissolves         
     the problem minerals.      

117
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,383
      the factory packages      
  water-softening solar salt    

118
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,319
       in bags, as well.        

119
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,856
   it also produces a variety   
 of other solar-salt products   

120
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,858
  such as swimming-pool salt,   

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,194
   road salt for melting ice    
        in the winter,          

122
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,162
and, of course, culinary salt.  

123
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,535
    the factory's automated     
      packaging equipment       

124
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,071
        fills both paper        
       and plastic bags.        

125
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,347
 this company also sells solar  
  salt to several industries    

126
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:14,218
    for use as an ingredient    
in products such as detergent.  

127
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,288
          there's also          
   the agricultural market.     

128
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,093
   farmers buy blocks of solar  
              salt              
     plain or enriched with     
            minerals            

129
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,495
     as a nutrient for their    
            cattle.             

130
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,966
 the factory produces different 
salt and mineral formulations,  

131
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,535
  each dyed a different color   
   for easy identification.     

132
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,649
  to produce salt for cattle,   

133
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:49,387
  the machinery drops 50 pounds 
               at               
   a time into a block-shaped   
             mold.              

134
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,590
    a press applies 750 tons    
         of pressure,           

135
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,960
      binding the crystals      
         into a block.          

136
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,531
   the farmer simply sets out   
   blocks among the cattle,     

137
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,568
   and the animals lick away    
 to get their dose of sodium.   

138
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,352
  a label identifies the type   
        of salt block.          

139
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,621
   this one contains iodine     

140
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,826
 to prevent a thyroid disorder  
        called goiter,          

141
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,294
    a tasty and therapeutic     
         bovine snack           

142
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,032
  courtesy of a saltwater lake  
         and sunshine.          

143
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,382
           narrator:            
    the tuba is the largest ins 

144
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,517
          and the one           
    with the lowest pitch.      

145
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,787
  famous orchestral composers   
  from stravinsky to gershwin   

146
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,256
    have included significant   
              parts             
           for tuba             

147
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,659
           in some of           
    their best-known works.     

148
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,696
    some composers have even    
             written            
   full concertos for tuba.     

149
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,334
   tubas are made of brass,     

150
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,937
       sometimes silver-        
        or gold-plated.         

151
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:17,074
    the instrument consists     
     of valves and tubing,      

152
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,210
   ending in a flared bell.     

153
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,080
         the bell flare         
    begins as a brass disk      

154
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,550
    22 inches in diameter.      

155
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,620
   they use a range of tools    
     and various mandrels       

156
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,923
     to work the brass into     
    a preliminary bell-flare    
             shape.             

157
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,696
  they use sandpaper to remove  
 any marks left by the tools,   

158
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,732
then cut a hole in the center.  

159
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,709
    to make the conical tail    
 that leads to the bell flare,  

160
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,511
      they bend and hammer      
      a thin brass sheet        

161
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,313
 around a tail-shaped mandrel.  

162
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,586
   to join the seam, they cut   
    notches along one edge,     

163
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,789
        then hammer them        
     over the other edge.       

164
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,195
     the artisan then melts     
  filler metal over the seam    

165
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,464
    with a high-temperature     
          gas torch,            

166
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,835
 a process known as braising.   

167
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,673
 then they use a wooden mallet  
    to round out the shape.     

168
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,745
   they use a pressure roller   
    to flatten out the mallet   
             dents              

169
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,946
     and further refine the     
            surface.            

170
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,816
  after notching the wider end  
         of the tail,           

171
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,486
        they assemble it        
      to the bell flare.        

172
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,355
       they dab on flux,        

173
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,357
    a chemical that prepares    
   the surface for braising,    

174
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,460
 then tack the parts together.  

175
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:52,771
  they hammer down the notches  
     and braise the seam all    
            around.             

176
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,706
         this assembly,         
     now called the bell,       

177
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,441
    goes back on the lathe.     

178
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,377
     using a belt sander,       

179
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,981
   they flatten all the seams   
    flush with the surface.     

180
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,452
    on another mandrel, with    
     lubricant assisting the    
            process,            

181
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,420
    they finalize the bell's    
             shape.             

182
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,661
     now they trim the edge     
  to the correct diameter...    

183
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,298
   ...bend it back a bit...     

184
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,204
    ...polish the perimeter     
    with the sanding head,      

185
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:30,008
    then use a special tool     
 to roll the edge over itself.  

186
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,877
    this forms what's called    
        the bell bead,          

187
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,946
a lip that reinforces the bell  

188
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,616
   and gives this end of the    
  instrument a finished look.   

189
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,019
       a computer-guided        
       engraving machine        

190
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,289
     puts the company logo      
 and model number on the bell.  

191
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,428
       each of the tuba's       
        100 or so tubes         

192
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,965
          must be bent          
    into a specific shape.      

193
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:58,036
 the first step is to fill them 
    with hot liquid pitch,      

194
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,104
  which hardens as it cools.    

195
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:05,309
      this keeps the tubes      
   from collapsing as they're   
             bent.              

196
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,181
   after bending, the tubes go  
              into              
an oven to melt out the pitch.  

197
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,719
     certain bent tubes are     
            enlarged            

198
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,188
      in a machine called       
  a hydraulic blowout press.    

199
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,725
      it pumps oil into it      
       at high pressure.        

200
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,128
   this blows the tube walls    
   outward against the dye,     

201
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,631
      forcing it to assume      
        the new shape.          

202
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:43,548
     certain bent tubes are     
            conical,            
     others, cylindrical.       

203
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,750
     the cylindrical ones go    
            through             

204
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,352
         what's called          
     a ball-out operation.      

205
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,624
    this machine forces steel   
              balls             
    of the proper diameter      

206
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,158
       through the tube.        

207
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,794
    this enlarges any spots     
     that are too narrow.       

208
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,772
 before bending, certain tubes  

209
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,143
  have to go through a drawing  
     machine for resizing.      

210
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,713
with lubricant easing the way,  

211
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,248
       it draws the tube        
   between an inner mandrel     

212
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,717
     and an outer washer.       

213
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,854
      this forms the tube       
   to the correct diameters     

214
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,188
      and wall thickness,       

215
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,125
    while also stretching it    
          lengthwise.           

216
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,261
        coming up next,         

217
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,531
 we'll see where this tube fits 
  in the finished instrument.   

218
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,150
      narrator: tubas come      
    in different versions.      

219
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:56,020
  a b-flat tuba, for example,   
    is nearly 18 feet long,     

220
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,357
       whereas an f tuba        
   is about 11.5 feet long.     

221
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,960
      tubas have anywhere       
   from three to six valves.    

222
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,362
       pressing different       
      valve combinations        

223
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,864
   produces different notes.    

224
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,704
  to build the valve section,   

225
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:18,042
    they insert parts called    
knuckles into the valve cases.  

226
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,983
  spacers hold the valve cases  
  the proper distance apart,    

227
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,187
   while this alignment plate   
      positions the cases       

228
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,922
 in the correct configuration.  

229
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,262
  next, they insert connectors  
     to later link the valve    
            section             

230
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,331
to the rest of the instrument.  

231
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,001
         after braising         
      the parts together,       

232
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,938
 they run a cutter through the  
   valve cases to hollow them   
              out.              

233
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,009
     here, you can see what     
 the case interiors look like   

234
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,412
   before cutting and after.    

235
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,748
    now they begin soldering    
on the valve section's tubing,  

236
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,318
          working from          
   the valve cases outward.     

237
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:11,362
   the tuba's frame section is  
              made              
 up of several u-shaped parts.  

238
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,465
     workers assemble them      
    with connecting rings.      

239
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,209
  they insert a support brace   
  inside this frame piece...    

240
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,715
     ...then position tabs      

241
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,185
 onto which they'll later mount 
      the valve section.        

242
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:38,156
 they clamp the tabs in place,  
     then solder them on.       

243
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,738
        then they attach        
the bell section to the frame.  

244
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,808
     before adding the valve    
            section,            
     they give a preliminary    
            buffing             

245
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,710
   to what they've assembled    
            so far.             

246
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,494
        they brush some         
   liquid polishing compound    

247
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,830
   into the places that they    
couldn't access with the wheel  

248
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,100
   and buff those areas with a  
              rag.              

249
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,578
 then a final overall buffing   

250
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,782
    until the brass reflects    
        like a mirror.          

251
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,327
  meanwhile, the valve-section  
      assembly continues.       

252
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,665
    first, they close off the   
             bottom             
      of each valve case        

253
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,234
    with a screw-on cap...      

254
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,204
   ...then drop in a spring     

255
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,574
     to provide resistance      
     for the valve piston.      

256
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,844
       then the piston.         

257
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:16,554
   a felt to cushion it, a top  
              cap,              
   another cushioning felt,     

258
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,290
    and, finally, the finger    
            button.             

259
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,830
    a little oil ensures all    
  the buttons move smoothly.    

260
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,366
        the felts inside        
      prevent the pistons       

261
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:32,036
  from making a clanging sound  
   as they move up and down.    

262
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,309
       now for the tuba's       
        tuning slides.          

263
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,312
        a coat of grease        
  helps them move in and out    

264
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:46,050
  to increase or decrease the   
 overall length of the tubing.  

265
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,186
        shortening tunes        
    the instrument higher.      

266
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,321
  lengthening tunes it lower.   

267
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,258
         now they screw         
  the finished valve section    

268
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,327
     to the assembled frame     
       and bell sections        

269
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,097
           and insert           
    the main tuning slide.      

270
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:09,073
 finally, the tuba's mouthpipe, 
   made not of brass like the   
             rest,              

271
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,575
     but of nickel silver.      

272
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,014
      they spray the entire     
           instrument           
    with cleaning solution      

273
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,850
  to remove any grease residue  
       and fingerprints.        

274
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,688
      prior to assembly,        

275
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,559
    each section was cleaned    
     and coated with a clear    
            lacquer             

276
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,862
 to ensure the tuba will always 
  look as good as it sounds.
