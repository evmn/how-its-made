narrator: today on "how it's made":    

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,427
potash,             

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,300
leather bracelets,        

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,640
wild rice            

7
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,445
and hex key l-wrenches.     

8
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,422
potash is used primarily    
as an agricultural fertilizer.  

9
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,993
it's extracted from underground by either conventional mining  

10
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,729
or by injecting hot brine into the formation        

11
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,699
to dissolve potash in salt crystals.        

12
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,801
it then pumps the solution back up       

13
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:13,672
and separates out the potash in settling ponds.        

14
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,875
potash is potassium chloride,      

15
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,544
the chemical compound kcl.    

16
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,348
it can be processed into a granular agricultural fertilizer           

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,819
or into a higher grade product for industrial use.       

18
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,554
at this canadian potash mine,           

19
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,556
the deposit lies just over a half a mile underground.    

20
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,026
the ore is comprised of three materials:       

21
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,096
kcl, clay and sodium chloride,  

22
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,831
the chemical compound nacl,   

23
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,401
better known as table salt.          

24
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,838
the big machine manufacturers use to cut the face of the rock              

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
is called a continuous miner.  

26
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:50,976
it has two rotors, each with three arms.      

27
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,113
each arm has six pairs of bits with carbide tips    

28
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,781
that grind the face of the rock,           

29
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,483
flaking off the ore.       

30
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,054
the rotor arms sweep the ore into the machine,    

31
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,923
which feeds it off the back onto bridge conveyors,      

32
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,459
a series of conveyor belts    

33
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,628
that lead to a main conveyor belt.          

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
miners fasten sheets of polymer             

35
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,869
to the rock above to erect walls          

36
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,337
which direct the flow of fresh air           

37
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,040
that's pumped down       
into the mine for ventilation.  

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,483
the bridge conveyors transfer the ore to a main conveyor.   

39
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,551
at this particular potash mine,           

40
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,819
up to 10 machines work      

41
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,156
simultaneously at different locations.       

42
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,893
all those main conveyors, nearly 22 miles of moving belts,             

43
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,962
converge at the skip,      

44
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,498
a gigantic elevator bucket    

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,066
which hoists up to 49 tons of ore at a time         

46
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:51,137
to the surface and dumps it into a storage bin.      

47
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,978
a conveyor transfers the ore to the mill for processing.   

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,718
first the ore tumbles down   
a series of vibrating screens.  

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
smaller particles drop through the openings       

50
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,455
and move on to the next station             

51
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,590
while larger particles stay on top           

52
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,258
where they are whisked off    

53
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,494
with the flow of brine into a crusher.         

54
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:22,334
the finer particles flow to the fine flotation tank    

55
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,271
while the larger ones sink to the bottom, drain out,    

56
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:29,341
then travel to the course flotation tank.         

57
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,510
the particles are treated with chemicals.     

58
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,882
over the course of five minutes in flotation,  

59
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,685
the chemical treatment makes the kcl particles attach     

60
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:44,290
to air bubbles and rise to the surface.     

61
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,824
in the course flotation tank   

62
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,559
paddles skim the surface,    

63
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,696
pushing the floating kcl into a collector.      

64
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,831
the clay and nacl particles drain         

65
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,569
out the other end.        

66
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,838
similarly in the fine flotation unit,         

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,373
the kcl particles attach to air bubbles          

68
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,108
and rise to the top       

69
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,112
where they overflow into a collector.        

70
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,948
the collected potash      
then goes through a centrifuge  

71
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,386
and a dryer to remove all the moisture.        

72
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,589
the dryer feeds this vibrating screening machine,   

73
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,794
which separates the kcl particles into three categories.           

74
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,596
oversized particles go back to the crusher.         

75
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,599
undersized particles go to machines     

76
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,334
which compact them into boards  

77
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,469
then break the boards into new particles        

78
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,672
which then go back to the vibrating machine     

79
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,141
for another round of screening.          

80
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,076
the final product size particles          

81
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:41,280
go directly to the shipping warehouse.     

82
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,481
this granular potash is the type              

83
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,618
used as agricultural fertilizer.           

84
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,754
it's kcl concentration is 95 percent          

85
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,491
because there's some residual clay and nacl.     

86
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,095
technicians regularly test product samples         

87
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,831
to verify the kcl content.    

88
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,135
they grind each sample into a find powder        

89
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,904
and compress it inside a stainless           

90
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:07,973
steel cap to form a pellet.   

91
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,108
then the workers load the pellet             

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,912
into an x-ray fluorescence analyzer.      

93
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,714
the pelletized sample absorbs  

94
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:20,452
that energy then releases energy as fluorescent radiation.    

95
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,322
the analyzer measures the fluorescent radiation    

96
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:26,826
to determine the sample's concentration of kcl.      

97
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,129
the mill also processes potash         

98
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,464
for industrial use.       

99
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,266
this higher grade potash     

100
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,469
with a kcl concentration of 99 percent          

101
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,538
is a white powder        

102
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,473
manufacturers make it by dissolving      

103
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,476
the 95 percent kcl granular potash         

104
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,348
in hot brine to remove more   
of the residual nacl and clay.  

105
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,283
then workers crystallize the potash            

106
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,419
by evaporation and cooling.   

107
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:57,756
the result, potash that's almost pure kcl.     

108
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,038
narrator: handcrafted leather bracelets  

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,574
are an unconventional jewelry choice.         

110
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,442
traditional bracelets are chains             

111
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,845
or bangles made of metal or stones.       

112
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,982
but these fit like a cuff and are eclectic in design.   

113
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,651
each one is an original.     

114
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,721
so the wearer can express individuality.    

115
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,394
handcrafted leather bracelets are substantial pieces      

116
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,530
designed to draw attention to the wrist.     

117
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:43,335
they can also complement an outfit in a big way.     

118
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,604
making one starts with a strip of stainless    

119
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,608
steel that will serve as the bracelet's base.     

120
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,346
the artisan bends it by hand into a round shape.   

121
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:59,284
using pliers she closes the gap a little more.      

122
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,220
this bracelet is meant to be large,        

123
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,689
so the loose fit seems right.  

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,561
she sorts through a collection of leather pieces and ideas   

125
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,432
for the design begin to take shape.          

126
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,602
she selects a piece to cover the inside of the bracelet.   

127
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,640
she draws an outline of the bracelet on paper     

128
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,375
to create a pattern       

129
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,378
and she cuts it out.       

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,714
she sticks the pattern to the leather.         

131
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,316
using a utility knife,      

132
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,452
she follows the pattern to cut the shape in leather.   

133
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,187
the edge of a triangular ruler  

134
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,957
serves as a guide for a straight cut.       

135
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,929
she peels the cut leather away from the paper pattern      

136
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,299
and applies a textile adhesive to the back of the leather.   

137
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,005
she curls the leather and inserts it, glued side down,              

138
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:57,075
into the steel bracelet form.          

139
00:07:57,077 --> 00:08:01,280
she applies pressure for a strong adhesion.      

140
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,948
for the bracelet's outer materials         

141
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,816
there are many colorful options,            

142
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,618
from dyed exotic leathers    

143
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,222
to luminous semi-precious stones.      

144
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,824
she sorts through the different leathers      

145
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:15,294
and stones, looking for inspiration.     

146
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,895
she selects a quartz stone    

147
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,265
and a piece of fish scale leather.      

148
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:24,636
once tanned, fish skins can be surprisingly tough.    

149
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,173
she cuts the fish leather    
to size using a paper template  

150
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,777
of the front of the steel bracelet base.     

151
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,779
she wraps it around the bracelet band        

152
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,414
to check the fit.        

153
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,920
she applies glue to the back of the quartz    

154
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:46,792
and then positions the stone in the center of the leather.  

155
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,793
the glue tacks it in place    

156
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,862
while she now stitches a beaded surround        

157
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,599
to permanently secure the stone to the leather.    

158
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,737
she selects special beading needles for this.    

159
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,672
the heads of these needles are tiny enough         

160
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,808
to pass through the mini beads.             

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,281
she'll use beading cord made of a tough polyethylene   

162
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,884
to string and stitch the beads.             

163
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,958
for the first three rows she uses silver beads      

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,228
that are two millimeters in diameter.           

165
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,365
she pulls the beading snug to the quartz stone     

166
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:30,169
as she stitches the beads to the fish leather.       

167
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,371
in addition to securing the stone,            

168
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,239
the beaded surround also serves           

169
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,843
as an embellishment to it's beauty.         

170
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,379
she completes the three rows of silver beads       

171
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,315
and switches to glass beads.   

172
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,517
at 1.7 millimeters diameter,   

173
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,721
they're a little smaller and trickier to work with.    

174
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,323
she pulls the thread through the eyelets of the beads     

175
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,058
a total of for times       

176
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,062
to form a tight pouch around the perimeter of the stone.   

177
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,667
she now applies strong glue   

178
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,404
to the steel exterior of the bracelet base.      

179
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,611
and it's time for the next decorative elements, black lace.              

180
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,615
she glues the lace to the base  

181
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,451
so that the flowery border overhangs.        

182
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,430
she now spreads glue onto the back of the fish leather.  

183
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,035
she wraps the leather around the lace-covered base   

184
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,204
and presses it firmly to it.   

185
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,044
she then stitches silver beads around the edges      

186
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:50,582
to join the leathers and encase the steel base.    

187
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:51,917
the beaded stitching matches             

188
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,652
the quartz stone surround          

189
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,287
for another decorative touch.        

190
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,461
this handcrafted leather bracelet is now complete     

191
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,596
and ready to add something completely different       

192
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,865
to someone's jewelry collection.           

193
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,283
narrator: wild rice is the grain harvested            

194
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,618
from four species of aquatic grasses        

195
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,419
that grow in many freshwater lakes         

196
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,757
in northern united states and canada.           

197
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,491
historically, indigenous people             

198
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,228
harvested this plentiful and nutritious food       

199
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,830
which they considered to be a sacred gift.       

200
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,369
wild rice was a vital food source       

201
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,638
for thousands of years.     

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,240
it also became a valuable commodity,      

203
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,443
which indigenous people exchanged with fur traders    

204
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,846
who traveled the territory by canoe and needed       

205
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:59,518
portable, nutritious food that didn't spoil.        

206
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,653
beds of wild rice plants still grow today     

207
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:05,657
in the shallow areas of rivers and lakes.       

208
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,994
people still harvest the rice by traditional means,      

209
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,929
in a canoe using two cedar flails         

210
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,865
and winnowing baskets.      

211
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,602
the baskets are made from bark pieces laced together            

212
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:19,171
with dried roots of black spruce trees.      

213
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,476
harvest time is usually in early september,       

214
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:25,944
once the plants are protruding          

215
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:30,148
from the water at least half a yard or so.        

216
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,885
paddling through the rice beds would uproot the plants     

217
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,553
so one person propels the boat  

218
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,955
with a forked pole        

219
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,557
while the other gently bends the plants         

220
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,960
over the canoe with one flail          

221
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,961
and gently knocks off the mature kernels        

222
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,497
with the other.         

223
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,935
the harvested kernels pile up at the bottom of the canoe.   

224
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,774
harvesting wild rice is a delicate operation.      

225
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,243
you have to knock just hard enough         

226
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,512
to dislodge the kernels,     

227
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,948
yet not break the plant stalks.        

228
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,185
each kernel is comprised     

229
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,955
of a fibrous hull encasing a rice grain.      

230
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,598
back on land, harvesters transport the harvested kernels             

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
by a winnowing basked or a grain sack.     

232
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,071
the harvesters dump them    
onto either birch bark sheets,  

233
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,073
a tarp, or smooth bedrock    

234
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,843
then spread them out to cure in the sun.       

235
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:37,081
sun curing takes anywhere from several hours        

236
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,152
to several days depending on the weather.    

237
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,891
the next step is to parch    
the kernels over an open fire.  

238
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,894
this evaporates addition moisture,        

239
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:54,099
enabling the rice to be stored 
indefinitely without spoiling.  

240
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,836
it also gives the rice a roasted nutty flavor.     

241
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,772
for centuries indigenous people parched the kernels       

242
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,908
on a woven willow rack above the fire,       

243
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,912
letting the rising heat and smoke permeate the rice.   

244
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,314
once the trade began with the europeans,       

245
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,585
the indigenous people began using cast iron kettles set   

246
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,587
directly on the flames.     

247
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,322
fresh rice grains are green and flexible.     

248
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,059
after parching they're brown or black      

249
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,197
and snap cleanly into two when bent.       

250
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,265
next comes threshing,      

251
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,934
removing the grains from the hulls.         

252
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,336
harvesters cool the kernels in the basket,          

253
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,340
then pour them back into the parching pot.      

254
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,143
before acquiring cast iron implements,         

255
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,545
indigenous people would pour their kernels in a hole     

256
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,382
in the ground lined with wood or animal hide.         

257
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:50,288
threshing doesn't require    
any special handcrafted tools,  

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,757
just a pair of feet.       

259
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,493
the pressure of each step forces       

260
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,095
the rice grains out of their hulls.       

261
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,034
this is what the rice looks like              

262
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:09,574
before threshing and after.   

263
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,309
the last step is winnowing,   

264
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,914
separating the rice grains from the now-empty hulls.    

265
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,650
there are two traditional techniques:     

266
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,585
repeatedly flipping the rice in a single       

267
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,388
winnowing basket like this    

268
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,724
or pouring it from one basket to another.   

269
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,594
the movement creates wind that blows away       

270
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:33,264
the feather-light hulls.     

271
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,936
eventually only the rice grains remain in the basket.      

272
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,738
today, instead of deerskin pouches,       

273
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,810
harvesters store wild rice   
in containers or plastic bags.  

274
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,612
the grains range in color    

275
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,080
depending on the body of water  

276
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,149
from which they were harvested  

277
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,752
and how long after harvesting the grains were parched.     

278
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,622
wild rice is high in protein in fiber,       

279
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,624
low in calories in fat,     

280
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,561
contains all essential amino acids           

281
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,428
and is rich in b vitamins,    

282
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,531
potassium and phosphorous.    

283
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,247
narrator: hex key l-wrenches are designed           

284
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,848
to turn screws and bolts     

285
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,184
that would otherwise be tricky to reach.       

286
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,386
they have ball-shaped hexagonal heads         

287
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,721
that take an angled approach   

288
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,856
to installing threaded fasteners.       

289
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,125
the long arms of these l-shaped wrenches        

290
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,629
also extend the user's reach into tight spots.     

291
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,801
hex key l-wrenches often     

292
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,604
come in sets to provide tools         

293
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,240
for almost every job, big or small.          

294
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,876
making these wrenches starts   

295
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,145
with 13-foot long steel bars   

296
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,015
formed to a hexagonal profile.  

297
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,284
a technician tests the short piece to confirm    

298
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,486
it could be bent without breaking.        

299
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:06,291
the steel must be hard, yet elastic.           

300
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,494
a diamond-tipped tool presses into another piece.       

301
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,362
the depth of the indentation   

302
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,432
is a measure of the steel's hardness.      

303
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,368
after the steel passes all tests, workers slice     

304
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,504
the just over 13-foot long bars              

305
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,973
into smaller lengths using a die cutter        

306
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,575
with a hexagonal profile     

307
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,244
to prevent any distortion of the shape.          

308
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,581
each steel piece then spins in a lathe      

309
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,652
as a computerized tool carves a gentle slope into the end.   

310
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:40,925
this is before and after the contouring.    

311
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,263
a second computerized tool shapes the end rounder   

312
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,464
to create a sphere shape     

313
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,267
that retains the hexagonal angles.      

314
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,739
an automated loader serves up the steel pieces       

315
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,409
to a spiral copper heating element.         

316
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,079
the element heats a specific spot         

317
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:07,018
on the piece to 1,112 degrees fahrenheit to soften it.     

318
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,022
a mechanized tool then bends the steel at this softened point              

319
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:14,291
to give it an l shape.      

320
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,495
the hex key l-wrenches have now taken shape.      

321
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,865
in the next operation,      

322
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,367
workers heat treat the wrenches            

323
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,769
to make the steel even harder.           

324
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,572
workers fire the parts in an electrical furnace,    

325
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,174
quench them in oil        

326
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,843
and then heat them in a second furnace       

327
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,578
that's not as hot as the first one.        

328
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,784
the heat treatment strengthens the steel but leaves a residue.            

329
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,721
a wash and then a sand blast cleans them up a bit,   

330
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,190
but the wrenches are quite tarnished looking   

331
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,191
so it's into a vibrating machine             

332
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,862
with ceramic stones and polishing solution.     

333
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:54,733
this cleans and brightens the steel.       

334
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,869
a magnetic conveyor extracts them from the mix    

335
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,538
and takes them to a revolving drum.       

336
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,408
here the wrenches bounce around with corn grains     

337
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,545
that absorb residual moisture from the polishing.       

338
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,748
what a difference the cleaning has made.      

339
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,351
on racks now, the wrenches take a dip     

340
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,355
in different nickel and chrome baths.        

341
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,223
the rack delivers an electrical charge       

342
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,959
to the parts,          

343
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,960
which attracts the nickel and chrome.      

344
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,562
the metals coat the wrenches   

345
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:28,766
for a shiny rust-proof finish.  

346
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:32,103
next a device spins the wrench in front of a sensor.             

347
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,771
the sensor detects and crookedness         

348
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,175
in the wrench's long arm.    

349
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:42,380
if needed, he straightens    
the steel with a special tool.  

350
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:46,117
the wrenches are now ready for a spray of powder coat.   

351
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,653
it will provide         
a durable finish and the color  

352
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:52,323
will indicate the wrench's size.        

353
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,126
after powder coating a robot transfers        

354
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:59,130
the wrenches to a printing station.      

355
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,465
a mechanized tool nudges the wrenches forward       

356
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,935
to put them in alignment.    

357
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,806
another robot moves in.     

358
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,008
it picks one of the wrenches   

359
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,411
and moves it under a printing pad.         

360
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,480
the pad stamps brand information        

361
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:19,216
and a serial number on the wrench.          

362
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,921
the robot retrieves the wrench and places i on a conveyor.   

363
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,760
they now make the plastic holders for the wrenches.    

364
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,629
this machine melts and molds plastic under pressure            

365
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,165
to produce them in seconds.           

366
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,036
a robot removes the plastic holders       

367
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,237
from the machine         

368
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,174
and deposits them in a bin.            

369
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:46,377
a worker now places two of the holders under a laser.    

370
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,648
he lowers the protective shield             

371
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,785
and the laser etches company information onto the plastic.  

372
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,590
another member of the team inserts the color-coded wrenches            

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,060
into the correct slots in the holders.         

374
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:09,133
they now have a full kit of hex key l-wrenches.      

375
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,203
it should have all the angles covered.
