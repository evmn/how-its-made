       suspension forks         

4
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,191
         were developed         
      in the early 1990s.       

5
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,395
 like shock absorbers on a car, 
     these forks expand and     
           contract,            

6
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,463
      absorbing the impact      
       of rough terrain.        

7
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,266
  they also provide traction,   

8
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,068
           which adds           
   both comfort and control     

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,570
      to an offroad ride.       

10
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,009
   there are plenty of jumps    
and bumps on an offroad trail.  

11
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,346
       a suspension fork        

12
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,150
 ensures a cushioned landing.   

13
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,688
      they start by making      
      the adjustment knob       

14
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,360
for the compression mechanism.  

15
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,695
       computerized tools       
     carve an aluminum bar      

16
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,829
      into a round shape        

17
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,433
          with grooves          
     for better gripping.       

18
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,968
  then, they add a protective   
        black coating.          

19
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,839
 a worker inserts a tension bar 
  into a quick-release lever.   

20
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:48,440
  the lever allows the rider    

21
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,842
      to detach the wheel       

22
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,710
   from the suspension fork.    

23
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,313
 he presses a fastener into the 
lever to secure it to the bar.  

24
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,784
 he lubricates the tension bar  
         with grease.           

25
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:03,789
    then, he inserts the bar    
     into the wheel axle,       

26
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,124
   joining it to the lever.     

27
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,527
     a steel pin holds them     
           together.            

28
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,463
       an employee places       
  the inner fork upside-down    

29
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,798
     in a hydraulic press.      

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,601
  he inserts the steering tube  
      in the center hole        

31
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:19,105
   and activates the press.     

32
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:25,077
    then, he lubricates one     
      of the tubular legs       

33
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,079
       and the upper part       
       of an air spring.        

34
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,014
   he pushes the part through   
    the bottom of the leg.      

35
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,482
     it slides to the top,      

36
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,650
       where he installs        

37
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,488
      an adjustment knob.       

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,292
   he inserts the lower part    
   of the air spring into the   
              leg.              

39
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,628
         the air spring         
     allows the suspension      

40
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,297
     to move up and down.       

41
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,703
  he snaps a collar on the end  
    to lock the air spring in   
             place.             

42
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,305
      the damper is next.       

43
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,707
         it's a piston          

44
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,976
 and oil-compression mechanism  
     that absorbs energy.       

45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,180
       he pushes it into        
  the second leg of the fork.   

46
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,249
      he screws a threaded      
       collar and valve         

47
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,850
   into the top of the damper   
              leg.              

48
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,588
           he adjusts           
    the damper's position.      

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,126
  he adds oil to the damper,    

50
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,197
      using a fill sleeve       
      to prevent spills.        

51
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,533
        he pushes a rod         
      through the damper        

52
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,870
    to get rid of any air.      

53
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,208
       once the damper is       
   full of oil and air-free,    

54
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,212
    he installs the top cap     
  and seals it with a gasket.   

55
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,981
     he screws a base ring      
       onto the gasket.         

56
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,889
       then, he installs        
     the compression knob       

57
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,825
   we saw machined earlier.     

58
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,360
   the knob allows the rider    

59
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,296
   to adjust the compression    
          of the oil.           

60
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:56,102
 with the inner fork complete,  

61
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:59,104
        they now move on        
      to the outer fork.        

62
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,373
 an employee inserts bushings   

63
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,843
      in the tubular legs       

64
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,511
         and activates          
     a two-pronged press.       

65
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,112
   the press pushes bushings    

66
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,049
  securely into the cavities.   

67
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:15,321
   he secures the inner fork    
     in a jig upside-down       

68
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,124
   and slides the outer fork    
           onto it.             

69
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:22,594
    he lubricates the spaces    
             between            
  the inner and outer forks.    

70
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,931
         after bolting          
the suspension forks together,  

71
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,134
 he increases the air pressure  

72
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,002
         in the spring          

73
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:34,340
 and caps the air-fill valve.   

74
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,009
       now, for testing.        

75
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:40,145
     a motor moves the fork     
         up and down,           

76
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,682
   simulating a bumpy ride.     

77
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,686
    a computer monitors the     
suspension fork's performance.  

78
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,692
    after passing the test,     

79
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,162
 a worker applies brand decals  
         to the fork.           

80
00:04:56,164 --> 00:05:00,900
  finally, he slides the axle   
   into the lower part of the   
              fork              

81
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,902
        and secures it.         

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,174
       this mountain bike       
        suspension fork         

83
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,577
         is complete.           

84
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,978
   now, a technician fits it    

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,515
    to the front of a bike.     

86
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:20,119
   he attaches the handlebar    
     to the steering tube       

87
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:22,822
 with a nut and a long screw.   

88
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:30,129
  next, he attaches the wheel   
  to the fork with the axle.    

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,601
    it takes just two hours     

90
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,169
    to make a mountain bike     
      suspension fork...        

91
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,875
   but they're strong enough    
    to last through many more   
             hours              

92
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,543
            on long,            
    bumpy mountain trails.      

93
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:04,763
        humans have been        
      performing surgery        

94
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,165
     for over 7,000 years,      

95
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,834
     but the use of surgical    
             sutures            
       is fairly recent.        

96
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,705
     ancient greek surgeons     
 were thought to be the first.  

97
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:15,173
     they used gut strings      

98
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,442
      to mend the wounds of     
           gladiators           

99
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,577
     over 2,000 years ago.      

100
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,583
  today's medical sutures come  
      in different forms,       

101
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:28,120
       such as synthetic        
     monofilament threads,      

102
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:31,523
   natural collagen fibers,     

103
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,060
 or braided synthetic threads.  

104
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,063
          a technician          
     sets a tension meter       

105
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,465
      to check the quality      
     of the raw materials.      

106
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,335
  the machine applies tension   
          on the knot           

107
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,138
  to measure the force needed   
         to break it.           

108
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,743
 a worker tests the material's  
      absorption process        

109
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,346
       in a heated bath.        

110
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:58,884
 this simulates the temperature 
    and moisture of the human   
             body.              

111
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,288
    a technician enters the     
        product's medical       
         specifications         

112
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,057
         and prints out         
      a batch of labels.        

113
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,230
       then, a supervisor       
        selects needles         

114
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:16,635
  and places them on a table.   

115
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:21,173
 he retrieves spools of thread  
   from a refrigerated room.    

116
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,308
    to preserve the thread,     

117
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,710
        it's been stored        
     in sealed containers.      

118
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,515
     the supervisor gathers     
       all the materials        

119
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,719
     and brings them to the     
            material            
    preparation department.     

120
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,388
    the supplies are passed     
      through an air lock       

121
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,758
  to maintain the department's  
positive-pressure environment.  

122
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,530
       on the other side,       
         a technician           

123
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,499
    opens the airtight foil     
 and removes the thread spool.  

124
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,470
     she threads the spool      

125
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,908
    in a custom-made winding    
     and cutting machine.       

126
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,826
      the technician sets       
 the mechanical thread counter  

127
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,362
          back to zero          
    and starts the winder.      

128
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,366
    it can wind threads that    
     are up to 100 inches.      

129
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,905
       the counter tracks       
    the number of windings      

130
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,841
         as the machine         
     unspools the thread.       

131
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,045
        the machine stops       
          automatically         
 once the winding is complete.  

132
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:39,050
     the technician applies     
      medical-grade glue        

133
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,786
      to stiffen the ends       
    of the braided threads      

134
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,154
     before cutting them.       

135
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,528
       she places a guide       
 to hold the threads in place   

136
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,431
      while she cuts them       
     along the glue line.       

137
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,943
      sutures use needles       
 of various shapes and sizes,   

138
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,846
    the smallest ones being     
   10 millimeters in length.    

139
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,953
 on the main production floor,  

140
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,090
    dozens of workers attach    
    needles to the threads.     

141
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,691
 they make sure the attachment  

142
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:24,562
       meets the suture's       
         requirements.          

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,199
     the operator inserts       

144
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,566
     the glue-hardened end      
         of the thread          

145
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,903
  into the back of the needle   
      and crimps it tight       

146
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,572
       with a mechanical        
       swaging machine.         

147
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,508
   then, she hooks the needle   
      into a pull tester        

148
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,110
     to check the strength      
      of each attachment.       

149
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,915
        finally, workers        
  wind the assembled sutures    

150
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,250
  into folded holding cards,    

151
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,086
     tucking the needles in     
        for protection.         

152
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,361
  a worker inserts the holding  
 card in a labeled foil pouch.  

153
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,266
       then, he slips it        
      in a second package       

154
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:05,470
     made of medical paper      
    and polypropylene film      

155
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,740
       and feeds it into        
  a continuous rotary sealer.   

156
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,277
 the sealed packages drop into  
 a production holding basket.   

157
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:20,218
  the finished product is sent  
   for terminal sterilizing.    

158
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,687
  a worker places the basket    

159
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,291
    into an ethylene oxide,     
 or eo, gas sterilization bag.  

160
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,895
          she attaches          
  a biological indicator vial   

161
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,564
      and a control strip       
   on a sterilization control   
              card              

162
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,833
       and puts the card        
        inside the bag.         

163
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:39,838
  she adds an eo gas delayed-   
  release canister in the bag   

164
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,974
   and places the sealed bag    
     into the sterilizer.       

165
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,984
      sutures can be used       

166
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,386
 for a variety of procedures,   

167
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,788
      but each product has      
  a very precise application.   

168
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,673
       harvested grains         

169
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,208
         must be dried          
  before they can be stored.    

170
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,144
   otherwise, they'll spoil.    

171
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,014
   farmers can outsource this   
              work              
   to someone else for a hefty  
              fee,              

172
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,951
   or they can choose to keep   
    everything on the farm      

173
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,320
by investing in a grain dryer.  

174
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:36,195
    to use a grain dryer, the   
             farmer             
  simply dumps their harvest    

175
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,964
    into a fold-down loading    
            hopper.             

176
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:45,370
   once the bin is full, he or  
               she              
starts the dryer's power unit.  

177
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,306
   a central auger circulates   
   the grain inside the bin     

178
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:52,377
   as a fan blows in hot air,   
       drying the grain.        

179
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,515
          most of the           
   grain dryer's components     

180
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:57,883
 are made out of steel tubing.  

181
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,558
  workers cut the tubes to the  
   various required lengths.    

182
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,931
 once all the pieces are cut,   

183
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,167
     workers position them      
      on an assembly jig.       

184
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,740
    here, they're assembling    
    the dryer's mainframe.      

185
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,346
   once all the parts are laid  
              out,              
   workers lock the pieces in   
             place              

186
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,781
    and weld them together.     

187
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,292
         they assemble          
   what's called the spider     

188
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,894
 on a different assembly jig.   

189
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,231
      the spider supports       
  the dryer's plenum chamber,   

190
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,433
         the component          
   at the center of the bin     

191
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,770
 that distributes the hot air.  

192
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,039
    workers bolt the spider     
       to the mainframe         

193
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,041
       and move the unit        
      to the paint area.        

194
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,509
    they clean and prime the    
             steel,             

195
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,113
       then, coat it with       
  corrosion-resistant paint.    

196
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,450
    it takes 24 to 32 hours     

197
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,786
     for the paint to dry.      

198
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,187
        at that point,          

199
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,991
   workers mount the agitator   
        to the spider.          

200
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,228
    the agitator prevents wet   
              grain             
from sticking to the bin wall.  

201
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,999
   they mount the agitator's    

202
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:24,503
    main drive chain to the     
 main gear and gearbox drive.   

203
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,342
   meanwhile, a plasma torch    
          cuts sheets           

204
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:35,013
 of perforated galvanized steel 
         for the bin.           

205
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,448
     these pieces will form     
     the circular bottom.       

206
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,621
     a press punches holes      
along the edges of each sheet.  

207
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:51,563
        workers connect         
      the sheets together       

208
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,166
   and bolt them onto a ring    
  called the transition band    

209
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,902
 at the top of the mainframe.   

210
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:04,910
   then, they lower the spider  
               and              
    bolt it to the transition   
             band.              

211
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:08,180
  they bolt the plenum chamber  
        to the spider.          

212
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,714
      the chamber is made       

213
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,450
         of perforated          
   galvanized steel sheets.     

214
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,986
 hot air blown into the chamber 
       by the power unit        

215
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:18,423
        exits through the       
          perforations,         
 drying the circulating grain.  

216
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,599
      next, they assemble       
    the bin's outside wall.     

217
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,669
      they bolt perforated      
           galvanized           
    steel sheets together,      

218
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:35,406
  as well as to the transition  
    band on the mainframe.      

219
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,742
     the sheets enclose the     
 plenum chamber at the center   

220
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,812
      and vent the dry air      
   through the perforations.    

221
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,748
  workers mount the power unit  
       to the mainframe.        

222
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,220
      the unit, consisting      
     of a burner and fan,       

223
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,155
         blows hot air          
   into the plenum chamber.     

224
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,561
     in another part of the     
            factory,            
 they build the loading hopper  

225
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,829
      on an assembly jig.       

226
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,701
         after welding          
      the parts together,       

227
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,504
       they clean, prime,       
     and paint the steel;       

228
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,772
       install the auger        
     that moves the grain;      

229
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,643
  then, a cover the farmer can  
 adjust to regulate the flow.   

230
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,179
          he also adds          
     a protective screen,       

231
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,649
          for safety.           

232
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,250
       then, they attach        
  the finished loading hopper   

233
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,253
   to the dryer's mainframe.    

234
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,721
          it connects           
     via a pivoting hinge       

235
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:28,993
          on the front          
     of the loading tube.       

236
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,462
   the hinge lets the farmer    
        fold the hopper         

237
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:35,066
     up and out of the way      
     when it's not in use.      

238
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,936
    workers install springs     
       to make it easier        

239
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,705
       to lower and raise       
     the 60-pound hopper.       

240
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,145
  they also install a latch,    

241
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,881
    which secures the hopper    
        against the bin         

242
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,884
 during storage or transport.   

243
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:55,020
     the grain dryer rolls      

244
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:58,556
  on wheels attached to axles   
   bolted to the mainframe.     

245
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,493
        the last step is        
      installing a ladder       

246
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,029
  on the outside of the bin.    

247
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,364
      this provides access      
 to the top of the grain dryer  

248
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:10,602
    for monitoring operation    
       and maintenance.         

249
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,184
  frying pans were first used   
    by the ancient greeks and   
             romans             

250
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,518
     over 2,000 years ago.      

251
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,854
  these wide and shallow pans   

252
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:31,322
  can be used to saut, sear,    

253
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,657
         or fry food.           

254
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,125
  water released from the food  
        during cooking          

255
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,795
 creates that sizzling sound.   

256
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,797
      the shape of the pan      
  allows steam to dissipate,    

257
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,433
 giving food a crispy finish.   

258
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,271
  a good nonstick frying pan    

259
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:49,808
   is a must in the kitchen.    

260
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,411
    a frying pan can be made    
 of any heat-conductive metal.  

261
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,880
         in this case,          
    aluminum alloy ingots.      

262
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,551
     they melt the ingots.      

263
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:03,421
    a robotic ladle scoops up   
             molten             
     aluminum to be used for    
            casting.            

264
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:07,025
  they use this two-part die    

265
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,061
  to transform liquid aluminum  
      into a frying pan.        

266
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,834
       the robotic ladle        

267
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,168
       pours the aluminum       
         into the die           

268
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,473
  through a cylindrical port.   

269
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:29,581
   this high-pressure casting   
produces a very precise shape.  

270
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,385
     after about a minute,      
   an operator takes it out.    

271
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:38,456
    they cut off the excess     
  using a computerized tool.    

272
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,858
        the table moves         
       as the tool cuts         

273
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,329
      the edge of the pan       
      to specifications.        

274
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:49,667
    a worker sands the edges    
 and rounds the rim of the pan  

275
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,937
        a little more.          

276
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:58,109
   they cast pans in several    
    sizes and thicknesses.      

277
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,883
  an employee keeps a detailed  
    inventory of the pans.      

278
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:13,425
    next, they put the pans     
  in a sand-blasting chamber.   

279
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:18,096
  the sand blaster cleans off   
       oil and residue.         

280
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,632
      it also roughens up       
    the surface of the pans     

281
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,367
 to prepare them for coating.   

282
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:28,173
   an employee scrubs off the   
              sand              
    using an abrasive pad.      

283
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:31,176
     next, the pans receive     
    their ceramic coating.      

284
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:34,312
    each pan spins on a pod     
       as a plasma flame        

285
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,982
     melts three different      
       powders onto it.         

286
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,619
  the coating protects the pan  
        from corrosion.         

287
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,458
  an employee scrubs each pan   
     with an abrasive pad       

288
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,395
    to remove the residue.      

289
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:54,165
   this time, the frying pan    
         spins slowly           

290
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,134
     as torches heat them       

291
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,406
     to approximately 175.      

292
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:06,678
  this preheat preps the pans   
    for the final coatings.     

293
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,881
    they prepare up to five     
       proprietary coating      
          formulations          

294
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,484
  for each frying pan model.    

295
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,086
    each one contains dozens    
         of chemicals           

296
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,956
     and thousands of tiny      
      diamond particles.        

297
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,225
      the diamonds increase     
           durability           
    and heat conductivity.      

298
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,961
      they also make food       

299
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,898
      less likely to stick      
  to the surface of the pan.    

300
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,901
   the final coating contains   
      a nonstick chemical       

301
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:34,038
        known as ptfe.          

302
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,574
    they spray the different    
  coatings onto the surface.    

303
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,244
      the spinning ensures      
         even coverage          

304
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,847
     as the coatings adhere     
       to the hot pans.         

305
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,653
   now, a primer is applied.    

306
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,456
      it allows the final       
       nonstick coating         

307
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,793
  to bond to the frying pan.    

308
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,463
    at the end of the line,     

309
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:02,066
    an employee inspects the    
             finish             
   and sprays a little more     

310
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,303
    of the nonstick formula     
   onto the handle fitting.     

311
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,474
    then, the frying pans go    
       through a furnace        

312
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:12,877
      to bake the coatings      
        onto the pans.          

313
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:17,815
       an employee checks       
    the finish for bubbles,     

314
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,752
           scratches,           
   or color inconsistencies.    

315
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:23,421
  once the pans have cooled,    

316
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,690
     a robot transfers them     
          to a lathe.           

317
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,025
    the lathe spins the pan     

318
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,762
      as a tool shaves off      
   a thin layer of aluminum.    

319
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,329
      this leaves a clean,      
         level surface          

320
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,833
   on the bottom of the pan.    

321
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,838
  a suctioning robot moves the  
     frying pan to the next     
            station,            

322
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,972
        where a worker          

323
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,308
 attaches a handle to the pan.  

324
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,510
    an automatic screwdriver    
          secures it.           

325
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,250
    a technician heats one      

326
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,052
     of the frying pans on a    
            cooktop             

327
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:57,655
  as a mechanical arm rubs the  
               pan              
      thousands of times        

328
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,759
      with a coarse piece       
         of sandpaper.          

329
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,266
    there are no scratches,     

330
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,935
  so the entire batch of pans   
         is approved.           

331
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,337
     thousands of nonstick      
          frying pans           

332
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,539
are ready to leave the factory  

333
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:19,043
   and cook up a tasty meal.    

334
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,221
    if you have any comments    
        about the show,         

335

    or you'd like to suggest    
   topics for future shows,
