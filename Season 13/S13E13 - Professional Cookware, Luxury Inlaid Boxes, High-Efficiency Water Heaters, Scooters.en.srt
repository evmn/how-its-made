00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,919
narrator: a quality pot and pan     

4
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,322
has the ability to heat uniformly throughout  

5
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,124
so that food cooks evenly.   

6
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:00,726
copper is by far the best heat conductor,    

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,329
but copper cookware is very expensive.       

8
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,399
aluminum conducts heat well but isn't durable.       

9
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,867
so many cooks use stainless-steel cookware    

10
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,537
that contains aluminum.    

11
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:18,410
this high-end line of stainless-steel cookware  

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,280
has an aluminum core running throughout.       

13
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,685
production begins       
with two stainless-steel sheets.

14
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,220
using a spot welder,      

15
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,390
workers tack them together along one side.        

16
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,562
then they lay the connected sheets      

17
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,564
onto an assembly fixture.   

18
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,833
a vacuum arm pulls up the top sheet,         

19
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,536
and they insert an aluminum sheet in between. 

20
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,247
this metal sandwich goes onto a conveyor      

21
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,784
that takes it on a 10-minute ride through an oven.     

22
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,787
the heat -- 700 degrees fahrenheit --   

23
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,522
softens the metal.       

24
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:08,393
this preps them for the bonding
and shaping operations to come.

25
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,130
from the oven, the metals enter the first mill,     

26
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,798
which uses electric current  

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,002
to heat and bond the three layers into one.   

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,540
now it's into a second rolling mill.     

29
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,743
this one strengthens the bond. 

30
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:27,079
that steam you see is the water-soluble lubricant 

31
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,815
evaporating against the hot metal.     

32
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,686
now the bonded metal travels to a second oven for reheating.

33
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,822
this further strengthens the bond.           

34
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,425
from there, it's into a 110-ton press.   

35
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,896
it forces down a die to cut out the starting shape 

36
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,898
of the piece of cookware they're making.        

37
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,240
they clean off any debris from the metal cutting.    

38
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,509
even a minute shard getting under the press    

39
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,879
would damage the metal.    

40
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,385
now the disk goes into a 220-ton press      

41
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,121
containing a forming tool,   

42
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,825
which forms it into the shape of a 10-inch frying pan.    

43
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,196
a sheet of paper between each shaped pan    

44
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,997
prevents scratches.      

45
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,268
they install different forming tools on the press   

46
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,537
to produce different types of cookware,          

47
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,673
from saucepans to stockpots.  

48
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,678
now that they've formed the shape,           

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,213
they need to do some refining. 

50
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,282
this trimming press first removes         

51
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,184
excess metal around the perimeter.     

52
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,760
next comes what they call edge conditioning.       

53
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,362
the perimeter trimming left the rim rough,      

54
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,831
so now they smooth it     

55
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,101
by running it against a cutter at high speed.         

56
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,906
the next stop is a polishing machine     

57
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,775
with an abrasive belt.     

58
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,177
the pan's interior surface   

59
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,913
rotates at high speed against the belt.       

60
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,383
the result is a high-gloss finish.    

61
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,486
now for the exterior.     

62
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,393
the pans go onto a rotary buffer.        

63
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,796
each pan runs against     

64
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,665
10 progressively finer buffing wheels.        

65
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,667
by the end of the circuit,   

66
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,670
the stainless steel has a mirror finish.      

67
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,216
it's time to get a handle on this cookware.       

68
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,885
first, they use a press    

69
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,620
that's essentially an industrial-strength     

70
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:48,954
hole puncher.         

71
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,058
it applies nearly 20 tons   
of force to perforate the metal.

72
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,430
workers position rivets in the holes,         

73
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,567
then use another press to squeeze them flat.      

74
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,637
as the rivets spread outward, 

75
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,573
they secure the handle firmly in place.        

76
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,480
this company's top-of-the-line stainless-steel cookware    

77
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,651
contains a copper core within the aluminum core --  

78
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,120
a structure designed specifically     

79
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:25,524
for induction cooking, the latest culinary technology.

80
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,729
a thin cut along the perimeter exposes the copper within,   

81
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,999
giving this high-end cookware a signature look.       

82
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,336
after all, performance and style are everything    

83
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:41,373
in an industry where the    
competition's always heating up.

84
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,288
narrator: for centuries,    

85
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,224
people have stored their possessions in special boxes --

86
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:03,028
jewelry chests, watch cases, music boxes.          

87
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,630
although designed for storage, 

88
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,032
they're often as beautiful and as treasured        

89
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,433
as the goods they hold --   

90
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:12,471
truly ornate, handcrafted works
of art in their own right.   

91
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,512
these wooden boxes are handcrafted and decorated 

92
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,716
with beautiful wooden inlay designs.     

93
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:27,519
to build the box structure, the carpenter uses linden,   

94
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,889
a soft wood that's ideal for carving.   

95
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:36,295
he begins by cutting slots in each end of the four sides. 

96
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,599
then he glues wooden inserts, called biscuits,        

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,869
into one side of each piece... 

98
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,739
leaving the slot on the other side empty.    

99
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,541
then he assembles the sides  

100
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,011
by fitting the biscuits of each side          

101
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,980
into the empty slot of the connecting piece.    

102
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,355
after clamping everything firmly together,        

103
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:07,226
he checks the size by tracing a template of the final shape. 

104
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,165
once the glue is dry,     

105
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:17,770
this computer-guided machine cuts the sides to that shape. 

106
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,904
the next step will be to veneer the sides  

107
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,774
with a decorative wood,    

108
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,777
such as olive, rosewood,    

109
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,513
redwood, or california burr walnut.   

110
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,317
for aesthetics, workers tape four identical sheets together 

111
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,955
so that the grain of the wood appears in mirror image.    

112
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,594
the carpenter then applies a coat of glue  

113
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,730
onto the sides of the box   

114
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:48,733
and presses on a piece of veneer.       

115
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,805
they've embellished this one  
with some inlay work beforehand.

116
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,576
he presses the veneer flat to force out any trapped air. 

117
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,883
this design calls for a black strip of bolivar wood 

118
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,319
to ornament each corner.    

119
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,356
to make the box cover,     

120
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,559
the carpenter uses a machine called a pantograph.      

121
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,296
he moves the head in the middle
over a model of the cover.   

122
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,500
this simultaneously moves routers on each side   

123
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,970
to shape a piece of wood to the same form.       

124
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,640
meanwhile, the inlayer lays a drawing         

125
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,177
of the cover's decorative design
on a stack of wood boards   

126
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,914
and cuts out inlay pieces for several covers at once.  

127
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,925
to color the edges of select pieces,        

128
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,962
the inlayer burns them in hot sand.          

129
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:57,936
some types of wood turn brown --
others, green.         

130
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:01,273
after hand-cutting the design outline in a veneer sheet,   

131
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,075
the inlayer uses tweezers   

132
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:06,578
to position the pieces of inlay
one by one.          

133
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,816
a sheet of adhesive paper underneath  

134
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,619
holds the pieces in place for now.            

135
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,703
once the design is complete,  

136
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,039
the carpenter fills the crevices
around the pieces       

137
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,508
with plaster tinted to blend in.

138
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,913
a final layer of plaster goes over the entire design  

139
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,982
to hold all the pieces in place
permanently.          

140
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,784
once the plaster hardens,   

141
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,187
he covers the entire inlaid sheet in glue,         

142
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,557
further securing the inlaid pieces.       

143
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,594
now he flips it over,     

144
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,798
then peels away the adhesive paper...     

145
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,567
and voilà.           

146
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:11,610
he glues the inlaid sheet to the box cover.       

147
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,879
pressing it down firmly is a delicate process     

148
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,815
when the cover's curved like this one.         

149
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,618
one wrong move, and crack.   

150
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,021
after lacquering the edge of the cover,     

151
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,757
workers apply four coats of high-gloss varnish     

152
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,959
to protect the wood.      

153
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,096
finally, they screw on the box bottom,        

154
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,699
mount the cover to the box with hinges,          

155
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,835
install any other hardware, such as keyholes,       

156
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:41,073
and if it's a music box, install the musical movement. 

157
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,192
narrator: conventional gas water heaters 

158
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:02,660
are only about 75% thermally efficient.    

159
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,863
but high-efficiency water heaters         

160
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,031
are up to 96% thermally efficient,    

161
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,468
meaning almost all the heat they generate         

162
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,270
gets transferred to the water. 

163
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:12,937
it's the unique heat exchanger 

164
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,841
that makes these water heaters so energy-efficient.      

165
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,482
the heat exchanger resides in the center of the unit.   

166
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,216
it's made of steel pipe    

167
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,820
that goes through a process called mandrel bending.    

168
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,356
mandrel bending prevents the 12-yard-long pipe     

169
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:35,561
from kinking as it turns into the shape of a coil.   

170
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,436
a welder fuses steel rods to the sides of the coil,   

171
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,571
making the flexible heat exchanger         

172
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,140
suitably ridged.        

173
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:55,913
next, a machine pumps a ceramic
enamel through the pipe,    

174
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,716
from the bottom up, to ensure full coverage.    

175
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,386
this coating protects the interior of the pipe    

176
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,655
against corrosion.       

177
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,058
it takes about 6 minutes    

178
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,260
to fully coat the inside of the pipe     

179
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,495
and drain the remaining liquid.

180
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,069
it takes about 15 minutes inside a furnace        

181
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,140
for the coating to cure and become rock hard.     

182
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,542
now it's time to seal the heat exchanger   

183
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,911
inside an inner tank.     

184
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,814
they first set it down on a base,           

185
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,483
then cover it with a steel enclosure.    

186
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,754
it's this inner tank that holds the hot water.   

187
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,228
the tank then goes into a vertical press     

188
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,831
that pushes it down onto the base.         

189
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,170
a computerized arc-welding machine      

190
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,206
welds the tank together.    

191
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,579
a technician then pressurizes the tank with air,       

192
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,781
and, using water, he checks for leaks      

193
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,250
until he's satisfied there are none.        

194
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,125
he then pumps ceramic enamel into the tank,         

195
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,726
and a tumble-coating machine  

196
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,328
shakes up the corrosion-resistant enamel,

197
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,664
fully coating the inside of the tank     

198
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,035
as well as the outside of the heat exchanger.     

199
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,276
a technician then inserts cold-water inlet tubes     

200
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,613
into each tank.        

201
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,748
he also inserts aluminum anode rods      

202
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,950
to help protect the inside of the unit     

203
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,886
by absorbing corrosive elements
in the water          

204
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,955
before they can attack the steel tank.        

205
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,290
after attaching all the plumber's fittings,  

206
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,426
he installs a second anode rod 

207
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,197
that gives the tanks double corrosion protection.  

208
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,840
now they put on what's called a rolling foam stop      

209
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,575
that helps them fit a painted jacket over the shell

210
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,945
and maintain it in place.   

211
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,849
here, they attach the gas valve

212
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,285
that is used to light the burner.          

213
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,962
a painted cover then goes on the top of the jacket.   

214
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,800
they connect a blower to the tank.          

215
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,269
the blower is what expels the burner's spent gases    

216
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,839
to the outside air.      

217
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:43,214
the next step is to hook up a burner to the gas valve.   

218
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,083
this burner is what heats the air     

219
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,085
that goes through the heat exchanger,      

220
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,956
which, in turn, transfers its heat to the water.     

221
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,426
a technician now fills the cavity      

222
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,095
between the inner shell and outer jacket        

223
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,599
with high-density expanding foam.        

224
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,504
this foam insulation is about 2 inches thick    

225
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:08,039
and goes all around the circumference of the tank 

226
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,842
to prevent heat loss.     

227
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,244
the unit then gets a cosmetic cover        

228
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,347
that conceals the blower.   

229
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,621
finally, a technician hooks up and tests each unit.      

230
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,925
he follows strict quality-control standards   

231
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,994
which guarantee that the burner

232
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,129
and all the fittings and connections        

233
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,798
are working properly.     

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,835
only then is the unit ready for shipping.      

235
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,872
high-efficiency water heaters 

236
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,208
can deliver all the hot water you need   

237
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,011
and save you money while they're at it.      

238
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,828
narrator: the motor scooter as we know it         

239
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,297
hit the streets just after world war ii.    

240
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,434
europe was rebuilding its devastated infrastructure, 

241
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,770
and the scooter offered affordable transportation   

242
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,838
at this critical time.     

243
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,307
so in a small way,       

244
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,442
it helped put the postwar economy      

245
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,911
on the road to recovery.    

246
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,384
many decades after it was first introduced, 

247
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,386
the scooter is still big on the streets,        

248
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:32,657
and the uncertain cost of fuel is one reason why.       

249
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,864
production begins with a step-through chassis.  

250
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,334
it's often built on a tubular frame.      

251
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:46,171
but at this factory, they have a unique approach.  

252
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,742
robots join three pieces of molded steel together    

253
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:54,879
by executing hundreds of precision welds.      

254
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,616
this transforms the three molded pieces    

255
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,918
into one solid chassis.    

256
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,888
after rustproofing and priming,

257
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,359
the chassis gets a paint job and a clear protective veneer. 

258
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,263
they cure the finish by baking it on.        

259
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,935
then they polish away any imperfections.       

260
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,373
the chassis moves down the line,

261
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,777
where a technician installs its radiator system.      

262
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,183
the next assembler clamps the radiator's wiring and hoses

263
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,120
to the vehicle framework.   

264
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:39,357
some plastic edging helps define
the lines of the scooter.   

265
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,531
this model receives a 4-stroke,
150cc engine,         

266
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,934
which will make this scooter a bit more peppy than some.   

267
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:53,138
it also has an automatic transmission.   

268
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,547
once the rear wheel has been installed,      

269
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,950
the worker hoists the engine over to the chassis.      

270
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,487
he guides it into place just behind the passenger seat 

271
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,490
and then bolts it to the steel framework.    

272
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,361
next up is the steering column 

273
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,931
with the front brakes and wheel hub already attached.

274
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,301
the technician assembles it to a front fender...      

275
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,772
...then inserts the steering column in its slot

276
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,742
at the front of the scooter body.      

277
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,847
securing it is a delicate business.    

278
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,515
he tightens this special tool 

279
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,917
to gently squeeze the assembly together.     

280
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,321
this technique prevents damage to the components.       

281
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,858
the handlebar is loosely screwed
into place for now       

282
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,327
but will be properly tightened down later.     

283
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:01,539
this scooter's front wheel has a 12-inch rim.       

284
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,276
that's quite a bit bigger than those on early scooters. 

285
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,879
the bigger wheels add stability

286
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,146
and allow this scooter     

287
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,549
to reach a higher speed than its forerunners.     

288
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,953
to illuminate the road ahead, 

289
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,089
this 2-wheeler will need a headlight.     

290
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,392
it mounts onto the handlebar. 

291
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,563
a technician then puts this scooter to the test.   

292
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,633
she checks the headlight and all the signal lights.   

293
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,510
she engages the motor and throttles up        

294
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,647
to check both wheels and the speed gauges.     

295
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,984
once it gets the okay,     

296
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,987
a worker installs the cover on the horn     

297
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:52,724
and then accessorizes     
the scooter with pieces of trim.

298
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,796
and now they install the scooter's saddle      

299
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,899
on a hinge over a storage compartment.  

300
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,540
another buff and polish makes this machine gleam.   

301
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,279
the worker then installs pop-out footrests       

302
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,047
for the passenger.       

303
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,084
after one last shine,     

304
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,553
it's over to the quality inspector.   

305
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,556
that's the lady in yellow.   

306
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,959
she scrutinizes the vehicle from all angles.        

307
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,364
and when she gives it the green light,        

308
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,801
this scooter is ready to merge with traffic.     

309
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,173
life on the street can be tough,

310
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,977
but this design has had a lot of road testing over the years,

311
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,447
and that's what makes the motor scooter a classic.  

312
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,395
if you have any comments about the show,        

313
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,398
or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows,

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,367
