captions paid for by discovery communications     

3
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,122
narrator: a sidecar is a passenger attachment    

4
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:57,856
that bolts to a motorcycle.   

5
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:01,060
sidecars are aftermarket products,    

6
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,796
meaning a separate company -- not the motorcycle maker --   

7
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,132
manufactures and markets them.  

8
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,304
you buy a model that's compatible with your motorcycle.           

9
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,210
a motorcycle sidecar carries one passenger or two,      

10
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,813
if they're small children or pets.             

11
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,815
manufacturers typically produce several models,         

12
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,153
designed to fit the most popular bikes on the market.       

13
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:30,088
this one has a fiberglass body,              

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,025
surrounded by a steel perimeter chassis.        

15
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,293
workers construct the chassis  

16
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,230
using several sections of steel tubing.         

17
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,498
they form each section      

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,900
to the required shape on a hydraulic bender,      

19
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,103
measuring as they go.      

20
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,372
there are sections in the front and back,      

21
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,674
along the sides, and underneath.           

22
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,515
once the sections are each bent to specifications,        

23
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,784
workers clamp them into a jig,  

24
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,187
which aligns them all in the correct configuration.  

25
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,323
the smaller-diameter sections  

26
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,659
fit into adjoining larger-diameter ones.      

27
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:16,468
once all the parts are in    
position, a welder fuses them.  

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,304
the structure of the perimeter chassis is now complete     

29
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,807
and ready for a coat of baked-on powder paint     

30
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,676
to prevent the steel from rusting.          

31
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,813
next, workers mount the suspension          

32
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,748
and wheel to the chassis,    

33
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,551
then install a fiberglass mudguard      

34
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:37,022
that has a reflector, a taillight, and a turn signal.             

35
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,625
they make the sidecar's fiberglass body         

36
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,560
with upper and lower molds,   

37
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,562
first painting each one with gel coat,          

38
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,230
a polyester resin        

39
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,568
that creates a smooth and shiny surface over fiberglass.     

40
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,172
when the gel coat dries, about 45 minutes later,     

41
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,441
they lay fiberglass mat over it,               

42
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,977
then saturate the fiberglass with resin.           

43
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,180
they lay two fiberglass layers in most parts of the mold    

44
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,850
and a few extra layers in areas that need a bit more strength  

45
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,986
to support attached components.           

46
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,388
in the lower mold,        

47
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,857
they re-enforce the floor with plywood           

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,327
and, in specific locations, bond in steel mounting plates  

49
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,931
for bolting components to the fiberglass later on.   

50
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:23,268
24 hours later, once the resin has cured,    

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,805
they extract the upper- and lower-body halves      

52
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,674
from their respective molds, trim the rough edges,      

53
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,943
and join the halves on the inside          

54
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,745
with more fiberglass and resin.             

55
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,281
then they place the now-assembled body      

56
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,617
inside the perimeter chassis to check the alignment.     

57
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,687
but they don't connect the chassis just yet.      

58
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,224
first, to snazz up the body, they mount a nose badge     

59
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:48,360
made of stainless steel and anodized aluminum.      

60
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:53,766
then they attach aluminum strips to the nose badge,        

61
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:56,869
affixing them to the fiberglass with rivets.           

62
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,308
they gently tap the strips with a mallet,          

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,910
shaping them to the contour of the body.           

64
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:13,052
then they set a rubber insert into each strip.         

65
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,826
this adds a decorative touch, while hiding the rivets.     

66
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,405
next, the sidecar's windscreen.           

67
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,608
it's made of polycarbonate,   

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,744
an ultra-thin yet strong type of plastic,           

69
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,647
encased in a durable aluminum frame.         

70
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:49,021
they finish off the body by installing carpeting     

71
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,656
and an upholstered vinyl seat.  

72
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,227
workers position the sidecar   

73
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,430
so that its wheel is turned slightly inward.    

74
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:03,435
this ensures the bike and sidecar handle correctly.  

75
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,704
then they bolt the chassis to the bike frame        

76
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,106
with four steel arms --     

77
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,375
two at the front and two at the back.       

78
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,977
next they fit a steering damper.             

79
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,046
this prevents the sidecar    

80
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,449
from causing a wobble in the steering.         

81
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,784
the final step is to connect the electrical wiring      

82
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,122
to the lights and the mudguard.            

83
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:26,625
the perimeter chassis is now ready to receive the body.    

84
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,998
they thread bolts into the holes of those mounting plates     

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that were bonded in with the fiberglass       

86
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,936
during the molding process --  

87
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:40,706
two bolts at the front and two at the back, through the floor.             

88
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,477
with that, this motorcycle sidecar     

89
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,246
is ready to hit the road.    

90
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,765
narrator: love french toast for breakfast          

91
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,567
but don't have the time or patience           

92
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,969
to make it from scratch?     

93
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:13,238
that's why there's ready-made frozen french toast       

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,841
that you simply pop into the toaster --       

95
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,978
no cracking eggs, pouring milk, or dipping bread required.    

96
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,481
just pour on the syrup and enjoy.            

97
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,986
a breakfast favorite for generations,         

98
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,123
it's easy to get sentimental about french toast.       

99
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,459
to get that traditional taste without the traditional mess,  

100
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,195
there's frozen french toast.   

101
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:39,264
they go from your freezer to your breakfast table     

102
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,366
in just minutes.         

103
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,672
french toast starts with freshly baked bread.    

104
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,541
a local bakery supplies this factory           

105
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,511
with custom-made 16-inch-long loaves.       

106
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:03,155
when those fresh-baked loaves arrive,    

107
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,758
workers load them horizontally onto a conveyor belt.      

108
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,094
the belt winds its way to the first machine       

109
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,363
on the production line -- the slicer.           

110
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,099
the slicer has several vertical blades,         

111
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,769
crossed in a figure eight over two drums that drive them.              

112
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:22,041
because each blade crisscrosses, it cuts two slices at once.   

113
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,046
for this production run,     

114
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:30,249
the slicer cuts each loaf into 28 slices          

115
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,251
almost half an inch thick.    

116
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,792
at the output end of the slicer,             

117
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,861
workers discard the two end pieces.       

118
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,530
however, these heels, as    
they're called, aren't wasted.  

119
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,766
they're used for animal feed.  

120
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:54,540
workers load the cut loaves into              
side-by-side vertical columns.  

121
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:02,214
the slices drop down onto a wire conveyor belt.    

122
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:06,151
the spacing between rows and  
slices is perfectly positioned  

123
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,487
to align with the upcoming stations,   

124
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,224
which will transform them from bread to frozen french toast.  

125
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,834
first, the slicer enters the batter station,       

126
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,103
which bathes their underside   

127
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,841
in a mixture of eggs, milk, water, and sugar.        

128
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,713
the slices then pass under a batter waterfall,    

129
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,283
which thoroughly coats their top surface.        

130
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,661
the slices exit the batter station onto a wire belt,    

131
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,798
which feeds them        
onto cast-iron griddle plates.  

132
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,004
gas flames underneath heat the plates         

133
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,206
to 275 degrees fahrenheit.    

134
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,743
after several seconds, the underside is cooked,     

135
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:09,147
and a row of automated spatulas,           
appropriately called flippers,  

136
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,985
turns the slices over to cook the reverse side.    

137
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,493
seconds later, the fully cooked french toast slices       

138
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:24,096
are removed from the griddle plates...    

139
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,302
...and deposited onto a conveyor belt.      

140
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,310
all of the single-file conveyors            

141
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,846
now converge on a larger conveyor belt,          

142
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:44,516
which transports the slices into the freezer.        

143
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,520
the temperature inside --    
negative 4 degrees fahrenheit.  

144
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,123
after a frosty 23-minute ride,  

145
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,993
the french toast is completely frozen.      

146
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,795
it exits the freezer,      

147
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,666
ready to be sorted into packaging portions.     

148
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:05,137
for this order, workers stack the slices in fours.       

149
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,006
each package will contain two stacks.     

150
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:16,548
the packaging machine inserts each portion       

151
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,585
into a continuous plastic-film pouch.       

152
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,893
then, at both ends of each portion,         

153
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,829
it simultaneously heat-seals the film       

154
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,931
and cuts the pouch free.     

155
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,369
an automated arm picks up each pouch and inserts it,    

156
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,107
either into small retail cartons destined for supermarkets    

157
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:47,512
or into large boxes       
for bulk orders to cafeterias,  

158
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,248
hospital kitchens, and restaurants.         

159
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,784
all packaging, warehousing, and shipping           

160
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,520
occurs in temperature-controlled facilities            

161
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,656
to keep the product frozen    

162
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,426
until it's time to toast this breakfast tradition.    

163
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,543
narrator: behind every chilled beverage, there's a compressor,           

164
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,013
a crucial component in refrigeration systems.    

165
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,216
it pressurizes and pumps refrigerant to the condenser   

166
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,219
so the cooling process can begin.            

167
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,554
with a well-functioning compressor,           

168
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:33,125
a refrigerator is more likely to keep its cool.        

169
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,298
behind the glossy exterior   
of a supermarket refrigerator,  

170
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,435
there's a substantial compressor doing its part          

171
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,437
to chill the merchandise.    

172
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,039
they often remanufacture old compressors         

173
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,907
to save resources and money.   

174
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,244
they immerse the cast-iron body in a chemical bath        

175
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,848
to remove the grime and rinse off the residue with hot water.             

176
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,987
that old compressor already looks a lot less tired.     

177
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:06,124
a worker polishes the cylinder bore with an abrasive pad    

178
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,993
attached to an air drill.    

179
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,929
he sands the surfaces around the openings       

180
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,132
so that all the parts will fit without leaking.         

181
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,336
smaller parts bounce around in a vibratory bowl       

182
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:21,273
with steel pellets and cleaning compound for a good scouring.  

183
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,742
out of the bowl, a worker places a valve plate          

184
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,613
on a magnetized turntable to keep it in one place,     

185
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,283
as a grinder smoothes the surface.      

186
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,951
this makes it look new.     

187
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,891
he screws two new valves to the plate.          

188
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,160
these valves will open and close              

189
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,763
to move refrigerant in and out of the compressor.        

190
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,708
the next worker assembles the terminal plate        

191
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,843
for the compressor's electrical motor.        

192
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,047
most of the components have been reconditioned,     

193
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,449
including the lugs for the wires.          

194
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,587
he slots the lugs in the terminal plate from the back   

195
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,924
and flips the plate around.   

196
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,628
he slides new rubber seals onto all the lugs...       

197
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,068
...and then installs rubber insulators and metal washers.  

198
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,872
he secures the lugs with screws,             

199
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,608
using a precisely calibrated torque wrench.          

200
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,483
the compressor's original crankshaft       

201
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,085
has also been thoroughly cleaned.       

202
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,987
as it now spins in a chuck,   

203
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,023
a worker polishes it until it's completely smooth.  

204
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,760
this will allow bearings and connecting rods       

205
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,195
to operate efficiently.     

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,668
he measures the shaft to confirm that the circumference is right.             

207
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,639
with many parts now reconditioned        

208
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,841
and partially assembled,     

209
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,444
they're ready to reconstruct the compressor.         

210
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:11,049
the worker installs new bearings            
and the refurbished crankshaft  

211
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,984
into the compressor body.    

212
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:17,055
he inserts the connecting-rod and piston assemblies.      

213
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,723
moved by the crankshaft,     

214
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,927
these pistons will compress the refrigerant gas       

215
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:26,197
to pump it through the system.  

216
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,001
he slides the rotor part of   
the motor into the compressor,  

217
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,470
and it links up to the crankshaft.        

218
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,274
he aligns the rotor to the crankshaft with a long pin.              

219
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,478
he secures the rotor to the hub with a substantial bolt.     

220
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,748
the next part is the stator.   

221
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,484
it's the magnetized mechanism  

222
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,888
that drives the rotor and, subsequently, the crankshaft.  

223
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:59,297
he connects protruding wires to               
the lugs on the terminal board  

224
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,866
we saw reassembled earlier.   

225
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,839
he sets the terminal board flush to the compressor        

226
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,740
and bolts it to it.       

227
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,046
he fits the valve plate on the cylinders,        

228
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,416
adjacent to the terminal plate.             

229
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,855
he places the cylinder head over the valve plate       

230
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,457
and bolts it to it.       

231
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,294
the remanufacture of this compressor is complete.            

232
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:37,869
to test the compressor, they pump dry nitrogen through it.  

233
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,406
a machine measures the suction and discharge pressure,     

234
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,908
as well as the electrical draw.              

235
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,145
and still running dry nitrogen through it,           

236
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,347
they immerse the compressor in water             

237
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,950
and check for bubbles that would indicate leaks.    

238
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,021
they make repairs if needed   

239
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:59,290
and then spray the compressor with enamel paint        

240
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,892
to protect it from rust.     

241
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,095
remanufacturing this refrigeration compressor     

242
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,430
has taken 24 hours.       

243
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,867
it's given it a whole new lease on life.             

244
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,452
narrator: an engine       

245
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,521
naturally takes in air from the atmosphere       

246
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,122
to burn the fuel with oxygen.  

247
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,858
if you're looking to give your car a boost,        

248
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,527
a supercharger compresses air  

249
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,796
and force-feeds it into the engine.         

250
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,999
the increased mass of oxygen burns more fuel,         

251
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,068
giving the engine more power.  

252
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,675
a supercharger is particularly popular in drag-car racing.   

253
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,012
it attaches with a belt to the engine's crankshaft,   

254
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,548
and, voil, the car's on steroids.           

255
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,283
they begin with a plate     

256
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,085
that forms the rear of the supercharger's aluminum housing.            

257
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:05,223
using a press that applies several tons of pressure,    

258
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,692
they install two steel ball bearings.     

259
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,826
these will enable        

260
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,296
the supercharger's two rotors to spin,             

261
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,499
which is what compresses air  
and forces it into the engine.  

262
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,038
after bolting the steel cap over each bearing,        

263
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,173
workers insert steel dowels into holes            

264
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,375
along the perimeter of the plate.          

265
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,912
these dowels, which they now fully seat with the press,    

266
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,616
will align with receiving holes on the adjoining housings.    

267
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,523
they take the plate that forms the front end of the housing   

268
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,926
and press a steel ball bearing into it.             

269
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,329
this bearing will enable    
the supercharger's input shaft  

270
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,066
to rotate and, by doing so, spin the rotors.         

271
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,937
they press a rubber-lip seal on top of the bearing      

272
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,140
to keep oil in and dirt out.   

273
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,548
next, they apply a retaining clip         

274
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,550
to hold the seal in position.  

275
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,326
using the press, they seat the clip in its groove.     

276
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,498
next, they insert the input shaft.         

277
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,702
its flanged end will protrude out of the supercharger,     

278
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,972
where a belt and pulley will rotate it          

279
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:29,040
so that it turns gears which spin the rotors.      

280
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,512
a computer-guided mill      

281
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,616
machines each rotor out of extruded aluminum.      

282
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,594
once both rotors are ready,   

283
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:53,197
workers take the central section of the supercharger housing   

284
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,600
and apply sealant to one end of it.        

285
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,875
they affix the rear plate    

286
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,046
containing the two bearings for the rotors.         

287
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,619
they secure the plate to the main housing       

288
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,354
using socket-headed screws,   

289
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:18,556
which they tighten with an air driver.       

290
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,494
flipping the housing to the other side now,      

291
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,830
they install the first of the two rotors,        

292
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,433
inserting its shaft into the first bearing      

293
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,236
in the just-attached rear plate.             

294
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,504
then they install the second rotor,        

295
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,509
inserting its shaft into the second bearing in the plate.             

296
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,979
the second rotor lies perpendicular to the first.   

297
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,314
this positioning allows the spinning rotors       

298
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,584
to capture air at the top of the housing, compress it,   

299
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,720
and force it downward to the bottom of the housing.  

300
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,790
they close up the housing with another plate        

301
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,993
which also contains bearings for the rotor shafts.      

302
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,931
however, on this end, the shafts protrude beyond the bearings   

303
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:03,434
in order to receive gears.    

304
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,736
then to this, they'll attach the housing           

305
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,539
containing the input shaft,   

306
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,607
which, driven by the belt and pulley,           

307
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,077
rotates these gears to spin the rotors.       

308
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,947
before continuing further,    

309
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,750
the team puts the supercharger through a performance test.   

310
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,552
the machine, called a dynamometer,      

311
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,288
assesses the ratio of speed to air flow           

312
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,224
to ensure the rotors are compressing air       

313
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,626
the way they should be      

314
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,696
and therefore outputting the required boost.       

315
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,499
if the rotors pass the test with flying colors,       

316
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:38,036
workers then hand-polish the aluminum housing       

317
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,770
to a shiny finish.        

318
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,373
a key component in the supercharger       

319
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,975
is a feeler gauge --       

320
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,978
that fan-shaped part shown on the lower left.     

321
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,648
it ensures that the distance  
between the rotors is correct,  

322
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,652
which is critical, because if the rotors are too far apart,  

323
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,687
they don't compress air adequately.           

324
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,324
and if they're too close together, they jam.       

325
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:02,459
it's the customer who, when installing the supercharger,   

326
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,997
attaches a pulley to the end of the input shaft,       

327
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,932
then a belt onto the pulley.   

328
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,333
the other end of the belt    

329
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,736
loops around the car engine's crankshaft pulley,        

330
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,005
connecting the supercharger to the engine          

331
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,940
for a mega boost of power.    

332
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,510
