00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,922
  narrator: if you suffer from  
  osteoarthritis of the knee,   

2
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,524
   your doctor might prescribe  
          a knee brace.         

3
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,726
         osteoarthritis         
      is when the cartilage     

4
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,995
    cushioning the knee joint   
           wears out,           

5
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,798
    causing bone to painfully   
          rub on bone.          

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,400
        a brace relieves        
        some of that pain       

7
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,371
 by realigning the leg to shift 
   weight off the knee joint.   

8
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,743
   this dual-action knee brace  
        rotates the foot,       

9
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,412
   which moves the thighbone,   
           the femur,           

10
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,150
    off the most painful area   
   of the shinbone, the tibia.  

11
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,086
  it also creates what's called 
         a distraction,         

12
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:29,821
   pulling the femur and tibia  
         slightly apart         

13
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,425
    to further reduce stress    
          on the joint.         

14
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:35,494
    the brace is custom-made    
        for each patient.       

15
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,297
       an orthotist takes       
        the measurements        

16
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,100
   by passing a sophisticated   
           3-d scanner          

17
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,637
  approximately 12 inches above 
       and below the knee.      

18
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,774
 the scanner translates the data
    into a 3-d computer image   

19
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,377
    with highly specialized     
    medical-device software,    

20
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,181
   then processes that image    
   into anatomical blueprints   

21
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,450
        for a 3-d model.        

22
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,986
          the computer          
      then reads the plans      

23
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:03,656
 and guides this carving machine
       to create the model      

24
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,192
          from a block          
      of high-density foam.     

25
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:09,962
       the carving process      
     takes about 10 minutes.    

26
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:16,268
 the finished model is an exact 
 replica of the patient's leg,  

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,304
    which technicians now use   
      to construct a brace      

28
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,507
that fits the patient perfectly.

29
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,411
    after wrapping the model    
         in plastic film        

30
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,012
     to protect the surface     

31
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:30,482
 and marking the main anatomical
     landmarks of the knee,     

32
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,351
   they lay a thick foam band   
         over the tibia         

33
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,688
        and begin marking       
      where they'll install     

34
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,223
  the two articulation hinges,  

35
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,359
    which rotate the foot and   
  distract the femur and tibia. 

36
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,228
        this template is        
     for the lateral hinge,     

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,764
      the primary rotator.      

38
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,566
          it's situated         
   on the outside of the leg.   

39
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:51,704
  next, taking an aluminum bar  
and bending it on special tools,

40
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:55,040
      the technicians form      
  the brace's tibial crossbar,  

41
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,644
 the band that crosses the shin 
    and holds the two hinges.   

42
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,980
the foam band takes up the space
      of a silicone lining      

43
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,784
       that will go under       
     the tibial crossbar --     

44
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,786
 critical cushioning to prevent 
         pressure points        

45
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,655
 that can cause skin irritation.

46
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,257
       once the cross bar       
         fits perfectly,        

47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,059
    they reapply the template   

48
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,730
      and mark where rivets     
 will attach the lateral hinge. 

49
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:22,200
      then, using the same      
      metal bending tools       

50
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,269
they used to shape the crossbar,

51
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:28,007
they contour the hinge to follow
      the shape of the leg.     

52
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,745
  they attach the lateral hinge 
     to the tibial crossbar     

53
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,212
       with copper rivets.      

54
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,948
     copper is a soft metal,    

55
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,752
     so they can compact it     
    to produce a solid joint,   

56
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,755
 which won't loosen up over time
       with repeated use.       

57
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,357
        at the other end        
        of the crossbar,        

58
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,628
  they affix the medial hinge,  
 which produces the distraction.

59
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,430
   when the knee is extended,   

60
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,901
 this hinge lengthens the brace 
by approximately 3/4 of an inch,

61
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,904
        pulling the tibia       
    and femur slightly apart    

62
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,372
       to eliminate pain.       

63
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,908
       it's time to mold        
       the plastic shell,       

64
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,512
   the upper part of the brace  
    that fits onto the thigh.   

65
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,382
 first, they soften a foam sheet
    in a low-temperature oven   

66
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,250
  and wrap it around the model. 

67
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,053
     this takes up the space    
      of the fabric lining      

68
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,122
 that will go under the plastic.

69
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,325
     after covering the foam    
    in a cotton heat barrier,   

70
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,128
   they soften a plastic sheet  
          in the oven,          

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,796
    wrap it around the model,   

72
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:28,066
    staple the ends together,   

73
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,802
 then coat the surface in talc, 

74
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,204
   which prevents their gloves  
          from sticking         

75
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,605
    when they apply pressure.   

76
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,808
     once the plastic cools,    

77
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,945
  they trace the shell's shape  
         and cut it out.        

78
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,948
       then, they wrap it       
  in a protective vinyl finish, 

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,951
      heating the material      
    so that it becomes sticky   

80
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,653
   and adheres to the plastic.  

81
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,627
         they also wrap         
  the tibial crossbar in vinyl. 

82
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,834
     then they apply a strip    
   of velcro to the underside,  

83
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,670
       where they'll later      
         adhere padding.        

84
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:11,643
 they install a cover over each 
 hinge to protect the mechanism.

85
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,914
  then they cut a fabric lining 
for the upper part of the brace.

86
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,717
    it adheres to the plastic   
           with velcro          

87
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,253
     so that it's removable     
           for washing          

88
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,422
       or for replacement       
         when worn out.         

89
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,759
 the brace applies the greatest 
       amount of pressure       

90
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,261
     at the tibial crossbar,    

91
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,664
 so they line the crossbar with 
 silicone padding for comfort.  

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,967
        the pad attaches        
      to the velcro strip.      

93
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:41,006
  the brace fastens to the leg  
  with three adjustable straps  

94
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,076
  and works only when the knee  
          is extended,          

95
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:47,580
  which is when osteoarthritic  
       pain hits the most.      

96
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,067
            narrator:           
  the ductless air conditioner, 

97
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,868
 invented in japan in the 1970s,

98
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,004
        transforms homes        
        into cool spaces.       

99
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,740
      this system consists      
     of an outside condenser    

100
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,876
 and refrigerant lines that run 
      to a fan in the wall.     

101
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,878
   in homes without ductwork,   

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,015
      it provides cooling       
      without renovations.      

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
         no central air?        

104
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:31,023
   ductless air conditioners,   
   also known as mini-splits,   

105
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,958
       are a cool option.       

106
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:39,564
 to manufacture the condenser,  
 they start with copper tubing. 

107
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,167
         it will be used        
        to make the coils       

108
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,170
     that cool and condense     
        the refrigerant.        

109
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,774
   a machine unwinds six reels  
    of tubing simultaneously    

110
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,710
 and pulls them between rollers.

111
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,979
    they iron out the kinks.    

112
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:58,984
 little rotating knives cut the 
 tubing to the correct length.  

113
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:02,721
the cut tubes exit into a device

114
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,057
         that bends them        
       around a mandrill.       

115
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:17,469
   this creates hairpin bends   
   in the center of each tube,  

116
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:21,740
     and they end up looking    
   like big copper bobby pins.  

117
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:32,084
    next, a sheet of aluminum   
  feeds into a progressive die. 

118
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:39,491
  a press moves up and down to  
  drive the metal into the die. 

119
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,959
        with each stroke,       

120
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,830
     the aluminum is shaped     
   into a part known as a fin.  

121
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,632
      they'll use a hundred     
          or more fins          

122
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,834
  in one air conditioner coil.  

123
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,806
 the fins fall out of the press 
        into neat stacks.       

124
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,444
   a worker slides metal rods   
         into the stacks        

125
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,846
    to maintain the alignment   
           of the fins          

126
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,382
   and adds a steel end plate.  

127
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:06,518
         she now inserts        
    the hairpin copper tubing   

128
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,587
  following a precise pattern.  

129
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,856
   the fins will act as a kind  
      of web for the tubes.     

130
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,460
    they're an important part   
          of the coil,          

131
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,995
          allowing heat         
    from the refrigerant gas    

132
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,999
 to be dissipated more quickly. 

133
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,335
 next, a press drives mandrills 
         into the tubes,        

134
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:27,006
  expanding them so they'll fit 
      tighter to the fins.      

135
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,809
the coil has really taken shape.

136
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,277
      at the next station,      

137
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,647
  they load it into a hydraulic 
        bending machine.        

138
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:42,855
it bends one section of the coil
      around a metal form.      

139
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,494
   this gives the coil a more   
   curved profile on one side   

140
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:51,764
         so it will fit         
  in the condensing unit later. 

141
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,872
     they close the open end    
       of the copper tubes      

142
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,508
     with u-bend connectors.    

143
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,311
  they brace the connectors to  
 the tubes for a leakproof fit. 

144
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,717
  this ductless air conditioner 
      coil is now complete.     

145
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,521
    they're ready to test it    
           for leaks.           

146
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:18,924
       a technician pumps       
  compressed air into the unit  

147
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,659
    to simulate refrigerant.    

148
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,528
    by using compressed air,    
    they're playing it safe,    

149
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,430
   because unlike refrigerant,  

150
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:29,067
 it won't damage the environment
 if they're actually is a leak. 

151
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,937
      once the coil is full     
       of compressed air,       

152
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,007
 he immerses the part in water. 

153
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,578
 air bubbling out would indicate
    a leak that needs fixing.   

154
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,350
  a worker keeps a close watch  
          on each coil          

155
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,853
         as it floats by        
      for signs of trouble.     

156
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,358
  they're now ready to assemble 
      the entire condenser.     

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,761
 the team screws the compressor 
          to the base.          

158
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,430
      they install the coil     

159
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,633
   and attach a motor and fans  
    to cool the refrigerant.    

160
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,106
          the next part         
      is the filter dryer.      

161
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,976
      it contains chemicals     
       to remove moisture       

162
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,778
  and filter out contaminants.  

163
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,581
     they install the wiring    
        and control panel       

164
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,917
       for the compressor       
         and fan motor.         

165
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,787
   the team connects the pump   
           to the coil          

166
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,990
       to suction out air       
   and create a vacuum inside,  

167
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:28,760
 creating a perfect environment 
    for the refrigerant gas.    

168
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,931
  he closes the service valves  

169
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,134
     and sends the ductless     
     air-conditioning unit      

170
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,404
 down the production line to be 
    charged with refrigerant.   

171
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,010
   after that, all that's left  

172
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,147
        is the packaging        
      and the installation.     

173
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,283
          on a hot day,         

174
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:55,220
  all the consumer needs to do  
   is grab the remote control   

175
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:58,290
          and activate          
  the ductless air conditioner  

176
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,758
       for some cool air.       

177
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,243
            narrator:           
     developed in the 1960s,    

178
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,313
    window film is a product    
   with transparent benefits.   

179
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,249
     applied to the windows     
   of vehicles and buildings,   

180
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,918
 this tinted film lets light in 

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,854
     while shutting out some    
   of the sun's harmful rays.   

182
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,456
  and depending on the darkness 
          of the tint,          

183
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,792
   it also provides a measure   
           of privacy.          

184
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,264
       tinted window film       
         allows drivers         

185
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,934
          to see things         
      in a different light,     

186
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,602
         one that can be        
        a lot less harsh.       

187
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,606
    not only does the tinting   
      mean less squinting,      

188
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,941
         it also reduces        
       the amount of heat       

189
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,344
         that permeates         
      the vehicle's cabin.      

190
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:57,682
 this film will also hold glass 
    together if it shatters.    

191
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,086
 because dark tints can make it 
       hard for the driver      

192
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,088
 to see the road or to be seen, 

193
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,891
    the use of window film is   
regulated in many jurisdictions.

194
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,494
          the laws vary         
    depending on the region,    

195
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,364
      so the factory makes      
     different window films     

196
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,700
      for different markets     
        and applications.       

197
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:21,707
 there are numerous formulations
    for the tinted coatings.    

198
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,443
          it all starts         
    with the acrylic adhesive   

199
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,712
    that will hold the layers   
    of plastic film together.   

200
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,449
  the adhesive will also serve  
           as the base          

201
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:33,851
          for the tint          
      and other additives.      

202
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,189
      the technician thins      
   the adhesive with solvent,   

203
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:41,360
  which will make it easier to  
 blend in the other ingredients.

204
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,265
        those ingredients       
        include chemicals       

205
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,368
  to absorb ultraviolet rays... 

206
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,475
     ...initiators to make      
     the mix cure faster...     

207
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,477
    and finally the colorant.   

208
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,346
       it's carbon-based,       
        and as a result,        

209
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,616
       it's highly soluble      
       and disperses well.      

210
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,620
    achieving the right shade   
           of colorant          

211
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,556
   is truly an exact science,   

212
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,559
   one that started beforehand  
           in the lab.          

213
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,562
      a technician mixed up     
          test batches          

214
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:21,433
   combining one or more dyes   
     with the adhesive base     

215
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,303
         until satisfied        
        with the results.       

216
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,105
        once the adhesive       
         has been mixed,        

217
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,642
  they add a chemical catalyst  
         to activate it.        

218
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,311
        they're now ready       
      for the plastic film.     

219
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,980
    there are various grades    
        and thicknesses.        

220
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,316
          the type used         
       depends on the type      

221
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,652
         of window film         
       being manufactured.      

222
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,855
        the plastic film        
      unwinds over rollers      

223
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,923
    into the coating machine.   

224
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,325
        at the same time,       

225
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,996
   the tinted adhesive flows    
   into a pan in the machine.   

226
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,333
 a roller soaks up the adhesive 
 and applies it to the plastic. 

227
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,337
     the coated film travels    
     over a narrow cylinder     

228
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,405
        with fine grooves       
         etched into it,        

229
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,408
   and the excess formulation   
     collects in the grooves    

230
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,810
  and drips back into the tank. 

231
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:10,549
   this gets rid of the excess  
and ensures an even application.

232
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,752
       the film then moves      
      through a long dryer,     

233
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:16,922
      and the heat causes       
      the coating to cure.      

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,361
  the film exits under a glare  
       of blue u.v. light.      

235
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,364
       the light activates      
     the initiator chemicals    

236
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,234
         in the adhesive        
  to further cure the coating.  

237
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,836
         next, a second         
      plastic film unwinds      

238
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,239
          and meets up          
      with the coated one.      

239
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,176
  they travel between rollers   
  that apply heat and pressure  

240
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,645
           to laminate          
     the two films together.    

241
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,582
      a computerized system     
       checks for defects,      

242
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,850
and a worker does a double check

243
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,387
   as the film passes in front  
       of a bright light.       

244
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,790
       after a third film,      
       mounting adhesive,       

245
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,793
   and release liner have been  
     applied to the product,    

246
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,862
  a technician tests a sample.  

247
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:59,397
        she pulls it off        
        a piece of glass,       

248
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,934
and a sensor measures the amount
       of force it takes.       

249
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:07,205
  the test confirms the window  
film grips the glass adequately.

250
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,208
       the production run       
      gets the green light,     

251
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,178
  so next blades trim the sides 
      and cut it to width.      

252
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:19,718
      the width of the film     
  can be customized to the job. 

253
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,822
 at the end of the cutting line,

254
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:29,027
 a worker slides a plastic core 
        onto a cylinder.        

255
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,399
 he sticks the end of the window
      film onto that core.      

256
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,838
   he activates the cylinder,   
         and it revolves        

257
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,975
       to wind the film up      
         onto the core.         

258
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,310
         sold in rolls,         

259
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,713
   the film will later be cut   
        for an exact fit        

260
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,650
       to various windows       
        by an installer.        

261
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,455
        window film comes       
      in a range of colors      

262
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,457
         with a variety         
       of characteristics.      

263
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,261
        the choice is up        
        to the customer.        

264
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,196
       but no matter what,      

265
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,768
  window film is sure to change 
      one's view of things.     

266
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,152
   narrator: motorcycle racers  

267
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,155
 typically replace their bike's 
     standard exhaust system    

268
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,222
  with a high-performance one,  

269
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,491
           which emits          
      exhaust gases faster,     

270
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,027
        clearing the way        
      for new fuel and air      

271
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,696
      to enter the engine's     
       combustion chamber,      

272
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,499
      generating more power     
      and better traction,      

273
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,369
  which produces greater speed  
        on the racetrack.       

274
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,507
     this high-performance,     
   aftermarket exhaust system   

275
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,111
   isn't any louder than your   
    standard exhaust system,    

276
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,780
         yet it delivers        
      up to 30% more power      

277
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,182
         due to its more        
        efficient design.       

278
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,518
 rather than steel construction,

279
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,920
it's made primarily of titanium,

280
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:06,391
      which is more durable     
    and weighs half as much.    

281
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,460
       the exhaust system       
   has two main components --   

282
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,730
          the muffler,          
      which dampens sound,      

283
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,264
         and the header,        

284
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,535
   which routes exhaust gases   
 from the engine to the muffler.

285
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,872
the header's tubing is made from
 a super-thin strip of titanium 

286
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,541
     that's six inches wide.    

287
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,677
  it enters a forming machine,  

288
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,147
 in which 14 stations of rollers
     apply tons of pressure     

289
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,418
 to progressively curve the edge
       of the strip upward      

290
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,687
   until they meet at the top.  

291
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:45,096
        the formed tube,        
     two inches in diameter,    

292
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,165
     then enters a chamber.     

293
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,434
 inside, a welder heats the top 

294
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:53,104
  until the edges fuse together 
       into a solid seam.       

295
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:58,643
  after the 330-yard-long tube  
   exits the welding chamber,   

296
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,979
       a powerful, carbide      
        guillotine blade        

297
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,348
      chops it into several     
         shorter tubes.         

298
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,785
       then, workers mount      
   each of those shorter tubes  

299
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,454
 onto a computer-guided machine,

300
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,123
         which bends it         
      to the shape required     

301
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,025
  for several exhaust systems.  

302
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,470
      workers then separate     
      each system's tubing      

303
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,005
      with a circular saw.      

304
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:31,276
  like the guillotine before,   
  the saw has a carbide blade.  

305
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,012
     an ordinary steel blade    
        isn't hard enough       

306
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,481
    to saw through titanium.    

307
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,084
  a welder assembles the tubes  
 to the other header components,

308
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,754
      among them the collar     
           and flange,          

309
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,890
    which connect the header    
        to the engine...        

310
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,626
         and the bulbous        
       resonance chamber,       

311
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,294
     also made of titanium.     

312
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,231
      it does a pre-muffler     
        sound dampening.        

313
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,034
    once the parts are welded   
         and inspected,         

314
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,237
     the header is finished.    

315
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,439
      they begin assembling     
           the muffler          

316
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,775
    by joining the two halves   
    of its resonance chamber.   

317
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,178
       the parts must fit       
       with a tight seal        

318
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,382
    to prevent exhaust gases    
        from leaking out.       

319
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,722
 they set the resonance chamber 
      on a welding fixture,     

320
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,792
        take a ring made        
     of perforated titanium,    

321
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,595
           and weld it          
     to the chamber opening.    

322
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:27,132
        this ring allows        
   a specific amount of gases   

323
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,601
 to enter the resonance chamber 
           at a time.           

324
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,403
         next, they weld        
     a sound-absorption tube    

325
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,206
    to the resonance chamber.   

326
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,742
            they wrap           
    the sound-absorption tube   

327
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,344
    in a fiberglass blanket.    

328
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,149
  the muffler's housing is made 
       of a titanium sheet      

329
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,618
     which a machine shapes     
        into a cannister.       

330
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,489
          at each edge,         

331
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,623
     they peel back the film    

332
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,492
     protecting the surface     
         from scratches,        

333
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:56,761
 then, with an automated welder,

334
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,330
         join the edges         
       with a strong seam.      

335
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,979
        then they remove        
  the protective film entirely  

336
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,582
     and electrically charge    
          the cannister         

337
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,651
   in a mild chemical solution  
       for about a minute.      

338
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,787
 this anodizing, as it's called,

339
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,123
        changes the color       
         of the titanium        

340
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,526
    and hardens the surface,    
    making it more durable.     

341
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,396
   after attaching an aluminum  
        mounting bracket        

342
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,663
        to the cannister,       

343
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,333
           they insert          
   the sound-absorption tube,   

344
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:39,204
    then secure the cannister   
    to the resonance chamber    

345
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,205
          with screws.          

346
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,078
           they apply           
   the manufacturer's sticker,  

347
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,648
   and the muffler portion of   
 the exhaust system is finished.

348
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,421
 to install the exhaust system, 

349
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,691
       you bolt the header      
          to the motor,         

350
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,627
    which is toward the front   
       of the motorcycle,       

351
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,630
    then mount the muffler to   
  the other end of the header.  

352
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,634
        the muffler bolts       
       to the bike chassis      

353
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,436
 via a bracket on the cannister.

354
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,041
      now the bike is ready     
      to hit the racetrack.
