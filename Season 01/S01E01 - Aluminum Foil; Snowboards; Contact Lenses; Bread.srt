narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,026
aluminum foil...

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,398
...snowboards...

6
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,170
...contact lenses...

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,876
...and bread.

8
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,989
aluminum foil
has a multitude of uses,

9
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,790
from heating something up
in the oven

10
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,461
to keeping something cold
in the fridge.

11
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:07,131
but have you ever wondered how
a huge block of solid aluminum

12
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,435
gets transformed into
a paper-thin sheet of foil?

13
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,941
the manufacture of aluminum foil

14
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,076
requires
the repeated thinning out

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,811
of a large block of aluminum.

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,948
we begin by melting ingots
of 100%-pure aluminum

17
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,816
in a natural-gas furnace.

18
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,885
these ingots, called "pigs,"

19
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,555
are essential in alloys
with zinc, titanium, and silica.

20
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,159
it takes 3 to 8 hours to melt
30 tons of aluminum

21
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,027
in this remelting furnace,

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,099
which operates
at 1,380 degrees fahrenheit.

23
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,368
the fusion temperature
of aluminum

24
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,505
is 1,220 degrees fahrenheit.

25
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,240
a portion of aluminum
is poured into this small mold

26
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,175
to make a sample.

27
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:53,043
solidifying in just seconds,

28
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,780
the sample allows for testing
to verify the contents

29
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,049
of the prepared alloy.

30
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,985
molten aluminum
runs in a movable trough

31
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:04,722
located above the tapping well.

32
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,924
at this stage,
impurities are filtered out

33
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,160
in special receptacles.

34
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,731
the molds are cooled with water

35
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,801
to accelerate the solidification
of the molten aluminum.

36
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:21,005
ingots are unmolded
and are ready for milling.

37
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,274
each ingot is massive,
measuring 14 feet in length,

38
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:28,345
5 feet in width,
and 18 inches thick.

39
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,815
it weighs a whopping 8 tons,

40
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,217
so it has to be handled
by overhead cranes

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,087
and placed on special plates.

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,489
this crust-removing machine

43
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,226
removes 1/10 of an inch
of the ingot's thickness.

44
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,895
impurities are eliminated

45
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:46,297
to achieve a perfectly
smooth finish.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,500
all traces of the liquid used
to cool the decrusting knives

47
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,769
have to be eliminated.

48
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,571
the many steps in the thinning
of the ingot begin.

49
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,974
first,
the aluminum block is crushed

50
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,843
by the hot mill rollers.

51
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,715
temperatures in the rollers

52
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:08,419
are between 850
and 1,000 degrees fahrenheit.

53
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,055
pressure on the ingot
is continually verified

54
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,556
by a technician.

55
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,194
if the pressure is too great,
the technician will lower it.

56
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,861
the heat is so high

57
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,931
that the ingot risks sticking
to the mill's roller.

58
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,601
to prevent this, everything
is cooled with a liquid

59
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,004
that's 95% water and 5% oil.

60
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,747
starting from a thickness
of 18 inches,

61
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,083
the ingot becomes increasingly
thinner with each pass-through.

62
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,752
depending on requirements,

63
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:46,290
the ingot will go through the
machine between 12 and 16 times.

64
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,459
the ingot now measures
about 3 inches in thickness.

65
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,231
it has to get down
to just 2/10 of an inch.

66
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,172
at this stage, the ingot
is about 2 inches thick

67
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,907
and measures
almost 30 feet in length.

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,379
this conveyor transports the
plate during its milling stages.

69
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,257
the ingot has become a sheet
2/10 of an inch thick.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,127
it is sufficiently thin
to proceed to spooling,

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,795
where it spools onto itself

72
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,197
before being sent
to the cold rolling mill.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,334
there, its thickness will be
reduced still further.

74
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,874
the aluminum sheet
has become very thin now

75
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,409
and risks being broken

76
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,745
by the tension needed
for cold rolling.

77
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,748
so the sheet is doubled
to avoid this breakage.

78
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,717
one final reduction in the mill,

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,685
and the sheet
will have the thickness

80
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,287
required by the customer.

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,556
a liquid coolant is used
to prevent the foil

82
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,226
from sticking to the rollers.

83
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,762
since the edges
of the foil sheet

84
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,364
are lightly damaged
and crinkled,

85
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,201
a knife removes a strip
4/10 of an inch wide.

86
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,908
finally, the roll
is cut to the desired width,

87
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,379
and one huge ingot has produced
nearly 8 miles of foil.

88
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,593
narrator: if you've ever
tried snowboarding,

89
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:32,462
you've probably discovered
that those cool moves

90
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,667
aren't quite as easy
as the pros make it look.

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,204
learning to maneuver a snowboard
is a long and involved process,

92
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,938
and it's much the same

93
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,676
when it comes to manufacturing
these surfboards for snow.

94
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,019
the snowboard is the delight
of winter-sports enthusiasts.

95
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,755
its core is made
of a thin sheet of wood.

96
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,556
various kinds of woods are used,

97
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,193
depending on the type
of board being made.

98
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,966
bindings have to be firmly
attached to the board.

99
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,701
holes are drilled for inserts,

100
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,770
to which bindings
will be secured.

101
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,575
a template allows the holes
to be precisely drilled.

102
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,378
planing reduces the board
to the required thickness.

103
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,949
a thick board is obviously
more rigid than a thin one.

104
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,325
a shaping procedure
refines the board's contours.

105
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,861
at this point, the board
is still perfectly flat

106
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,030
with no curvature.

107
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,305
the boards are then stored
upright to await the next step.

108
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,281
now they must secure
the aluminum inserts,

109
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,951
which will be embedded
in the wood.

110
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,819
this thin sheet of fiberglass

111
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,489
will create better support
for the inserts.

112
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,892
therefore,
they will be more solid.

113
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,632
to make working on it easier,

114
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,102
the board is securely
held in place by clamps.

115
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,105
epoxy,
an extremely strong adhesive

116
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,508
often used
with composite materials,

117
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,444
is applied to the fiberglass
at room temperature.

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,581
it is essential
to remove any excess epoxy,

119
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,382
as well as eliminate
all air bubbles

120
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,885
so there will be
a good adherence.

121
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,925
as for the top part
of the board,

122
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:46,063
it's made of a resistant plastic
applied by silk-screening.

123
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,668
in silk-screening, ink is spread
by this little squeegee.

124
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,003
this application
is called a pass.

125
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,606
colors have to be applied
one at a time.

126
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:59,210
the inks must dry for several
hours between each coat.

127
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,281
now the board must be curved.

128
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,150
a cover is placed on the mold.

129
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,751
when the mold is closed,

130
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,154
the board is given
the desired curve.

131
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:14,458
heat trapped in the mold
makes the epoxy set and harden.

132
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,896
the board comes out of the mold,

133
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,100
and any excess epoxy and wood
are removed by a band saw.

134
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,035
to achieve a perfect cut,

135
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,838
the saw blade is changed
every 50 boards.

136
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,475
it's highly precise work
and totally manual.

137
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,859
they apply, again by
silk-screening, another coat,

138
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,461
then another color.

139
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,396
this time, red.

140
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,413
the snowboard must now
be protected.

141
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,484
a protecting varnish flows
as a thin curtain.

142
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,753
the board passes
beneath this curtain

143
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,189
and then moves into a dryer
for a six-hour stay.

144
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,232
sanding removes surplus varnish
from the edges of the board.

145
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,702
new holes are pierced
into the board

146
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,539
to locate the inserts installed
at the beginning of production.

147
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,443
this sander removes
imperfections

148
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,045
in the hardened varnish

149
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,248
and prepares the board
for its second varnish coating.

150
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,519
then the plastic base is sanded
to obtain the desired finish.

151
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,256
the board is checked to see
that it's perfectly flat.

152
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,525
a razor blade verifies
that the different coats

153
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,262
are well-adhered to one another.

154
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,665
certain boards get an engraved
aluminum insert --

155
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,201
a luxury touch.

156
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,137
the board is now ready
for action.

157
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,874
this facility turns out over
500 snowboards per day

158
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,977
in 30 different models.

159
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,887
narrator: people who have
defective vision

160
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,422
can always wear glasses,

161
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,226
but in many cases, there's
a less-noticeable alternative.

162
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,961
contact lenses
correct faulty vision

163
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,098
without anyone knowing
the wearer even has them on.

164
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,368
what goes into making
these tiny optical aids

165
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,638
is really eye-catching.

166
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:49,979
contact lenses have been
in existence for over a century.

167
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,782
at first completely rigid,

168
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:55,786
they have become gas-permeable
and as flexible as gelatin.

169
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,122
these small polyhema disks
are used

170
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,792
to make soft polymer contact
lenses in a variety of colors.

171
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,261
we see here
a patient's prescription,

172
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,064
essential to the fabrication
of lenses.

173
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,465
the process begins

174
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,534
with data processing control
of the shaping.

175
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,137
data is supplied by computer,
which controls a digital lathe.

176
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,741
they begin by shaping
the inner curvature of the lens.

177
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,478
this digital lathe, rotating
at 6,000 revolutions per minute,

178
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,014
is equipped with
an industrial diamond.

179
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,682
it shapes the inner surface --

180
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,818
the part
that touches the cornea.

181
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,888
it must be free from any
abrasions and imperfections

182
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,957
and is polished with
a super-fine abrasive paste.

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,959
polishing is a crucial step

184
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:40,631
because it assures excellent
comfort and perfect vision.

185
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,300
a technician measures
lens thickness

186
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,570
with an extremely precise gauge.

187
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,839
they now shape
the outer surface,

188
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,175
the part that touches
the eyelid.

189
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,443
the lens is glued
with a special warm wax,

190
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,045
when the lens is completed,

191
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,783
an ultrasound device
will remove the wax.

192
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:04,054
the wax takes on the desired
shape in just seconds.

193
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,401
the comfort of a lens is also
determined by its thickness.

194
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,204
it must be as thin as possible

195
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,606
while retaining
sufficient solidity.

196
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,342
they begin by shaping
the outer diameter of the lens,

197
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,011
which takes only a few seconds.

198
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,357
they now polish the outer
surface of the lens.

199
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,692
this polishing,
done at high speed,

200
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,495
calls for an abrasive paste,
some oil,

201
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:49,566
and a small polyester
cotton ball.

202
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,837
this apparatus polishes several
lenses at the same time --

203
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,573
a step that takes
only 60 seconds.

204
00:12:56,576 --> 00:13:00,410
with everything computerized,
quality is incomparable.

205
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,085
a technician then polishes
the rims of the lens.

206
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,059
the polymer is hydrated
to make it flexible.

207
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,661
lenses remain immersed

208
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,531
in a balanced ph saline solution
for 24 hours.

209
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,934
the lens becomes engorged
with liquid and expands,

210
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,504
reaching the desired
proportions.

211
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,285
this optical topographer
is used to verify,

212
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,153
through color distribution,

213
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,689
whether the spread
of optical power in the lens

214
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,860
is precise enough
to assure perfect vision.

215
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,567
and now we proceed with another
important testing procedure.

216
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,971
the soft, fragile lenses
are always handled

217
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,739
with the greatest of care.

218
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,445
this unit,
called a frontofocometer,

219
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,113
is a metering device

220
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,983
which verifies the optical
precision of the lens.

221
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,992
the lenses are now completed
and are cleaned.

222
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,596
they're stored in containers
filled with a salt solution.

223
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,802
this little vial that
we might find at optometrists'

224
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:35,906
is sealed with a silicone cap
and another of aluminum.

225
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,944
these vials are placed
in a sterilizer

226
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,413
at temperatures
of 250 degrees fahrenheit

227
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,349
for an hour and a half.

228
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,084
the contents will remain sterile

229
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,420
for up to seven years
if not opened.

230
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,690
the production of a lens
involves 14 steps.

231
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,960
if we exclude the rather lengthy
hydration process,

232
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:00,363
actual lens production
requires only 15 minutes.

233
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,167
they can produce almost
1,000 contact lenses per day --

234
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,337
all made from these tiny
colored disks.

235
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,451
narrator: it's a staple
for people all over the world.

236
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,055
smothered in butter and jelly
or dipped in gravy,

237
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,392
it's a delicious treat
that's hard to resist.

238
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,861
and we're willing to bet
you can't resist the opportunity

239
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:36,500
to find out what goes into
the making of your daily bread.

240
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,677
over 3,000 years ago,
in the time of king tut,

241
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,348
egyptians were already baking
40 varieties of leaven bread.

242
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,551
the greeks' contribution
to this history was the oven

243
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,487
and 70 varieties
of flavored breads --

244
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,358
breads so good that the romans
took the greek bakers to rome

245
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,960
and their ovens to gaul.

246
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,762
by the middle ages,

247
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,433
bread had become the primary
food of western europe.

248
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,912
multigrain bread is made
from several ingredients

249
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,316
such as flaxseed, buckwheat,
soy, and millet.

250
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,052
this protective grill
prevents foreign matter

251
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,588
from accidentally falling
into the recipe mix --

252
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:35,258
a recipe that calls
for a half a ton of flour.

253
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:38,094
the ingredients,
ground in a mill,

254
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,598
are kept in these
36 enormous containers.

255
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,538
we begin by mixing
the ingredients together.

256
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,675
these kneading troughs
are used to ferment the yeast,

257
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,077
a step which takes three hours.

258
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,647
the fermenting yeast makes
the dough rise considerably.

259
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:09,559
this huge mixer kneads the dough
for about eight minutes.

260
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,769
when thoroughly homogenous,

261
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,506
the contents are emptied
into a large tub.

262
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,542
the dough weighs
a little over a ton.

263
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,715
the dough is loaded onto a slide

264
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,184
situated
above the dough divider.

265
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,255
at the bottom of the machine,

266
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,858
a small hole
allows the dough to escape.

267
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,793
two mechanically operated arms

268
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,463
cut the dough pieces
into equal lengths.

269
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,065
it forms 192 of these a minute.

270
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,435
the dough then falls
onto a conveyor.

271
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,409
here dough pieces
are rolled into balls,

272
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,812
which can be more easily worked.

273
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,617
the doughballs are floured

274
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,220
to prevent them from sticking
during their transport

275
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,022
and when they're molded.

276
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,491
here the balls of dough
leave the divider

277
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,959
and go to the molder.

278
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,228
during transport,
the dough can rest,

279
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,996
allowing the yeast to act.

280
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,503
the dough is then folded
and rolled.

281
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,639
the machine can handle
three per second

282
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,243
for a total of 11,500 an hour.

283
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,379
the dough is rolled out
to the exact size

284
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,515
and falls into baking molds.

285
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,854
here we see the making
of hot dog rolls.

286
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,790
these little doughballs
have to be shaped lengthwise

287
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,060
and fermented before molding.

288
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,613
here the hog dog rolls
are being machine-molded.

289
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,016
dough pieces
must not touch one another,

290
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,419
so they're spaced apart
by a small mechanical arm.

291
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:20,090
now we go back
to multigrain bread production.

292
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,296
squatted down at the bottom
of the molds,

293
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,164
the dough pieces
go into the proofer,

294
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,501
where they rise for an hour
at 110 degrees fahrenheit

295
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,770
and at 70% humidity.

296
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:38,575
then they bake for 20 minutes
at 490 degrees.

297
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:43,146
when finally baked, the loaves
end up with a nice golden color.

298
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:51,588
a vacuum system draws
the loaves from their molds.

299
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,758
they're then placed
on a conveyor to cool.

300
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,671
a guidance system takes care
of carrying the breads

301
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,407
to various sections
of the bakery.

302
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,878
when well-cooled,
breads go to the slicer,

303
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,213
which cuts 65 loaves a minute.

304
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,749
they are sliced by 7-foot-wide

305
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,152
and 16-inch-long
steel saw blades.

306
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,622
these blades are changed
every two weeks.

307
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:34,364
sliced loaves are automatically
packed at 65 per minute.

308
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,166
they're now ready for shipping.

309
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,302
some 5 1/2 hours have passed

310
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,504
between preparation
of the dry flour

311
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,641
and packaging
of the baked bread.

312
