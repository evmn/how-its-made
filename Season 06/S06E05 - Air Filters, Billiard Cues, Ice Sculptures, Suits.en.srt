00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,825
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,560
air filters...         

3
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,033
...billiard cues...      

4
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,972
...ice sculptures...      

5
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,511
...and suits.         

6
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,386
pollutants in the air     

7
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,055
can make it tough for you to breathe and function.    

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,925
but pollutants can also affect your car's performance.    

9
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,661
it's the reason an air filter is standard equipment     

10
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,729
on internal combustion engines.

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,266
the filter keeps dirt and particles out of the engine

12
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,636
so it runs smoothly and gives good mileage.    

13
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,810
trapping dust and grime is a dirty job,        

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,212
and it takes its toll.     

15
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:23,749
air filters get clogged and have to be replaced regularly. 

16
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,617
so we need a steady supply.  

17
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,152
to make an air filter,     

18
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,154
an automated spool unwinds thick paper      

19
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,758
and feeds it between two rollers.      

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,960
bumps on the rollers press indentations into the paper.  

21
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,097
the short, vertical ones are spacers          

22
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,432
to help air flow through the filter.      

23
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,303
the long, horizontal lines are the pre-fold creases.    

24
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,308
the rollers fold the paper along those lines       

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,111
as they push it out the other side.        

26
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,047
an automated counter keeps track of the folds,   

27
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,119
because each filter needs   
to have approximately 75 pleats.

28
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,655
now a conveyor belt moves the paper to a circular blade. 

29
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,124
a steel bar holds the paper pack down   

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,794
while the blade slides on a motorized rail,      

31
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,930
slicing the paper at the correct number of folds.

32
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,799
the paper pack rolls down the conveyor belt, 

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,802
heading to the next station.  

34
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,271
in the meantime,        

35
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,608
a robotic arm sprays liquid wax
onto the aluminum molds    

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,278
that will be used to shape the 
tops and bottoms of the filters.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,149
the carousel turns, positioning
another set for spraying.   

38
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,351
the wax will ensure      
that nothing sticks to the molds

39
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,987
during the next steps.     

40
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:44,763
now chrome-plated steel screens
fall into a positioning tray. 

41
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,832
a robot picks them up with magnets two at a time.  

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,570
it places them on the bottom mold for the filter.

43
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,506
a platen, or plate, bearing two top molds     

44
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,042
flips forward on the carousel. 

45
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,779
the carousel turns, and remember the paper packs? 

46
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,349
a worker places one in each of those two top molds.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,788
now a robot dispenses a liquid polyurethane mixture 

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,191
around the screen in the bottom mold.      

49
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,930
then the automated platen flips back           

50
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:22,000
so that the top molds with the paper packs face down.

51
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,403
an air cylinder pushes a platen
holding the bottom molds up  

52
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,872
to meet the top ones,     

53
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,142
and heat triggers this chemical reaction.    

54
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,810
the polyurethane swells    

55
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,479
and covers the screen and the paper pack,      

56
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,349
forming a solid, flexible plastic layer.    

57
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,753
a robot with grippers peels the
new air filter out of the mold 

58
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,022
and sets it on a cooling rack. 

59
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,358
because of the wax sprayed onto the molds,    

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
the robots don't have to work hard    

61
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,962
to pull the air filters out.  

62
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,630
like well-greased cookie sheets,

63
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,332
nothing gets stuck to the bottom.         

64
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,169
after they're cool, the rack tips up,       

65
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,638
and the air filters tumble down a slide      

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,840
to a worker who collects each one.     

67
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,976
with a band saw, she trims the excess polyurethane,    

68
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,712
or flash, from the rim.    

69
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,583
now all that's left is the packaging.       

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,654
on another assembly line,   

71
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:19,190
a robot prepares to make a radial seal type of filter. 

72
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,393
it sprays the no-stick wax   

73
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,929
onto the brims of molds that look like inverted top hats.  

74
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,532
a small wheel turns      

75
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,602
and delivers the molds to a larger assembly wheel.  

76
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,606
another robot picks up plastic caps     

77
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,808
and places them inside the molds.       

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,747
then a pneumatic pusher raises the caps,        

79
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,950
and nozzles dispense a hot glue bead onto their edges.

80
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,153
another pneumatic pusher tool 

81
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,889
forces round packs of pleated 
paper out of cylindrical holders

82
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,792
and into the molds.      

83
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,567
the big wheel keeps on turning,
positioning the molds     

84
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,971
to receive more packs, or tubes,
of filter paper.        

85
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,174
the wheel pushes the paper-filled molds     

86
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,309
onto a conveyor belt.     

87
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,846
and down the line,       
a robot pumps a polyurethane mix

88
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,449
into the bottom mold for the filter.        

89
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,190
a worker presses the paper-filled top mold onto it. 

90
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,592
heat triggers the chemical reaction     

91
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,528
that expands the polyurethane, 

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,930
encasing the bottom of the filter paper      

93
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,198
and forming a gasket      

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,667
that will fit snugly near an engine intake.     

95
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,539
the radial air filter is now completely assembled,  

96
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,941
and it's taken just 20 minutes.

97
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,943
the filters are ready to work 

98
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,213
under the hood of today's automobiles.    

99
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,158
narrator: the game of billiards
has been popular        

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
for several hundred years,   

101
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,229
dating back as early as the 15th century.      

102
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,497
then players used a mace to strike the ball.      

103
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,965
when the mace's large head   

104
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,768
made it tough to shoot along the rail,    

105
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,104
players started using its slimmer tail end.     

106
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,439
this led to the invention of the cue stick        

107
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,442
so players didn't have to worry
about switching back and forth.

108
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,582
pick a cue, but be selective, 

109
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,985
because choosing a stick that feels right for you    

110
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,321
pays off when you're behind the eight ball.        

111
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,258
to make the butt, or bottom section, of a cue,  

112
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,594
they start with a block of expensive bird's-eye maple. 

113
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,530
the wood spins on a lathe.   

114
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,599
a doughnut-shaped blade moves on rails         

115
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,400
and cuts around the circumference,       

116
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,669
turning the block into a cylinder.        

117
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,740
as it cuts, the shavings are vacuumed away.

118
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,009
now a square-tipped steel cutter

119
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,344
carves into one end of the wood.

120
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,280
it makes a groove that will be used       

121
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,216
to attach the butt's forearm to its lower part.       

122
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,553
he slides a black plastic ring around the rim         

123
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,822
and glues it down.       

124
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,956
it's decorative,        

125
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,425
but it will also give the cue some stability.        

126
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,364
next, he brushes glue on top of it to attach another ring, 

127
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,133
this one made of a nickel/silver alloy.     

128
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,839
he screws the forearm into the lower part of the butt.  

129
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,109
glue oozes out of the joint as the screws tighten.     

130
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,546
the forearm is now bonded to the lower part of the cue, 

131
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:31,182
making one butt piece.     

132
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,118
then they employ a vertical cnc lathe.     

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,188
computerized cutters move up on rails,       

134
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,792
precisely tapering each butt piece to the desired diameter. 

135
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:45,463
after that, another computerized
tool called a cnc inlay cutter 

136
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,134
chisels geometric designs into the cue's forearm.    

137
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,802
the same type of cutter    

138
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,673
carves matching designs from ebony wood.        

139
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,209
a worker removes the ebony cutouts and inspects them.   

140
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,878
he handles them cautiously   

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,782
because the thin strips of wood
are fragile and break easily. 

142
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,091
with a stick, he slathers a thick epoxy mixture     

143
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,027
into the cue stick's carved-out design.       

144
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,629
the ingredients of this high-strength glue   

145
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,831
are a trade secret.      

146
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,910
next, he presses one of the ebony cutouts      

147
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,745
into the glue-filled cavity.  

148
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,218
he fits a synthetic ivory cutout
inside of the ebony one,    

149
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,289
pressing it down into the glue with big tweezers.       

150
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,197
he continues to build the design
with another piece of ebony.  

151
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,133
these intricate inlays give the cue some attitude.  

152
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,803
a cue stick's good looks can affect a player's mind-set 

153
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,573
and give him or her a competitive edge.      

154
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,077
this glue may look a bit messy now, but when it dries,    

155
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,413
the ample amounts will keep the inlay tight,   

156
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,851
preventing air and moisture from
getting in and doing damage.  

157
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,292
he inserts little pieces of synthetic stone       

158
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,294
as a final touch...      

159
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,164
and then presses all the pieces
down with a wood dowel.    

160
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,368
next, a computerized drill bores a hole          

161
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,970
in the exact center of the joint section.     

162
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,341
a second drilling makes a thread inside the hole.

163
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,450
he screws a steel joint pin dappled with glue       

164
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,786
into the thread created by the drill,     

165
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,456
twisting it tightly with a special tool.      

166
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,458
when the joint is fully entrenched,      

167
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,726
he unscrews the tool.     

168
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,996
and now the butt can be screwed
to the shaft for the game   

169
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,064
and then taken apart for transport.         

170
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,000
an automated paint gun     

171
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,103
sprays clear varnish onto the cue sticks.      

172
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,011
a motorized stamping machine  

173
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,680
inks the logo onto the cue's butt piece.   

174
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,019
and a worker applies glue as the cue stick turns on a lathe.

175
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,354
this is in preparation for the wrap.         

176
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,557
then the turning cue pulls linen
thread from a spool,      

177
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,161
wrapping itself with the lower section with glue on it. 

178
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:33,564
this linen wrap will make the cue easier to grip     

179
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,233
and will absorb moisture.   

180
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,569
they roll the cue stick up against           

181
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,873
a high-speed cloth buffing wheel
to give it a shine.      

182
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:49,380
now these cue sticks are ready for some serious competition  

183
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,716
in the pool hall.       

184
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,198
narrator: ice sculptures can make quite an impression  

185
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,534
at a party or social engagement.

186
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,404
before they melt, their beauty can be seen and admired.    

187
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,207
mass production of ice sculptures is now possible 

188
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,343
with new machines and tools.  

189
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,579
and the market for ice sculptures is expanding.  

190
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,352
it's a curtain of ice,     

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,022
and it's in demand for big events.        

192
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,959
they string beads of ice on plastic-coated aircraft cable. 

193
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,896
as it melts, it creates a waterfall effect. 

194
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:42,100
it's guaranteed to make an impression.     

195
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,170
but just how do they get this ice to be crystal clear? 

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,576
they start by tucking     
a plastic liner into a big tank.

197
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,245
they pipe filtered water into it.            

198
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:59,183
then a worker places a measuring bar with a dipstick

199
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,584
across the tank.        

200
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,987
the dipstick is set at 10 inches.      

201
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,990
that's how thick the block of ice needs to be. 

202
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,596
he clamps electric submersible pumps on each end of the tank  

203
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,866
and positions them underwater at a 45-degree angle.     

204
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,200
these pumps are key.      

205
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,869
they keep the water moving,  

206
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,338
forcing bubbles and impurities to the top           

207
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,207
while clear water below freezes.

208
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,477
he shuts the lid to allow the water to freeze. 

209
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,881
24 hours into it, he'll remove one of the pumps. 

210
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,215
three days later,       

211
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:35,286
he probes the ice under the watery surface with a pick.

212
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,821
it needs to be level,     

213
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,525
so he checks the entire ice surface with a measuring bar. 

214
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,765
next, he siphons off the excess water with a wet vacuum.

215
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,169
he'll take off a couple of buckets full.   

216
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,778
then he attaches a lifting bar 

217
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,981
to brackets on each end of the tank    

218
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,850
and lifts the 300-pound ice block with a chain hoist. 

219
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:17,195
now he peels away the plastic liner and inspects.

220
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,997
the ice has to be absolutely perfect --     

221
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,934
no clouds, cracks, or impurities.         

222
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,803
because water expands when it freezes,        

223
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,805
the block is a bit too thick, 

224
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,208
so they slice off the excess ice
with an electric band saw,   

225
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,146
trimming it back to the desired 10-inch mark.  

226
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,216
the steel blade cuts cleanly and evenly.    

227
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:46,557
he slides the extra pieces of ice into a heated pit,    

228
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,295
where they'll melt and be recycled back into the system. 

229
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:53,831
before the ice is carved, they put the design on paper. 

230
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,434
the artist is sketching a liquor luge -- 

231
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,238
two vodka bottles made of ice, through which drinks will flow.

232
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,976
now its time to cut the ice.  

233
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,578
the block turns on a special lathe.      

234
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,513
then they propel an electric router       

235
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,449
across the spinning block.   

236
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,252
the sharp edges of the router cut into the ice.       

237
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,920
a guide wheel above the router 

238
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,122
follows a plastic outline of a bottle          

239
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,859
so it cuts precisely to the design.         

240
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,729
all this is done in the freezer.

241
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,732
the temperature in here is   
just over 17 degrees fahrenheit.

242
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,736
now the vodka bottle is starting to take shape.   

243
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,340
it takes about four minutes for this machine to carve it. 

244
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,278
this task couldn't be performed 
as quickly or precisely by hand.

245
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,851
after the carving, the worker brushes off the ice shavings. 

246
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,956
then its time for the blowtorch.

247
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,826
it melts the frost so the ice looks like glass,  

248
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,229
through which you can clearly 
see the label and plastic tubing

249
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,766
that have been frozen inside. 

250
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,302
now we have the finished vodka luge,    

251
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,405
which will be used to serve drinks at parties.  

252
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,877
the barman pours the drinks through a funnel at the top,  

253
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,546
and the drink chills all the way
down to the martini glass.   

254
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,588
if a fish fountain is more your style,      

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,725
this is how it's done, the old-fashioned way.     

256
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,660
the sculptor, armed with a chainsaw,     

257
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,031
shapes the ice following a cardboard template.

258
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,133
she smoothes the ice      

259
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,870
with an electrically powered disk grinder,         

260
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,672
then cuts in detail      

261
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,274
by using a die grinder with a triangular bit.     

262
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,412
she dusts off the snow...   

263
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:51,182
and then polishes the ice   
with a blast from the blowtorch.

264
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,554
now, that's a work of art.   

265
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,969
narrator: in today's world, suits are common,       

266
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,105
allowing both men and women to dress the part       

267
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,506
for any situation --      

268
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,109
everyday work or a special occasion.     

269
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,844
while men and women may wear different parts of a suit,   

270
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,915
the basics of the suit have been
unaltered for over a century -- 

271
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,650
a jacket and trousers or skirt.

272
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,920
it's a look that's never out of style.   

273
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,195
every suit begins with a design on paper.    

274
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,597
the style is precisely sketched.

275
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,133
it's a creative process but also highly technical.   

276
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:47,137
he plans the entire outfit, right down to the last stitch. 

277
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,707
no detail is left to chance here.    

278
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,544
they feed the design data   

279
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,947
to this computerized cutting machine.        

280
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,750
the blade slices through fabric
placed under paper.      

281
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,553
and because it's computerized, it's very precise,       

282
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,891
producing pieces that will fit together like a puzzle.  

283
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,827
this is how they used to cut the fabric -- by hand. 

284
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,428
it was more time-consuming,  

285
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,898
and the margin for error was much greater.       

286
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,370
now it's time to reinforce the fabric.    

287
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,641
she places fusing tape made of fabric onto a sleeve piece   

288
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,577
and then sends it to a heat chamber with rollers 

289
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,848
that will bond the tape to the material, giving it strength.  

290
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,185
next, it's over to the sewing machine.     

291
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,254
a worker lines up two sleeve layers,       

292
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,257
and it's hands-free from here. 

293
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,859
a rail powered by compressed air
descends            

294
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,462
and guides the fabric under the needle.       

295
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:48,132
a computer controls the sewing.

296
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,601
this frees up the operator   

297
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,871
to continuously feed the machine.          

298
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:57,742
this is an automatic pocket welt machine. 

299
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,812
she places the front of a jacket
under a clamp         

300
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,014
and puts the welt fabric in the clamp          

301
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,217
and a pocket flap at the side. 

302
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,553
the clamp automatically slides the fabrics to needles 

303
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,290
that sew the welt and flap onto the jacket.        

304
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:16,294
then two tiny knives emerge and cut the pocket open.    

305
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:21,365
the result -- a precisely made 
pocket completely by automation.

306
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,168
the only human involvement is to feed the machine     

307
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,370
and then collect the finished product.     

308
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,975
now over at another station,  

309
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:35,179
an operator irons fusible tape onto the open seams.      

310
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:39,183
this stabilizes them and gives them a crisp finish. 

311
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,586
a worker places the front of the jacket    

312
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,854
on a headless mannequin called a buck.         

313
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,589
a hot metal press moves in,  

314
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,059
and the pressing reshapes the jacket      

315
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,861
to the contours of the buck.  

316
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,998
now she puts a sleeveless jacket
on another buck        

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,401
and tucks a shoulder pad underneath.          

318
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,603
she presses a pedal to activate the machine,    

319
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,938
and the hot presses lower,   

320
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,407
melting the glue on the shoulder pad,      

321
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,276
which fuses it to the jacket. 

322
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,947
now to steam the fabric.    

323
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,416
another jacket is on another mannequin.    

324
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,818
and a worker clamps down the sleeves.    

325
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,822
a big steam bag made of porous vinyl swings in,

326
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,892
wafting steam onto the front of the jacket. 

327
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,094
at the same time,       

328
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,098
hoses pipe steam into the porous mannequin cavity,  

329
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,302
so this jacket gets a steam press from both sides. 

330
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,438
this machine is a collar master.

331
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,707
she folds the collar into the correct position   

332
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,977
and lowers a big fabric-covered
metal press onto the collar  

333
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,113
to iron down the fold.     

334
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,049
it's time for the auto-jig machine.   

335
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,118
it's making an extension piece to the second button      

336
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,654
for a pant waistband.     

337
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,589
this is the piece       
that goes over the second button

338
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,924
on the waistband of dress pants.

339
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,061
it sews and cuts two layers  
of fabric that are held in a jig

340
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:02,333
and then feeds the excess fabric
to a vacuum tube for disposal. 

341
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,137
now it's time to define a crease
in a pair of trousers.     

342
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,473
an operator slides a pair of pants, inside out,  

343
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,942
onto a double rail.      

344
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,679
then using a device similar to a caulking gun,   

345
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,015
she pipes a silicone-based liquid along the crease line. 

346
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,618
the liquid is a perma-crease mixture,   

347
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,487
which will give the crease some staying power.      

348
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,156
there's also a nib on the end of this gun     

349
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,025
which sharpens the crease.   

350
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
all that stitching and steaming

351
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,903
seems to have gone without a hitch.        

352
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,839
but the designer still needs to inspect the work

353
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,575
to see if it measures up to his original concept.    

354
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,778
if adjustments have to be made,

355
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,314
he marks the spots.      

356
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,919
that's because how it fits   

357
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,656
can be just as important as how it looks.
