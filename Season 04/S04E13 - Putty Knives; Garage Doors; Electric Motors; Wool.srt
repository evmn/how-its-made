00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,124
            narrator:           
  today, on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,761
       ...putty knives...       

3
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,666
       ...garage doors...       

4
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,173
      ...electric motors...     

5
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,078
          ...and wool.          

6
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,921
         rummage through        
  a do-it-yourselfer's toolbox, 

7
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,792
  and chances are, you'll come  
  across a putty knife or two.  

8
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,659
  they come in several widths.  

9
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,129
        so whether you're       
       scraping off paint,      

10
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,465
         old wallpaper,         
     or installing drywall,     

11
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,866
      there's a putty knife     

12
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,602
 that's the right size and shape
          for the job.          

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,543
    these putty-knife blades    
        are made of steel       

14
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,677
  that's flexible and durable,  

15
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,681
           due in part          
   to its high carbon content.  

16
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,351
 production begins with workers 
      feeding steel sheets      

17
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,420
    into a press one by one.    

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,223
     the press's cutting guy    
       punches out a blade      

19
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,560
   for the type of putty knife  
       they're producing.       

20
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,762
         the next press         
    punches three rivet holes   

21
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,298
      in the handle portion     
          of the blade.         

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,534
     these are for attaching    
     a hard plastic handle.     

23
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,235
           for models           
      that'll have a handle     

24
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,505
        made of a softer,       
       rubberlike plastic,      

25
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,041
they fishbone the handle portion
          of the blade,         

26
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,111
 so that it'll grip the plastic.

27
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,849
  steel has to be heat-treated  

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,686
  to gain its full flexibility  
          and strength.         

29
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,525
 first, they submerge the blades
    in a bath of molten salt.   

30
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,595
     the heat is intense --     
    1,400 degrees fahrenheit.   

31
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,597
         the blades soak        
      for about a minute --     

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,800
        the time it takes       
    for the metal temperature   

33
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,801
  to rise to that of the tank.  

34
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,070
           as it does,          

35
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:21,139
 the steel's molecular structure
        begins to change.       

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,341
           from here,           
    they transfer the blades    

37
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,077
   to two successively cooler   
           salt baths.          

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,414
 that quenching, as it's called,
   further hardens the steel.   

39
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,018
  the blades are then tempered  
   in an oven for eight hours   

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,686
   at 400 degrees fahrenheit.   

41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,555
  this gives the steel memory,  

42
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,692
  meaning the blade will revert 
to its original shape when bent.

43
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,562
      after heat treatment,     
       lukewarm water jets      

44
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,363
   rinse off the salt residue   

45
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,100
       and cool the metal       
      to room temperature.      

46
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,301
       now that the metal       
  has the required properties,  

47
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,970
           the blades           
     need the right profile.    

48
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:56,174
a worker lays them on a magnetic
plate that angles them downward.

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,078
  the plate spins, running the  
blades against a grinding wheel.

50
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,187
    it takes about 30 seconds   
           of grinding          

51
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,058
      to profile each blade     
   and form the flex point --   

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,793
          the thinnest          
     and most flexible part     

53
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,131
       that's 1 1/2 inches      
   from the end of the blade.   

54
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,866
      blade profiles vary,      

55
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,603
because some jobs require a more
   flexible tool than others.   

56
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,139
    now they clean the blades   

57
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,809
       in a revolving drum      
   filled with absorbent sand.  

58
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,078
        this removes oil        
       and other residues       

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,215
 left by the production process,
    and it preps the surface    

60
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:40,018
    for the protective layer    
 of lacquer that's applied next.

61
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,223
    after coating the blades    
           in lacquer,          

62
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,891
    they dry them in an oven.   

63
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,195
      this seals the metal,     
        preventing rust.        

64
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,704
            assembly            
    is completely automated.    

65
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:04,276
        the first machine       
  slips on the plastic handle.  

66
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,115
 the next machine rivets it on. 

67
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,391
      the following machine     
        slaps on a label,       

68
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,996
    which identifies the size   
    and type of putty knife.    

69
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,668
      professional-quality      
          putty knives          

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,605
 have a thicker, stiffer blade. 

71
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,508
           the handle           
    is made up of two halves.   

72
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:43,348
the machine positions them onto 
the handle portion of the blade,

73
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,218
       then attaches them       
      with a hollow ribbon.     

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,755
     this enables the knife     
         to be hung up.         

75
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,770
   this factory also produces   
   retractable utility knives.  

76
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,640
    it puts the cast aluminum   
    handles through a machine   

77
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,044
   that uses polishing stones   
 to remove any shards of metal. 

78
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:17,449
        workers assemble        
  the utility knives manually,  

79
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:21,119
first installing the push button
that moves the blade in and out.

80
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,722
 after putting in a spare blade,

81
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,791
    they close up the handle    
         with one screw.        

82
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,660
      this factory produces     

83
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,797
          150 different         
     paint-preparation tools    

84
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:36,001
    for a wide range of uses,   
    from scraping to filling    

85
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,537
      to smoothing out tape     
         on wall joints.        

86
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:52,617
            narrator:           
    garage doors come in many   
 styles, colors, and materials. 

87
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:56,621
   they can be made of steel,   
   aluminum, wood, or vinyl.    

88
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,291
   whether you choose a style   
 that's plain, paneled, smooth, 

89
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,695
      or textured, quality      
  garage doors are lightweight, 

90
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,164
  well-insulated, and airtight. 

91
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,709
 the typical residential garage 
 door is made up of four panels.

92
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,513
   each one begins as a sheet   
 of either aluminum or steel -- 

93
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,983
  two metals that can tolerate  
         harsh climates.        

94
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,651
     the side that will show    

95
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,921
       has a baked-on coat      
       of polyester paint.      

96
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,525
     depending on the model,    
the sheet passes through rollers

97
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:37,028
     that imprint a texture,    
 such as a simulated wood grain.

98
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,533
  then it goes through a press  
     that imprints a design.    

99
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,470
           this model           
  will have raised rectangles.  

100
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:49,274
 others have horizontal stripes 
      or no design at all.      

101
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,878
   after an automated machine   

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,882
    cuts the continuous sheet   
     to garage-door widths,     

103
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:00,618
         another machine        
      folds over the edges.     

104
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,490
  this creates half-inch joints 
    for attaching the panels.   

105
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,692
 the polyester paint is elastic,

106
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,695
     so it simply stretches     
        with the bending.       

107
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,832
      now on the back side      
         of the sheets,         

108
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,767
   they hot-glue metal plates   

109
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,836
          to reinforce          
     the various components     

110
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,105
       they'll later screw      
      into the garage door,     

111
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,374
 parts such as the lift handles,
           the hinge,           

112
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,110
       and the bracket for      
 the electric opener mechanism. 

113
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,712
     they also drill a hole     

114
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,848
          through which         
they'll later inject insulation.

115
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,853
    now they slide two sheets   
    together to form a panel.   

116
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,190
     they close off the ends    
      with blocks of pine.      

117
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,726
   this will prevent cold air   
    from penetrating inside.    

118
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,461
   they apply various stickers  

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,265
 with installation, maintenance,
     and safety information.    

120
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,602
    orange stick-on dots mark   
the location of the metal plates

121
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,471
    into which the installer    
      will screw the hinges     

122
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,173
        and lift handles.       

123
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:02,013
   they attach an aluminum bar  
 to the long ends of each panel.

124
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,950
   this holds the panel steady  
  during the injection process. 

125
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,087
        after injection,        
       the bars come off.       

126
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,958
    they load the panels onto   
a carousel and begin the process

127
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,761
      of filling the hollow     
interior cavity with insulation.

128
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,230
        through the hole        
      they drilled earlier,     

129
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,100
 they inject polyurethane foam, 

130
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,636
          an expanding,         
   plastic insulation material  

131
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:29,240
  that's specially designed to  
penetrate hard-to-access spaces.

132
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,509
as we see in this demonstration,

133
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,779
    the polyurethane expands    
       and becomes rigid.       

134
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,016
    this creates a solid core   
     inside the garage door.    

135
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,858
   polyurethane is one of the   
  lightest types of insulation, 

136
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,829
       so it doesn't make       
     the garage door heavy.     

137
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,208
     here's what the inside     
     of a panel looks like      

138
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,510
     once the foam hardens.     

139
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,349
       now workers install      
       various components,      

140
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,886
 such as the rubber weather seal
      on the bottom panel.      

141
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,422
   this seal prevents cold air  
            and water           

142
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,025
    from entering the garage    
         under the door.        

143
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,234
     some garage-door models    
          have windows          

144
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,569
   to allow in natural light.   

145
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,972
        workers first use       
       a high-speed router      

146
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:37,742
 to remove the rectangles where 
these windows will be installed.

147
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,381
     then they insert one of    
several window styles available.

148
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,984
            these are           
    double-sealed windows --    

149
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,320
     two thermal panes with     
 an aluminum spacer in between. 

150
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,657
  the framing around the glass  
   comes in different colors.   

151
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:56,995
 it's made of pvc -- a synthetic
  resin that doesn't discolor.  

152
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,597
       the frame prevents       
       water and cold air       

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,933
        from penetrating        
       through the window.      

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,070
          workers pack          
   the installation hardware.   

155
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,274
     then they weigh the box    
 to ensure no part was left out.

156
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,080
      at installation time,     

157
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,350
   they attach the door panels  
   at the joints with hinges.   

158
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,952
       a system of springs      
     ensures the garage door    

159
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,290
      is perfectly balanced     
       and moves smoothly.      

160
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,562
     if properly installed,     
       you should be able       

161
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:34,699
to lift or lower the garage door
       using two fingers.       

162
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,577
 narrator: electric motors are  
 made of two main components -- 

163
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,647
         one stationary,        
       called the stator,       

164
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,317
        the other a rotor       
  that moves inside the stator. 

165
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,120
           the stator           
    has multiple wire coils.    

166
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:56,921
running electricity through them

167
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,390
     creates a concentrated     
         magnetic field         

168
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,228
      that turns the rotor,     
   creating mechanical power.   

169
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,000
 the stator is lined with slots,

170
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,402
          each of which         
      holds a copper coil.      

171
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,271
  the more powerful the motor,  

172
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,174
      the bigger the stator     
    and the larger the slots.   

173
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,282
   the first step is to line    
   the slots with insulation.   

174
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,886
 this insulation will keep the  
 voltage confined to the coils. 

175
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,698
       the coils are made       
    from several copper wires   

176
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,501
         wound together         
    by programmable machines.   

177
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:48,172
      the bigger the motor,     
    the more wires per coil.    

178
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,174
         in this motor,         

179
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,877
       each coil consists       
  of 13 strands of copper wire. 

180
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,591
   now workers tie the coils.   

181
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,993
     this prevents the wires    
         from unraveling        

182
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,830
      while being inserted      
     into the stator slots.     

183
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:23,341
      workers cap each coil     
   with fiberglass insulation.  

184
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,679
       then they insulate       
     the portion of the coil    

185
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,482
     left outside the slots     
     with fiberglass sheets.    

186
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,687
 fiberglass wedges are inserted,

187
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,256
        locking the coils       
        inside the slots.       

188
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,562
       once all the coils       
   are inserted and insulated,  

189
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,365
     workers begin preparing    
         the connection.        

190
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,167
            they slip           
  an acrylic insulation sleeve  

191
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:55,973
 over both ends of each coil -- 
       13 coils, 26 ends.       

192
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:01,246
 then they group these insulated
 wires into large power cables. 

193
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,581
       the number of wires      
        per cable varies        

194
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,484
     according to the speed     
    and voltage of the motor.   

195
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,393
           they solder          
   the grouped wires together,  

196
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,196
    then insulate the cables.   

197
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,132
they tuck some inside the stator
   and leave others accessible  

198
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:27,338
to be attached to a power source
  when the motor is installed.  

199
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
        now, using a cord       

200
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,076
        made of heat- and       
  chemical-resistant polyester, 

201
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,945
   they bind the coils tightly  

202
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,348
    to ensure they won't move   
      when the motor spins.     

203
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,086
    this unit of bound coils    
  is known as the stator coil.  

204
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:46,090
  they now submerge the stator  
  in a polyester-based varnish  

205
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,425
  and vacuum it right through.  

206
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,894
    this thorough penetration   

207
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,430
      makes the stator coil     
       moisture-resistant.      

208
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,104
 the stator is put into an oven 
          for six hours         

209
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,841
   at 280 degrees fahrenheit.   

210
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:08,980
      the varnish hardens,      
  making the stator coil rigid. 

211
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,449
          now they have         
      to balance the rotor.     

212
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,520
       if it's off-kilter,      
     the motor will vibrate,    

213
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,322
     hampering performance.     

214
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,591
  they balance it the same way  
 a mechanic balances car tires, 

215
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:24,061
       only with 100 times      
       greater precision.       

216
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,332
 now they slowly slide the rotor
        into the stator,        

217
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,469
      careful not to damage     
        the stator coil.        

218
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,272
       the rotor will turn      
       on steel bearings.       

219
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,408
    they heat these bearings    
         to expand them,        

220
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,744
   so they'll install easily.   

221
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,481
   then they blow on cold air   
 to shrink them to a tight fit. 

222
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,684
      it's the same process     
  with the motor's back cover.  

223
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,827
    now they heat the fan and   
 install it over the back cover.

224
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,231
    the fan's job is to cool    
        the running motor       

225
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,767
   so that it doesn't overheat  
         and break down.        

226
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,438
       they cover the fan       
      with a safety guard,      

227
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,276
     then install a cover on    
 the front of the motor as well.

228
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,380
   they run the finished motor  
through various tests to assess,

229
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,652
 among other things, insulation 
    strength and performance.   

230
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:24,188
   these industrial motors are  
 designed for use in factories, 

231
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,991
     for running machinery,     
     such as conveyer belts,    

232
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,460
  pumps, fans, and compressors. 

233
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,607
     narrator: what do wool     
 and hand cream have in common? 

234
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,476
     well, a sheep's fleece     
 has an oily protective coating 

235
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,412
   which contains a substance   
       called wool grease.      

236
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,947
    when factories make yarn,   

237
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,683
    they first clean the wool   
        with detergents.        

238
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,219
     the grease is processed    
         into lanolin --        

239
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,289
       a common ingredient      
         in hand creams.        

240
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,632
       historians believe       
 that people began raising sheep

241
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,302
      for food and clothing     
     about 10,000 years ago.    

242
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,904
     and around 4,000 b.c.,     

243
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,775
 they started spinning the wool 
 into yarn for weaving fabric.  

244
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,312
       the romans brought       
   wool production to england   

245
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,113
        in about 50 a.d.        

246
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,182
   woolen fabrics would become  

247
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,519
   the country's chief export   
         for centuries.         

248
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,123
    in 1797, britain shipped    
     13 sheep to australia,     

249
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,191
   starting what would become   

250
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:38,663
    the largest wool industry   
       in the world today.      

251
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,408
     wool fabric is durable,    
         wrinkle-proof,         

252
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,076
    and holds its shape well.   

253
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,813
     it absorbs moisture and    
insulates against heat and cold.

254
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,415
    that's why wool is ideal    

255
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,118
          for clothing          
    like sweaters and coats.    

256
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,089
sheep shearers use power shears,

257
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,458
       removing the fleece      
          in one piece.         

258
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,699
    they discard any stained    
        or inferior wool        

259
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,569
and then sort the rest according
  to the quality of the fibers. 

260
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:23,775
this grading is based on length,
 color, waviness, and fineness. 

261
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,247
    the wool is cleaned with    
  detergents before processing. 

262
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,653
 the wool arrives at the factory
      in compressed bales.      

263
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,191
workers untie them and feed the 
wool into the opening equipment,

264
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:45,863
 whose metal tooth rollers comb 
  out and separate the fibers.  

265
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,732
     from there, the fibers     
   go into the blending room,   

266
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,469
       where air currents       
  mix different grades of wool  

267
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,272
   to get the desired texture.  

268
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,406
      if they'll be weaving     
          a wool blend,         

269
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,342
    they mix the wool fibers    
      with other material,      

270
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,611
    such as polyester fibers.   

271
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,282
      a thorough blending       
      takes about an hour.      

272
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,220
     an air pipe transports     
       the blended fibers       

273
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,422
      to the next station.      

274
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,691
 on the way, sprayers lubricate 
 them with a mineral-oil mixture

275
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,861
   to make processing easier.   

276
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,698
        the fibers arrive       
     at the carding machine,    

277
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,502
where they pass through a series
of rollers with thin wire teeth.

278
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,037
    this untangles the fibers   

279
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,807
   and lines them up parallel   
         to each other.         

280
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,510
    this process also removes   
      any pieces of debris      

281
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,745
      caught in the fibers.     

282
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:43,121
 the carding process produces a 
smooth, flat sheet called a web.

283
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:14,452
 the equipment divides this web 
     into thin, flat strips.    

284
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,226
          these strips          
    go through rub aprons --    

285
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,828
   two rollers that twirl them  

286
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,931
  into thinner, rounded strips, 
         called rovings.        

287
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,875
 the rovings wind onto a spool. 

288
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,646
     rovings look like yarn.    

289
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,382
    but if you pull on them,    
        they simply tear.       

290
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,651
     they haven't been spun,    
    so they have no strength.   

291
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:52,657
 each roving goes into a device 
    called a spinning frame.    

292
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,325
     it stretches the roving    
      and spins it tightly,     

293
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,495
      producing wool yarn.      

294
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,167
  the yarn winds onto a bobbin. 

295
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,139
         spinning gives         
       the yarn strength.       

296
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,610
      now they can weave it     
        into wool fabric.       

297
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,813
     a fully automated loom     
          does it all.          

298
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,819
     watch in slow motion as    
 it inserts one strand at a time

299
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,958
  crosswise through stationary  
       lengthwise strands.      

300
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,693
    it's computer-programmed    
            to thread           

301
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,829
          in a specific         
    under/over configuration,   

302
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,466
 according to the type of weave.

303
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,574
        the loom inserts        
     400 strands per minute.    

304
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,379
         after weaving,         
  they burn off vegetal matter, 

305
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,047
    such as straw fragments,    

306
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,516
          then they dye         
       and dry the fabric.      

307
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,786
        all wool fabrics        
        undergo finishing       

308
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,856
    to give them a particular   
      appearance and feel.      

309
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:03,327
      these spiked rollers      
     created a plush finish.    

310
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:08,532
   wool fabrics can also have   
   a sheered or flat finish.
