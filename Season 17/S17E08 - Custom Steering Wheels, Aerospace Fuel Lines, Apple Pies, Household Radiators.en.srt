narrator: what do you do when you're the proud owner   

4
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,124
of an ultra-luxurious vintage automobile        

5
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,992
that has an original steering wheel    

6
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:03,528
that's several miles short of being as elegant as the car?              

7
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,066
you order yourself a handsome custom-made steering wheel    

8
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:10,703
designer to match        
the vehicle's deluxe interior.  

9
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,542
from the plain, original steering wheel          

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,479
to a deluxe edition befitting a vintage automobile,           

11
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:26,419
custom-matched to its woodwork and leather interior.      

12
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,488
they start by skinning the original wheel,             

13
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,826
a steel ring covered in black plastic with some leather trim.              

14
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:37,363
after slicing and chiseling off the covering,          

15
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,897
they file the ring clean     

16
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,435
because they'll be reusing it for the new wheel.        

17
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:46,438
however, they'll encase it within two plywood rings     

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,240
to beef up the width and thickness     

19
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:52,712
and to create a substrate on  
which to glue the wood veneer.  

20
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,580
using a jigsaw and bandsaw,   

21
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,383
they cut a front ring and a back ring   

22
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,685
out of european birch plywood.  

23
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:04,122
then they mill the profile,   

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,426
including a groove inside for the metal ring.       

25
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:14,600
once the shape is finalized, they sand the surface smooth   

26
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,403
to prep it to receive the wood veneer.   

27
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,878
veneer is made from a piece of wood       

28
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,814
sliced into ultra-thin sheets called leaves.          

29
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,549
for each steering wheel,     

30
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,818
they take four consecutively cut leaves  

31
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,154
so that their wood-grain pattern is nearly identical.       

32
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,958
for each plywood ring, they take two of those leaves  

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,895
and tape them mirror-image to each other.          

34
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,698
they insert adhesive where the taped edges meet    

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,632
and let it dry overnight.    

36
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,636
then they lay the ring pattern onto the veneer,         

37
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,571
trace, and cut out the shape.  

38
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,974
next, they notch the veneer ring              

39
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:58,377
so that it can fold over the ring's edges.      

40
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,714
after coating the plywood ring with glue,            

41
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,884
they center the veneer and tape down the edges.     

42
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,862
next, they add a layer of protective plastic  

43
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,465
followed by rubber cushioning.  

44
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:23,068
these will protect the veneer  
surface in the next machine --  

45
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,138
a vacuum press.         

46
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,478
powerful suction draws the bag tightly around the materials.  

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,215
this locks the veneer onto the plywood substrate,   

48
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,350
forcing out any air in between them         

49
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,386
which would hinder full adhesion.          

50
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,824
each plywood ring is now veneered         

51
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,159
and ready to encase the metal ring          

52
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,094
of the original steering wheel.             

53
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,163
the workers apply glue      

54
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:55,935
to the underside of both rings, into the groove.         

55
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,907
then they assemble the two veneered rings      

56
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,409
over the metal one.       

57
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:14,854
they set clamps all around and leave the glue to dry overnight.           

58
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,262
the next day, they remove the clamps      

59
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,599
and put the steering wheel in an oven for about eight hours              

60
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,334
to cure the glue.        

61
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,202
once the steering wheel cools,  

62
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:34,072
they file away excess glue that seeped out the seam,    

63
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:38,077
then sand the entire surface silky smooth.          

64
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,147
they protect the delicate veneer with eight coats of resin,    

65
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,150
cured in the oven for optimal durability.     

66
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:49,622
they then polish the surface with a series of compounds    

67
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,090
to produce a glossy finish    

68
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,826
which highlights the richness of the wood grain.             

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,165
the perimeter of the steering wheel now completed,  

70
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:04,103
they cover the spokes and hub with fine leather,        

71
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:07,973
first gluing the pieces...    

72
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,577
then hand-stitching them.    

73
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,331
they put back the original steering wheel's hub,      

74
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,467
which they had removed before the makeover.       

75
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,607
then the finishing touch -- a veneered horn button.     

76
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,611
after all, when you're driving a luxury car,      

77
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,914
you might just want to toot your own horn.   

78
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,099
narrator: be they airplanes, satellites, or rockets,     

79
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,569
aerospace vehicles all have one thing in common   

80
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,704
besides their capacity to fly.  

81
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,240
their internal construction   

82
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,976
includes several assemblies of tubes and ducts        

83
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,310
through which materials     

84
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:22,848
such as fuel, air,       
oil, and hydraulic fluid move.  

85
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,186
aerospace tube-and-duct assemblies     

86
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,522
are typically made of highly durable, lightweight materials,           

87
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,192
such as aluminum and titanium.  

88
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:36,328
the choice of material depends on the application,   

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,530
for example,          
whether the finished component  

90
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:43,802
must be able to resist high heat or withstand high pressure.   

91
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,204
these aluminum tubes are on their way         

92
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:50,209
to becoming a fuel line for a boeing 737.        

93
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,079
the operator immobilizes a tube with clamps,           

94
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,615
then saws it to the length required.     

95
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:05,557
this leaves burrs -- sharp shards -- on the cut edge,              

96
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,762
so they insert the tube into a deburring machine.    

97
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:21,239
here's what the tube looks like before deburring and after.   

98
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,776
they squirt some lubricant inside,      

99
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,312
then slide the tube       

100
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:30,049
onto the mandrill of a computer-guided bender.   

101
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,653
as the machine forms the tube to the required shape,      

102
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,123
the mandrill provides counter-pressure,    

103
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,393
preventing the tube walls from collapsing inward.     

104
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,062
they'll repeat this process   

105
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,098
with all the tubes which make up the fuel-line assembly.     

106
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,605
they clamp each part into a fixture,         

107
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,875
then pass a laser-measuring device over it.         

108
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,476
with utmost precision,      

109
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,080
the laser analyses the dimensions     

110
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,681
from five different angles    

111
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,684
to ensure the part meets technical specifications.         

112
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,689
next, workers submerge the part              

113
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,293
in hot water and cleaning solution, then rinse twice.   

114
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:19,030
this washes away the lubricant and any dirt.   

115
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,633
now the high-tech precision work can begin.            

116
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,305
a robotic laser-cutting system finalizes the shape       

117
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,509
and cuts all the required holes and slots.         

118
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,894
just a bit of pressure, and   
the cut pieces easily pop out.  

119
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,736
meanwhile, a stereolithography machine makes the fixtures,   

120
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,139
which will position the various parts of the fuel line together            

121
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,207
for welding.           

122
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,742
a computer-guided laser beam   

123
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,345
repeatedly flashes the shape of the fixtures    

124
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,546
onto liquid ceramic.       

125
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,215
each flash solidifies      

126
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,152
a 250th-of-an-inch-thick layer of the liquid.          

127
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,691
thousands of hardened layers later,    

128
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,461
the weld fixtures are fully formed.        

129
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,108
welders use these ceramic fixtures      

130
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,046
to correctly assembly the connecting fuel-line components.           

131
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:45,918
once everything's precisely in position, the welding begins.             

132
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,991
for aircraft safety,       

133
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:57,129
it's critical that every fuel line be leak-free.     

134
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:01,266
to test for leaks, they fill it with nitrogen at high pressure,            

135
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:05,403
submerge it in a water tank, then watch closely for bubbles,            

136
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,874
which would indicate nitrogen escaping.        

137
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,009
they use nitrogen rather than air         

138
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,478
because its molecules are smaller,           

139
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,881
making it possible to detect smaller leaks.     

140
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,217
after this,           

141
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,286
they heat-treat the fuel line to harden the metal       

142
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,089
and apply an anti-corrosion coating.    

143
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,691
they wrap the fuel line     

144
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,961
with high-heat-resistant foam insulation         

145
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:32,564
secured with high-heat-resistant polyester tape.         

146
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,634
this insulation prevents fuel from freezing   

147
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,901
in cold temperatures.      

148
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,237
it also blocks heat       

149
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,972
coming from other components of the aircraft,         

150
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,876
keeping the fuel        
at a safe working temperature.  

151
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,180
after a final inspection,    

152
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,116
the fuel line is ready     
to be shipped to the customer.  

153
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,419
it leaves the factory      
with a few un-insulated spaces  

154
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,922
for installation clamps.     

155
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,057
these areas will get insulated  

156
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,261
after the fuel line is mounted in the aircraft.         

157
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,876
narrator: the apple pie is a mouth-watering treat.    

158
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:21,346
this pie's popularity has been centuries in the making.     

159
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,949
it dates back to the 14th century,       

160
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:27,419
when countries like england, denmark, and sweden   

161
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,488
developed slightly different versions,   

162
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,957
all leaving fans hungry for more.         

163
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,765
today, apple pie is mass-produced to meet demand.             

164
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,767
so you can throw away your rolling pin         

165
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,969
and let the folks at the factory do all the work.         

166
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:49,040
to make the filling, they empty loads of apple slices             

167
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,511
into a huge steam-heated kettle.             

168
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,646
these apples are a firm and tart type     

169
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,781
and have been organically grown.             

170
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,850
they add honey and apple juice,             

171
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,319
and the apple slices simmer in the liquids      

172
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,923
while mixing blades gently blend the ingredients.  

173
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,926
and with the slices now partially cooked,      

174
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:11,129
they spice up the mix with a generous dash of cinnamon.   

175
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,399
to thicken it to a syrupy sweetness,      

176
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,501
they add tapioca flour.     

177
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,940
the blades fold the dry ingredients into the mix               

178
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,876
as the apple slices continue to cook.        

179
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,879
the fruit softens and releases juices.       

180
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,949
the liquids thicken to a syrupy consistency.     

181
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,418
when the apple slices are lightly browned,       

182
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,820
this filling mix is done.    

183
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,889
these browned and syrupy slices             

184
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,093
are now prepared and ready for the pastry shell.             

185
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,228
the shell starts with chilled premium-grade butter.  

186
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,831
it's the creamiest.       

187
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,433
organic and 100% whole-wheat flour    

188
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,438
is the next ingredient in    
this high-fiber pastry recipe.  

189
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,909
they pour a measured amount of honey    

190
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,445
into the pastry mix to sweeten it.          

191
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,114
they add ice-cold water.     

192
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,851
it's cold to keep the butter from melting too quickly,    

193
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,254
and that means         
the crust will turn out flaky.  

194
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,989
inside the pastry mixer,     

195
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,525
a dough hook blends and kneads the ingredients         

196
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,061
until they congeal into dough.  

197
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,531
the dough is moist, but not too wet and sticky.   

198
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,267
inside an apparatus called a sheeter,        

199
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:26,204
a mechanized roller       
presses the dough into sheets.  

200
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,273
a worker drapes a sheet of dough              

201
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:31,410
over groupings of four paper pie plates,    

202
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:34,546
which then move forward on a carousel.          

203
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:38,416
meanwhile, overhead, that syrupy apple filling    

204
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,219
funnels into a device called a depositor.       

205
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:45,690
the depositor pumps the filling into the uncooked pie crusts   

206
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,894
as they circle around on the loop conveyor.      

207
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:50,362
this automated system      

208
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,865
fills every second grouping of crusts right on cue.     

209
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:57,035
now full of sweet fruit,     

210
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,904
a worker tops them with more dough,         

211
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,706
giving the pies the upper crust.             

212
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,376
like a big, revolving cookie-cutter,          

213
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,378
a rolling die punch-cuts the dough around the pie plates,             

214
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,314
separating them,         

215
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,784
trimming and crimping the edges all in one action.        

216
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,589
pedestal lifts hoist the pies,  

217
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,925
and a worker transfers them to the next conveyor.      

218
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,596
they finish one group of pies and then start another,     

219
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:28,332
for a continuous cycle of pie production.        

220
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,603
the pies now head into the baking zone.    

221
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,878
here, workers arrange the pies on baking sheets.        

222
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,547
they slice holes in the top crusts        

223
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,151
to vent steam and prevent    
fruit juices from overflowing.  

224
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,623
they stack the pie-laden baking sheets   

225
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,025
on racks in a convection oven.  

226
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,062
the racks spin for a more even baking job.   

227
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,499
they send one apple pie from each batch         

228
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,101
to the quality assurance department.           

229
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,705
here, the inspector takes in the aromas       

230
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,706
from the freshly baked pie.   

231
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,241
she examines its form      

232
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,445
and compares it to an existing perfect pie.   

233
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:17,248
slicing it confirms that the crust is flaky.     

234
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,651
but does it have that melt-in-your-mouth flavor?             

235
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,188
there's only one way to verify that.         

236
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,391
if the quality assurance people approve the pie,         

237
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,127
then the whole batch moves forward.          

238
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,598
they flash-freeze the pies, then seal them in cellophane.  

239
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,001
suctioning arms open cardboard containers,    

240
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,204
and a worker slides in the pies.              

241
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,676
rollers close the pre-glued flaps.       

242
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,615
they produce more than 2,100 apple pies    

243
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,685
every hour at this factory.   

244
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:57,889
once the job is done, there are big decisions to be made --               

245
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,024
like one scoop or two?      

246
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,227
one slice or the whole pie?   

247
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:08,366
perhaps it's best just to dig in and decide later.        

248
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,053
narrator: invented in 19th century america,     

249
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,322
the radiator brought warmth to people's lives.        

250
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,592
it made central heating possible.            

251
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:36,661
before that, several fireplaces and stoves  

252
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,463
were needed to warm a home.   

253
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,731
but with a radiator in every room,          

254
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,668
one boiler could heat an entire house.   

255
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,340
while the traditional cast-iron radiator        

256
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,741
is still a source of warmth,   

257
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,745
it now competes with modern steel versions.   

258
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:58,083
these steel radiators are lighter and heat a room faster.             

259
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,552
they also come in a range of styles       

260
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,455
and can make a colorful design statement.   

261
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:10,628
production begins with a series of powerful punch presses.    

262
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,898
they punch holes in steel plates,         

263
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,770
and they shape the parts by pressing the metal onto dies.              

264
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,641
these punched and pressed parts are called half pieces.     

265
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:26,311
they'll be used to make radiator headers,    

266
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,578
the connector part        

267
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,181
that interlinks the tubular heating elements.  

268
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:35,787
the half pieces exit the punch-press station   

269
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,890
and slide into the clutch of a robotic device.       

270
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:45,196
it brings two half pieces together in perfect alignment  

271
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,866
and delivers them to an automated welder,     

272
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,201
which joins them at the seam.  

273
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,738
the process is usually shielded by a protective cover,      

274
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,210
but it's been lifted to allow our camera to video it.               

275
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,880
next, a press pares down the bulging seam.   

276
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,750
this is called deburring.    

277
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,287
with perfect timing, a robot then moves in      

278
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,224
and transfers the assembly to a grinding station.      

279
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,296
here, it rotates between two sanding belts    

280
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,899
to smooth the seam to a flawless finish.      

281
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,570
a circular saw spins towards the part      

282
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,341
and slices it in the center to create two radiator headers.            

283
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,248
these radiator headers are now complete.        

284
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
a gripper with rounded claws   

285
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,253
transfers six steel tubes to a welder.           

286
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,525
the welder fuses the tubes to the headers,            

287
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,794
and while the welding is being done,          

288
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,531
another feeder robot ensures a steady supply of headers.   

289
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,067
there's one header for two tubes,          

290
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,802
so three radiator modules    

291
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,605
are coming together simultaneously.         

292
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,942
sharp, pinscher-like knives sheer down the protruding welds              

293
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,246
so they're flush to the rest of the parts.    

294
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,619
the welded modules then chaff against two grinding belts.   

295
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,390
the process smoothes the seams substantially.          

296
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,965
but this grinding misses the spaces between the steel tubes,             

297
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,435
so a smaller sander tucks into that location,    

298
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,171
making the weld smooth all the way around.       

299
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,310
now a test.           

300
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,180
they immerse          
a four-element module in water  

301
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,182
and pump air into it.      

302
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,519
no bubbles in the water mean no leaks, and production continues.           

303
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,056
they now build the radiator section by section.       

304
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,660
they layer the modules and weld them together at the headers.  

305
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,732
this sectional approach     

306
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,935
allows them to assemble radiators of virtually any size.              

307
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,138
each radiator is custom-ordered         

308
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,409
to fit into a specific space and to meet a specific heating need.              

309
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,078
of course, the larger the radiator,     

310
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,682
the more heat it delivers.    

311
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,985
here's an inside look at a steel radiator header.   

312
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,489
with the radiator now complete,            

313
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,226
they repeat the test done earlier           

314
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,762
and confirm that it's completely leak-proof.           

315
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:34,566
they now run an electrical charge through the radiator,   

316
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,502
as they immerse it in a primer.             

317
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,838
the charge causes the primer to cling to the metal.      

318
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,176
once baked on, it will protect it from corrosion.    

319
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:49,314
this household radiator is ready for a coat of paint.  

320
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:52,050
the customer selects the color beforehand   

321
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:56,454
to suit the home's interior   
design and his personal taste.  

322
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,256
they bake on the finish,     

323
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,792
and once it cools, they wrap up the job.      

324
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,063
these radiators are now homeward bound.     

325
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,598
fueled by a furnace,       

326
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,800
hot water will move through them in a continuous loop,      

327
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,936
and they'll exude warmth.    

328
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,605
that's why the radiator continues to be   

329
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,041
a nice thing to come home to.
