narrator: sixty years ago,   

4
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,255
surfers in california     
were looking to ride the streets

5
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,857
like they surf the waves.   

6
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,325
they came up with an idea   

7
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,195
to strap roller skate wheels on their surfboards,      

8
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,197
and the skateboard was born.  

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,134
since then, skateboarding has evolved into a sport, a passion

10
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:14,272
and a lifestyle for people all over the world. 

11
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,474
in a backyard pool, a skater  

12
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:20,712
gauges the feel and response of these recycled skateboards. 

13
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,955
recycled skateboards give new life         

14
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,691
to unrideable old boards.   

15
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,462
the boards on this rack would normally end up in a landfill. 

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,534
first, the designer heats up the old grip tape   

17
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,701
and peels it off.       

18
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,339
this reveals the board's original graphics.       

19
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,679
he grinds off the graphics, leaving bare wood.       

20
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:03,589
he applies epoxy on top of a colored veneer coating  

21
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,723
and stacks the boards     

22
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,359
on the table of a bottle jack press.    

23
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,729
he glues another board     

24
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,265
and places it on top of the first one.       

25
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:19,271
he repeats this stack process with different colored boards. 

26
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,740
the stacking continues until the designer       

27
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,409
has about 20 boards on the table.         

28
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,746
he puts the bottle jacks in place and cranks them up.  

29
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,618
each jack applies 10 tons of compression,        

30
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,688
pressing the boards together while the epoxy cures     

31
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,924
and the excess glue drips out. 

32
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:47,432
the designer makes a cross cut in the stack with a bandsaw.  

33
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:51,270
each new board he makes comes with a unique color design.  

34
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:59,311
a worker traces a cutting mark on the board          

35
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,381
and makes a rough cut along it with a jigsaw.    

36
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,452
he sands down the rough profile

37
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,522
of the board using a table-mounted belt sander.  

38
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,329
before the board goes to silk screening,    

39
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,864
he uses a custom template to drill holes         

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,667
for the assembly bolts.    

41
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,138
a designer pours water-based ink

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,610
on top of a screen printing mesh.   

43
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,078
he takes a squeegee      

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,213
and pulls the ink through the membrane      

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,483
to print the company logo onto the board.        

46
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,819
he removes the silk screening frame,   

47
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,256
and the board continues on to the epoxy phase.      

48
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:51,163
a worker pours epoxy resin on top of a fiberglass cloth. 

49
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,765
he spreads out the epoxy with a squeegee        

50
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,235
in a slow, constant motion.  

51
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,770
this keeps air bubbles, runs, or drips         

52
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,974
from ruining the finish of the board.         

53
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,309
the cloth absorbs the resin.  

54
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,182
the worker cuts off the excess cloth with a razor blade    

55
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,584
and applies a finish coat of epoxy,           

56
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,520
completing the board's covering.

57
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,988
a worker uses a router     

58
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,592
to smooth out the curve of a different board.     

59
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,732
he finishes the board profile with fine sanding paper.    

60
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,200
a worker sprinkles recycled crushed glass     

61
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,470
on the epoxy-covered board.  

62
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:35,540
this will provide grip for the board instead of grip tape.

63
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,942
before the resin hardens and cures,           

64
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,146
he presses the glass into the epoxy with a wheel.  

65
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:47,018
he sands the bottom of the board
with a sanding block.     

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,421
he goes through seven different grits of sand paper. 

67
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,823
then the board is washed    

68
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,827
and polished before starting the final assembly process.   

69
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,162
a worker assembles the wheels on a truck           

70
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,633
and bolts them on with hex nuts.

71
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,568
he tightens the wheels with a wrench         

72
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,638
until he's reached the desired torque ratio    

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,574
and gives them a test spin.  

74
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,910
he inserts bolts through the board       

75
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,646
and places a urethane riser pad
underneath the skate deck.   

76
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,949
then he starts assembling the truck.     

77
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,589
he uses a screw gun to secure the wheel trucks in place.   

78
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,864
each skateboard is equipped with polyurethane wheels    

79
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,866
mounted on metal trucks.    

80
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,536
these allow the rider to steer and control the board.

81
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,606
recycled skateboards are made form a wide variety      

82
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:45,009
of shapes, deck sizes, wheels and trucks,       

83
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,181
suiting each rider's unique tastes and performance needs. 

84
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,357
narrator: many years ago,   

85
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,759
danish bakers got creative with pastry dough.

86
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,493
they began braiding it,    

87
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,896
putting a whole new twist on deserts.          

88
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,965
braided pastry looks more elaborate      

89
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,366
than ordinary pastry.     

90
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,036
the flakiness of the dough and the scrumptious fillings  

91
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,339
make braided pastry taste as good as it looks.      

92
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,178
factory-made braided pasty   

93
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,448
can be kept frozen until you're ready to eat it. 

94
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,383
after just a few minutes in the oven,          

95
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,053
you will have a fresh-baked desert.     

96
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,523
the pastry looks as though it takes many hours to prepare,  

97
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,660
but of course, it is no trouble at all.    

98
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,328
to produce braided pastry,   

99
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,065
this factory uses a number of ingredients,        

100
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,602
including yeast...       

101
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,872
granulated sugar...      

102
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,341
pastry flour....        

103
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,478
...dried eggs and water.    

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,415
the ingredients go into a large
refrigerated mixer.      

105
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,484
the cooling keeps the yeast dormant       

106
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,187
as beaters work the ingredients
into dough.          

107
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,157
after the dough leaves the mixer,       

108
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,360
it tumbles into a hopper.   

109
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,897
a cutter wheel chops the dough into several pieces.      

110
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,566
the pieces of dough travel between conveyors       

111
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,101
that squeeze them into ribbons of dough     

112
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,171
that will be fed to an extruder.

113
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,110
the extruder shapes the elongated dough pieces   

114
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,345
into one continuous sheet.   

115
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,985
at the exit of the extruder,  

116
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,788
an employee dusts the conveyor with flour. 

117
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,991
this prevents the dough from sticking to it.      

118
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,727
a pump at the extruder exit spreads big blocks       

119
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,298
of soft butter across     
the newly formed sheet of dough.

120
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,269
down the conveyor,       

121
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,938
plow-like flaps fold the buttered dough over, 

122
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,808
creating a double layer.    

123
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,477
this folding process, called lamination,       

124
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,346
will build up multiple layers of buttered dough,       

125
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,016
resulting in a very flaky pastry.    

126
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,956
next, the dough travels into a drum      

127
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,958
with spinning rolling pins.  

128
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,962
these rolling pins flatten the folded dough significantly,

129
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,698
compressing the layers into one thin sheet.      

130
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,968
now, a conveyor takes the compressed sheet   

131
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,638
through a device that will fold the dough again.

132
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,515
next, rolling pins squeeze the stack of dough   

133
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,918
into a single piece once again.

134
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,793
revolving cutters slice the laminated dough   

135
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,195
as it moves forward.      

136
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,365
the cuts create angled strips for braiding.         

137
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,205
at the next station, a sweet cherry filling     

138
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,410
with a jam-like consistency is waiting.          

139
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,880
nozzles deposit precise amounts
of cherry filling       

140
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,949
between the angled cuts.    

141
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,685
next, workers braid the dough over the center filling,    

142
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,455
creating an attractive-looking pastry. 

143
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,892
sensors determine       

144
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,930
where the blade        
will slice the braided pastries.

145
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,769
the braided pastries are transferred        

146
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,772
to another conveyor with a scale.         

147
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,774
the scale confirms that there is

148
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,711
a sufficient amount of filling in each pastry.        

149
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,513
the braided pastries now head into a freezer    

150
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,651
set a temperature of 29 degrees below zero.   

151
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,252
inside the freezer,      

152
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,257
the pastries revolve on carousels for 45 minutes.  

153
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,094
this gradual freezing process preserves the yeast.      

154
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,598
next, the pastries wind their way         

155
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,668
toward the packaging station. 

156
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,937
here, workers place a packet of icing       

157
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,805
under each braided pastry   

158
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,542
and send them to an automated packager.   

159
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:19,084
machines wrap a plastic sleeve around the pasty.       

160
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,621
to minimize the amount     

161
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,956
of time the pastry is out of the freezer,     

162
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,158
things must move quickly.   

163
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,963
the pastries pass over a weigh station   

164
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,500
to confirm the correct amount has been packaged.       

165
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,771
when baked, the pastry rises significantly,

166
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,174
allowing the braided profile to expand.           

167
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:47,112
the layers of dough separate and become flaky.       

168
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:50,048
the cherry filling seeps into the pastry.        

169
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,585
endings don't get much sweeter than this.    

170
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,863
narrator: pass by any construction site, 

171
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,331
and you'll probably see a trailer.           

172
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,501
construction trailers provide room for an on-site office   

173
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,137
or lunch room for the construction workers. 

174
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,673
a trailer can also be used as a decontamination room    

175
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,076
for workers to remove their protective clothing   

176
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,546
and shower after handling hazardous materials.      

177
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,150
construction trailers     
are typically 10 to 13 feet wide

178
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,520
and up to 59 feet long.    

179
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,693
the inside of the trailer can be equipped        

180
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,761
for whatever function it will serve.         

181
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,237
the structure of the trailer  
is made of spruce, pine, or fir.

182
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,908
workers start with an underfloor
made of wood particle board.  

183
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,311
then they nail floor joists to the boar and frame them.  

184
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,314
the insulate the floor with fiberglass wool      

185
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,384
and nail a plywood subfloor on top.            

186
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,587
then they spread tile glue over the subfloor.       

187
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,324
the glue is freeze-proof and mold resistant.      

188
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,460
they complete the floor by laying down         

189
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,329
commercial-grade vinyl tile or linoleum.          

190
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,267
to build the walls of the trailer.        

191
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,402
they nail pieces of woods called studs          

192
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,672
every 15 inches along the sole plate.     

193
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,743
the sole plate is the bottom section of the trailer's wall. 

194
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,280
then they build rough openings for the windows and doors.   

195
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,016
finally, they nail another horizontal piece    

196
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,885
along the top of the studs.  

197
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,621
this is called the double top plate.     

198
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,423
the structure of the wall is complete.    

199
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,227
now, they apply glue to the studs and nail     

200
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,295
on a sheet of plywood to the lower part       

201
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,097
of the wall structure.     

202
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,765
they repeat this process    

203
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,502
with the three other walls of the trailer.        

204
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,371
then they raise each wall   

205
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,709
and nail a sole plate to the floor.         

206
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:01,779
the plywood exterior wall extends below the sole plate, 

207
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,516
covering the side of the floor frame.      

208
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,851
they glue the plywood to the floor frame       

209
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,087
and reinforce it with nails.  

210
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,859
next, the roof of the trailer --

211
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,195
it is constructed in layers.  

212
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,398
first, they lay down the fiber board ceiling, 

213
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,003
then install a plastic vapor barrier.    

214
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,339
next, the roof joists --    

215
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:32,076
the joists have sloped edges to drain water off the roof   

216
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,213
and holes for electric cables.      

217
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,215
once the joists are installed, 

218
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:42,353
workers frame the roof structure
with end plates.        

219
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,555
then they thread in electric cables        

220
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,224
for the lights, outlets, baseboard heaters,       

221
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,160
and other electrical components.

222
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,766
now, they begin their work inside the trailer.      

223
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,234
first, fiberglass wool insulation   

224
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,537
is installed between the studs.

225
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,242
a plastic vapor barrier is added.           

226
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,046
then they install smooth wood panels.      

227
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:12,250
the wood panels are laminated with vinyl for a clean finish. 

228
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,718
at the same time,       

229
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,388
work continues on the outside of the construction trailer.  

230
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,925
under the floor, workers install one to three axles.  

231
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,128
the amount depends on the trailer's length.    

232
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,532
each axle can support around two and a half tons.  

233
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,405
after workers install all of the exterior plywood,  

234
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,475
workers begin the finishing process.     

235
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,677
at the top and bottom of the trailer,        

236
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,348
they install starter moldings made of painted sheet steel.  

237
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,719
then they begin installing panels of painted steel.    

238
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,560
windows and doors are installed

239
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,297
before adding the painted steel siding.   

240
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,365
this is so the ends of the steel siding      

241
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,701
will beneath the door or window moldings,      

242
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,803
producing a neater finish.   

243
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,382
trailers longer than 32 feet  

244
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,384
have both heating and air conditioning      

245
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,588
via a duct system.       

246
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,191
workers mount the air ducts to the ceiling with brackets. 

247
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,593
they also install electrical outlets,      

248
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,529
light fixtures, interior trims,

249
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,532
and electric baseboards for additional heating.    

250
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,734
trailers shorter than 32 feet 

251
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,736
only have electric baseboard heaters   

252
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,738
and a window-mounted air conditioner.        

253
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,274
however, there is the option to upgrade 

254
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,276
to the full duct system.    

255
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,477
to finish the roof,      

256
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:51,416
they staple white fiberboard to the roof joists.      

257
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,951
then a hitch system is installed.         

258
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,120
this enables a truck to haul the trailer       

259
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,090
to and from the construction site.     

260
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,301
narrator: a metalworking vise      

261
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,503
holds a piece of metal in place

262
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,940
so that a computerized cutter can shape it into a part.   

263
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,512
you often see vises on "how it's made."      

264
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,615
now it's time to find out how they are made.       

265
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,655
metalworking vises have parallel jaws       

266
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,292
that close tightly around a piece of metal.    

267
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,064
their firm grip allows a part 

268
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,600
to be machined with pinpoint accuracy.    

269
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,275
to make a metalworking vise, they start with a steel rod.  

270
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:55,213
it spins in a lathe as tools carve threads into it.

271
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,815
the result is a lead screw   

272
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,719
that will be used to open and close the jaws of the vise.

273
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,559
next, cutters transform a piece
of aluminum into a thumb screw.

274
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,562
the thumb screw is used for turning the lead screw.  

275
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,830
the outside of the screw    

276
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,633
is given a neural texture for better gripping.      

277
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,236
the final tool shaves the roughed-edge rim  

278
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,305
of the screw to make it smoother to the touch.   

279
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,642
this completes the thumb screw.

280
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,445
now, an automated saw cuts the steel bar       

281
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,380
into smaller pieces.      

282
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,984
each piece will be used to make the base of a vise.  

283
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,454
next, a cutter sculpts the outside of a base piece  

284
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,557
to the desired profile.    

285
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:46,130
another tool carves a channel 
in the center of the base piece.

286
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,274
the cutting machine also creates components    

287
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,376
for the vise's shuttle system. 

288
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,482
then a machine cuts the reverse side        

289
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,984
of the vise base flat and smooth.        

290
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,823
it also drills holes      

291
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,026
for mounting the vise to milling equipment.     

292
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,631
a constant flow of coolant is applied     

293
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,968
to protect the tool from wear. 

294
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,304
next, a steel block is locked in a vise.      

295
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,708
yes, they used vises to make new vises.       

296
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,648
the vise holds the piece of steel firmly in place    

297
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,352
as tools shape it       
into one of the new vise's jaws.

298
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,924
after a heat treatment,    

299
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,926
they spray small particles of sand    

300
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,996
onto the newly formed jaw.   

301
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,699
the sand blasting removes blemishes.       

302
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,938
a worker now submerges all parts of the vise      

303
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,607
in a hot chemical solution,  

304
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,210
leaving them there for eight hours.        

305
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:10,147
this chemical solution gives the parts a black oxide finish 

306
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,450
and protects them from rust.  

307
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:20,157
here is the vise before and after the oxide treatment. 

308
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,692
next,             

309
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,694
a laser etches the brand name, 

310
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,563
part number, and basic dimensions      

311
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,565
onto the base of the vise.   

312
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,040
then a probe gauges the size of the mounting hole.     

313
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,242
it also determines       

314
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:42,179
if they've been drilled in the correct location.    

315
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,448
now, it's time to assemble all the parts   

316
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,518
of the metalworking vise.   

317
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,255
the worker threads retainer rings onto the lead screw.   

318
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,358
then he installs the lead screw
in the base.          

319
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:01,165
he places shuttle devices   
onto each end of the lead screw.

320
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,140
he inserts spacing blocks in the channel.        

321
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,542
he moves the shuttle devices forward,            

322
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,877
using the spacing blocks as guides           

323
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,813
for the correct positioning.  

324
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,283
after removing the spacing blocks,      

325
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,819
he adjusts the retainer rings. 

326
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,024
he places steel jaws on the shuttle devices     

327
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,126
and bolts them in place.    

328
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,700
once the thumb screw has been attached to the lead screw,  

329
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:39,170
the assembly is complete.   

330
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,840
now, it's over to a computerized
measuring station.       

331
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,509
the controller positions the vise in the equipment,   

332
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,578
then a probe moves in.     

333
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,515
the probe compares the coordinates of the vise  

334
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,849
to a computer model      

335
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,653
and checks that it measures up to standards.         

336
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,592
metalworking vises take four weeks to make    

337
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,228
and will hold up for many years.

338
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,606
