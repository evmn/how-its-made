00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:26,490
narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,427
toothpicks...

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,564
...acrylic bathtubs...

4
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,704
...helicopters...

5
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,043
and beer.

6
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:57,054
some people use them to hold
hors d'oeuvres together.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,522
kids make scale models

8
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,526
of famous buildings
and bridges out of them.

9
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,927
and some people
actually use them

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,796
for their primary purpose --

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,265
to remove food
caught between their teeth.

12
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,733
what are we talking about?

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,403
why, the humble toothpick,
of course.

14
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,943
logs -- lots of birch logs
are delivered to this factory.

15
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,514
they're the raw material from
which toothpicks will be made.

16
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,552
the heavy logs
are lifted by grippers

17
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,487
and placed into a debarker.

18
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,491
bark isn't part of the
toothpick-fabrication process

19
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,359
and is recovered
by this machine.

20
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,561
but the bark isn't thrown away.

21
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,097
it's sold
to a neighboring factory

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,133
where it will be used as fuel.

23
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,639
the debarker works in two steps.

24
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,843
with two passes,
it produces a log roll

25
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:55,613
that's perfectly cylindrical
and easier to mill.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,393
this log is being transported
to the next processing stage.

27
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,131
this unraveling machine
unravels the log

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,400
as if it were a roll of paper,

29
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,669
cutting it with 12 fine blades

30
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:23,207
each .04 of an inch thick
and 2 1/2 inches wide.

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,111
these same blades will be
used later to cut toothpicks.

32
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,622
then these 12 blades,

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,891
positioned side by side
on the unraveling machine,

34
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,028
will form rolls of strips
called "billets."

35
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,898
these tiny cutters are used to
trim the ends of the toothpicks.

36
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,301
knives placed here and there
on the machine

37
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,303
thin the ends of the toothpicks.

38
00:02:56,243 --> 00:03:01,879
the roller rolls up the cut
strips, forming a billet.

39
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:11,656
completed strips, or billets,
are taken out manually.

40
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,193
each billet weighs 4 pounds.

41
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,399
the billets are carried
to the puncher,

42
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,000
the flat-toothpick puncher

43
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,672
cuts the billet strips
into small, equal-sized pieces.

44
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,414
the cut pieces come out
at this end of the machine.

45
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,021
the punch works very rapidly.

46
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,224
knives come down
2,000 times per minute

47
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,462
to cut a total of 8,000
toothpicks in just 60 seconds.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,236
cut toothpicks fall into this
chute, then into a container.

49
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,705
at this stage, they're soft.

50
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,974
they have to be hardened
in a dryer for four hours

51
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,176
at 250 degrees fahrenheit.

52
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,180
then the toothpicks are
transferred to the polisher.

53
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,515
talcum powder and friction

54
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,184
help make the toothpicks
perfectly smooth.

55
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,920
this operation takes four hours.

56
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,724
toothpicks exit the polisher
and pass through this sifter,

57
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,726
which filters out broken ones.

58
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,731
those in good condition continue
on to an air-blower system.

59
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,267
damaged ones are rejected.

60
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,504
perfect toothpicks are placed
onto two conveyers

61
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,073
by an air-blowing system.

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,543
drums at the end
of the conveyors

63
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,345
assure quantity distribution,

64
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:45,950
then they're carried to
the automatic packagers.

65
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,621
this machine counts
the toothpicks.

66
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,226
boxes are made up,
ready for filling.

67
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,129
the number of toothpicks
included in each box matters.

68
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,231
the packager is calibrated

69
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,435
to place 650 toothpicks
in each container,

70
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,773
and it produces
about 1,150 boxes an hour.

71
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:14,245
it handles
747,500 toothpicks an hour.

72
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,916
some toothpicks
are individually wrapped

73
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,852
for distribution
to restaurants and airlines.

74
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,722
this machine wraps 1,200
toothpicks per minute.

75
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,392
it automatically wraps, glues,
and cuts the paper.

76
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,595
this facility can manufacture

77
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:36,067
more than 20 million toothpicks
every day.

78
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,004
and it all started
from several birch logs.

79
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:51,882
narrator: bathing daily is
a relatively new phenomenon,

80
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,417
historically speaking.

81
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,420
people used to take baths
only when necessary.

82
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,156
today whiling away the afternoon
in the tub

83
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,692
is more than a way
to wash our bodies.

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:07,965
with bubbles and bath oils, it
can be an experience in luxury.

85
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,036
modern bathtubs look nothing
like tubs of the middle ages

86
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,172
or those wooden tubs
we see in western films.

87
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,976
to achieve supreme comfort,
the designer explores new shapes

88
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,378
via computer
and design software,

89
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,849
tools which make for a speedy
review of various shapes.

90
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,384
then a model is produced.

91
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,986
this one, produced on a
1/6 scale, is made of cardboard.

92
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,190
but other models can be
made of clay, polystyrene,

93
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,993
or by stereolithography.

94
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:39,063
manufacturing begins
with an acrylic sheet.

95
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,399
it is heated to
about 390 degrees fahrenheit

96
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,067
with ceramic elements.

97
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,604
the sheet becomes soft
and malleable.

98
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,139
so that it takes
the form of the mold,

99
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,208
thousands of tiny holes
in the shell

100
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,577
suction the sheet by vacuum.

101
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,682
the mold must cool
before it can be opened.

102
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:02,018
powerful ventilators blow air
directly onto the mold,

103
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:07,291
lowering the temperature to
170 degrees in 4 to 6 minutes.

104
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:20,070
the ventilators
are then withdrawn.

105
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,779
then the shell
is easily removed from the mold.

106
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,082
it weighs a mere 35 pounds.

107
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,121
to make a tub in another shape,
they change the mold.

108
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,457
they put in
another acrylic sheet.

109
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,260
the sheet is heated on
the ceramic and fiberglass mold,

110
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:47,198
the little holes vacuum out air,
and the job is done.

111
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,869
the molded acrylic sheet

112
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:55,272
is not sturdy enough
to be filled with water,

113
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,976
so it must be reinforced
with fiberglass.

114
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,881
this is the fiberglass.

115
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:09,520
mixed with resin, it is blown
onto the mold by a robotic unit.

116
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,556
stored in reservoirs,

117
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,093
the resin is carried
to the robot by pumps.

118
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,299
here it produces
a chemical reaction

119
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,835
between the fiberglass
and the resin,

120
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,738
which produces
a reinforced shell.

121
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,134
laminating is one of
the most important steps.

122
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,536
with brush and roller,

123
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,873
they eliminate all air bubbles
that could weaken the tub.

124
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,943
this makes the fiberglass resin
adhere perfectly

125
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,211
to the acrylic shell.

126
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,879
the process takes 75 minutes.

127
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,084
the shell is then transported
to the milling department.

128
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,052
the shell is dry and hard.

129
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,021
they can extract it manually,

130
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,958
but here they use
digitally controlled machines.

131
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,293
the operation begins

132
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:25,195
with the trimming of the edges
of the bathtub.

133
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,635
during this process,

134
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,838
the robot will pierce openings
for the drains,

135
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,240
the whirlpool jets,

136
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,375
and the air jets
for the overflow

137
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,678
and for ambient light.

138
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:53,223
the bathtub, almost completed,
is now sent to another workshop.

139
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:59,196
they can now install the pump,
the piping, and the blower.

140
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,334
these last operations
are done manually.

141
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,270
the pump is installed
for the whirlpool system,

142
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,872
as well as the pvc pipes,

143
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,541
whose joints have been
hermetically sealed

144
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,444
to prevent any leaks.

145
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,686
finally, to make sure that
everything is functioning well,

146
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,556
each bathtub
undergoes a water test.

147
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,558
the tub is finally ready.

148
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:31,762
after 13 steps and anywhere from
three to five hours of work,

149
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,297
depending on the type of tub.

150
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,067
it almost invites you
to climb in.

151
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,243
narrator:
in the world of aeronautics,

152
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,780
the helicopter is
the ideal go-anywhere machine.

153
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:51,981
unlike airplanes,

154
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,718
choppers can move
in almost any direction

155
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,654
and take off and land
straight up and down.

156
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,057
now that we've "coptered"
your attention,

157
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,394
let's see what goes into
building these whirlybirds.

158
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,533
man has always wanted to fly.

159
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,537
and the versatility of
the helicopter has allowed him

160
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,272
to reach unexpected heights.

161
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,141
plans for a helicopter
are created

162
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,211
with catia 3-d design-assisting
computer software.

163
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,879
it takes 700 hours of work

164
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,617
between the drawing stage
and the assembly of the pattern.

165
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,153
the helicopter is made
of carbon fiber,

166
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:32,556
a composite material lighter
and stronger than steel,

167
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,225
protected by two layers
of green plastic.

168
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,029
the fiber is cut with a blade
controlled by ultrasound.

169
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,832
they lay on
several thicknesses of fiber

170
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,567
to make the rear fuselage.

171
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,970
the green light of a laser
helps position the parts.

172
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,441
then with a heat gun,
they apply a beehive web

173
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,544
which increases
the solidity of the structure.

174
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,183
but the carbon fiber
is still soft.

175
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,653
to harden, it must be baked
under pressure

176
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:07,457
for 10 hours in this autoclave
oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit.

177
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,661
the pieces exit the oven
and head for machining.

178
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,798
the door of the motor housing
is kept in a cutting jig

179
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,534
and is shaped
with a manual shaper.

180
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,336
before installing the parts,

181
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,806
they strike the carbon fiber
with a resonance hammer

182
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,207
to detect any faults.

183
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,878
the electrical harness
is mounted on a pattern

184
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,547
before being installed
in the aircraft.

185
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,686
this particular helicopter
has 2,570 yards of wiring,

186
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:39,489
but others can have
almost 6 miles.

187
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,425
the wiring will be connected
to the flight-instruments panel,

188
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,894
the brain of the helicopter.

189
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:51,034
this aircraft has 9,964 rivets
fastened with a gun and a ram.

190
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,836
they also apply a sealant

191
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,706
to prevent
corrosion-creating humidity.

192
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,911
they now assemble
the helicopter's rear fuselage.

193
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,783
piece by piece,
the aircraft takes shape.

194
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,553
they will install
mechanical components later.

195
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,930
the motor arrives.

196
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,668
this one weighs 260 pounds
and has to be carefully handled.

197
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,539
among the other parts
to be installed

198
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,877
is the circular plate on which
the blades will be attached.

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,812
safety is primary.

200
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,814
the screw-nut holes
are perforated,

201
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,416
allowing for the insertion
of the brake cable.

202
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,753
this tightly braided metal wire
prevents the nut from loosening,

203
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,889
due to strong vibrations.

204
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,491
now they bolt on
the four blades,

205
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,694
which makes the helicopter fly.

206
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,562
weighing 90 pounds each,

207
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,767
they're made of composite
materials and an aluminum alloy.

208
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,002
they're attached
to the main rotor.

209
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,575
the dashboard is installed
in the cockpit,

210
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,577
and all the wires are hooked up.

211
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,381
contact is established,
and all is functioning properly.

212
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,924
the last step -- finishing
the interior of the craft.

213
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,460
they install seats,
safety belts, the consoles,

214
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:28,065
bulkheads, windows and doors,
as well as the trimmings.

215
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,944
the helicopter
is almost completed,

216
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,447
but it still has to be painted.

217
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,950
when done,
the helicopter is towed

218
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,886
outside the assembly hangar.

219
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,420
flight tests are performed

220
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,490
to make sure that mechanical
and electrical components

221
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,559
are functioning properly.

222
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,303
it requires
an average of 110 days

223
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,572
to assemble
the more than 3,000 parts

224
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,108
of a helicopter like this one,

225
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,946
and they turn out
almost 185 units each year.

226
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:25,789
these 3-ton engines are capable
of reaching speeds of 140 knots

227
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:30,193
and flying at a maximum altitude
of 20,000 feet.

228
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,803
narrator: beer has been around

229
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,007
for as long
as civilization itself.

230
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,277
historical records show
that ancient peoples made beer

231
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,681
with barley, hops, water,
and yeast.

232
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,883
we still use
the same ingredients,

233
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,150
but as you'll see,

234
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:58,722
today's production technology
is far more complex.

235
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,699
beer has been drunk
since 4,000 b.c. in mesopotamia.

236
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,369
the sikaru made it
as a sacred beverage

237
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,371
from grains but without hops.

238
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,839
the gauls and the celts

239
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,109
drank a beverage made
with barley, wheat, and rye.

240
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,446
during the crusades,
europeans discovered spices

241
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:26,049
and flavored the beverage
with cinnamon and laurel.

242
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:30,186
in the 15th century, nordic
peoples used hops as a spice,

243
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,857
giving rise to the beer
we know today.

244
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,069
beer is a fermented beverage
made with cereals and water.

245
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,747
the company has its own
water-filtration plant.

246
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,349
it will be refiltered
before being used

247
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,351
to eliminate chlorine.

248
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,223
this materials tanks can hold
21,000 gallons of water.

249
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,026
between 11 and 16 tons of malt
and another grain are added.

250
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,294
they use dark malt,

251
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,664
which has been heat-treated
to a high temperature.

252
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,637
the mixture
will spend two hours here.

253
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,772
an agitator prevents malt husks

254
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,109
from settling
to the bottom of the tank.

255
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,912
turbulence from the pumps
during the transfer

256
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,681
causes the formation
of this protein foam.

257
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,654
the wort is in the process
of being extracted

258
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,988
and will be boiled.

259
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,026
about five hours have passed
since the brewing process began.

260
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,997
here they draw off a sample.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,266
they will make
other control tests

262
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,002
at various stages of brewing.

263
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:01,711
this is the draff, a solid
residue extracted from the wort.

264
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,114
it will be used as cattle feed.

265
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,952
here is a close-up view
of the draff.

266
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,092
then the liquid is filtered.

267
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,627
here's the filtration tank

268
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,297
where the wort is separated
from the malt husks.

269
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,099
a sample is withdrawn
from the wort heater

270
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,803
to verify the density of sugars
and the quality of the wort.

271
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,180
now another ingredient --
the hops --

272
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,182
is added into the wort heater.

273
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:43,253
the hops impart the bitterness
and aroma particular to beer.

274
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,123
the hops looks like this.

275
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,461
they can now start the brewing.

276
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,731
in the control room,
an operator handles

277
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,201
the data-control system
of the brewing process.

278
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,341
they add in the yeast, which
starts off the fermentation.

279
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,344
this process lasts
between 7 and 10 days.

280
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,680
this foam indicates
that fermentation has begun,

281
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,350
and sugars will now
transform into alcohol.

282
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,154
each fermentation tank
is computer-controlled

283
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,623
to maintain
a specific temperature.

284
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,224
during fermentation,

285
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,827
chemical reactions create
the scum that we see.

286
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,699
now aged for three weeks,
the beer is almost finished.

287
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,435
we see here the bottling tanks.

288
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,709
the beer has to be filtered
once more.

289
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,379
exiting these filters,
the wort is clarified,

290
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,447
then rid of the components

291
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,717
responsible for the cloudiness
of the beer.

292
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,787
here's the beer
filtered a second time...

293
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,990
and finally finished,
as a clear product.

294
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,396
used bottles are now washed.

295
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,899
after their wash cycle, the
bottles have become sterilized.

296
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,940
empty bottles arrive on
this plate, ready to be filled.

297
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:17,047
about 1,000 bottles a minute
are filled while on the move.

298
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,955
then they pass to the capper

299
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,459
before being sent
to the pasteurizer.

300
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,040
only two steps remain.

301
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,175
labels are glued
onto the bottles,

302
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,713
then they're sent by conveyor
to be put in cases.

303
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,590
made from water
and cereal grains,

304
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,327
the beer is now ready
to be consumed and enjoyed.
