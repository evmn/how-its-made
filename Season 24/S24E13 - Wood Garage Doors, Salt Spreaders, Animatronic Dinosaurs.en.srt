    discovery communications

00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,121
narrator: a garage door is more 
than just a functional component

4
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,190
           of a house.          

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,059
  it's part of the curb appeal, 

6
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,661
   especially when the garage   
     is prominently located     

7
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,731
    at the front of the home.   

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,733
      garage doors are made     
  from a variety of materials,  

9
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,136
 wood being the high-end option.

10
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,675
       a wood garage door       
 is pricier than standard steel,

11
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,745
 aluminum, or vinyl panel doors.

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,748
         but they offer         
  the most design flexibility.  

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,217
     wood can be customized     
          to any style          

14
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,420
     and painted or stained     
           any color.           

15
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:33,424
  western red cedar, mahogany,  
 and hemlock are popular choices

16
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,562
      because they hold up      
   particularly well outdoors.  

17
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,300
       garage doors start       
    with the core structure.    

18
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,904
      for the core surface,     
 they use exterior-grade plywood

19
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,307
 so that the indoor-facing side 
   of the core can be stained   

20
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,378
  to match the decorative wood  
      on the outdoor side.      

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,580
           they build           
  the core's internal structure 

22
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,816
      out of finger-jointed     
          yellow pine.          

23
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,852
 finger-jointed means each piece

24
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,789
       is made of several       
    short, connected pieces.    

25
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,524
   it is structurally stronger  

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,593
         and less prone         
     to twisting and bowing     

27
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,461
   than a solid piece of wood.  

28
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,734
      they build a core for     
each section of the garage door.

29
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,338
       the core structures      
         can be designed        

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,808
     to accommodate windows     
    or other unique features.   

31
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,680
          they insulate         
      every core structure      

32
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,548
   with pieces of polystyrene.  

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,485
   this helps keep the garage   
      warmer in the winter      

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,089
    and cooler in the summer.   

35
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,425
     now they run two sheets    
    of exterior-grade plywood   

36
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,096
  through a machine that coats  
  the top and bottom with glue. 

37
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,431
       they lay the sheets      
      onto a core structure     

38
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:50,835
     and place a second core    
 structure on top of the first. 

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,637
    they repeat this process    

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,973
    until they've stacked up    
     enough core structures     

41
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,775
      required for the door     
        they are making.        

42
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,381
       they put the stack       
  into a press for a half-hour. 

43
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:07,452
the press applies 130,000 pounds
      while the glue cures.     

44
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,389
   then they load each section  
         onto a machine,        

45
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,924
          which cuts it         
     to the width required.     

46
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,926
  the machine also makes a lip  

47
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,795
         to direct rain         
       away from the door       

48
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:21,600
    so that water doesn't run   
      back into the garage.     

49
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,868
when a core section has windows,

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,405
 they cut the openings for them 
         with a router.         

51
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,683
  using a template as a guide,  

52
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,420
    they drill holes through    
     the front of the core.     

53
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,290
    with a countersink tool,    

54
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,560
     they cut a wide opening    
        around each hole.       

55
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,064
      they insert "t" nuts      
         into the holes.        

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,701
      this enables hardware     
   to be mounted on the inside  

57
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,637
       of the garage door.      

58
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,744
         at this point,         
   the connected core sections  

59
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,714
 can function as a structurally 
       sound garage door.       

60
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,384
     however, there's still     
   aesthetic work left to do.   

61
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,390
 the plywood on the front of the
 door serves as a blank canvas. 

62
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,326
 they glue decorative wood trim 
        to the front door       

63
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:26,064
 to produce the design specified
    in the customer's order.    

64
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:30,001
         for this door,         
 they're using african mahogany.

65
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,004
   they've already cut pieces   
   to the required dimensions,  

66
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,007
  with tongue-and-groove edges  
  that enable adjoining pieces  

67
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,542
           to connect.          

68
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,413
      once the glue dries,      

69
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,849
  they cut off the excess wood  
         with a router.         

70
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,024
   then they sand the surface   
      and prepare the wood      

71
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,759
    to be stained or painted.   

72
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,495
   they line up the remaining   
          core section          

73
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,564
           and glue on          
  the corresponding wood trim.  

74
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,135
    they secure the wood trim   
     to the core with nails.    

75
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,590
        after cutting off       
 the last pieces of excess wood,

76
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,059
     they install the glass     
        for the windows.        

77
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,364
     the dealer will install    
   the hardware upon delivery.  

78
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,805
     prior to installation,     

79
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,873
        either the dealer       
         or the customer        

80
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,443
  will stain or paint the wood  
       the desired color.       

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,359
            narrator:           
     sand-and-salt spreaders    

82
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,894
         were developed         
      in the united states      

83
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,296
          in the middle         
      of the 20th century.      

84
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,433
          before that,          
  crews kept winter roads safe  

85
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,102
   by shoveling sand and salt   
          from trucks.          

86
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,573
        things got easier       
    when mechanical spreaders   

87
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,742
  took over the heavy lifting.  

88
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,179
      winter storm brewing?     

89
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,382
     sand-and-salt spreaders    
        have it covered.        

90
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,420
  they distribute salt to melt  
 the ice and sand for traction. 

91
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,526
 they start with two big sheets 
       of stainless steel.      

92
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,462
 computer-driven plasma torches 
         carve the steel        

93
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:42,267
 into the four panels that will 
  be used to build the hopper.  

94
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,203
       next, the operator       
      transfers the panels      

95
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:49,074
to another computerized machine.

96
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,276
          this one has          
      numerous punch tools.     

97
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:56,982
 they cut holes for nuts, bolts,
 bearings, and other components.

98
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,820
         then it's over         
   to a hydraulic press brake.  

99
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,423
       it bends the bottom      
       of the hopper panel      

100
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,092
      to create a wide rim.     

101
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,429
   this wide rim adds rigidity  
          to the part.          

102
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,830
         the team flips         
     the hopper panel around    

103
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,101
       so the press brake       
       can bend the top.        

104
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,405
   computerized stops control   
   the location of each bend.   

105
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,044
a worker clamps the hopper panel
   in a fixture to prop it up   

106
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:30,115
 while he welds ribbed supports 
         to the outside.        

107
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,651
    he adds two or three ribs   
       to each side panel,      

108
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:37,389
      depending on the size     
        of the spreader.        

109
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,191
        once all the ribs       
        have been welded,       

110
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,328
          a team joins          
the four hopper panels together.

111
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,034
 they clamp a bar across one end
   to square up the structure.  

112
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,240
once it's aligned, they weld the
  spreader hopper at the seams. 

113
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,479
        these tight seams       
    create a rugged structure   

114
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,148
        that will hold up       
        under the burden        

115
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,684
   of heavy road salt or sand.  

116
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,421
       now a worker builds      
         the steel chute        

117
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,325
      that the sand or salt     
       will flow through.       

118
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,829
  he attaches several brackets  
    to the inside and outside   

119
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,564
          of the chute.         

120
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,567
     these brackets are for     
   the adjustable steel flaps   

121
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,737
  that direct the flow of salt  
        onto the highway.       

122
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,644
  here he installs the adjuster 
    bar for one of the flaps.   

123
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,847
       he swings the flap       
   to confirm it moves freely.  

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,916
        a pin is inserted       
       in the adjuster bar      

125
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,187
         to set the flap        
     at the desired spacing.    

126
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:46,491
      he attaches a bearing     
   to each side of the chute.   

127
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,663
  he slides a long steel shaft  
      through the bearings      

128
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,999
       until it protrudes       
        from the bottom.        

129
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,136
      he secures the shaft      
       to the bearings...       

130
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:06,811
...and mounts a flexible plastic
spinner to the protruding shaft.

131
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,619
    this spinner will spread    
  the road salt or sand evenly  

132
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,721
        across the road.        

133
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:24,496
  customers on tighter budgets  
 sometimes choose salt spreaders

134
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,532
       made of mild steel       
      instead of stainless.     

135
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,638
  they spray a dry powder coat  
        onto these units.       

136
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,709
     then they roll the part    
   into an oven to bake it on.  

137
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,978
this durable finish will protect
   the hoppers from corrosion   

138
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,648
        and general wear.       

139
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,052
           now back to          
  the stainless-steel spreader. 

140
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,322
   the team fastens a gearbox   
   to the side of the hopper.   

141
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:53,525
   it will drive the conveyer   
   that delivers salt or sand   

142
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,260
          to the chute.         

143
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,332
   a worker temporarily powers  
    the gearbox with a drill    

144
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,268
  to assist in the installation 
        of the conveyer.        

145
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,906
 he pushes the conveyor forward 
 until the gearbox takes over.  

146
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,810
     he installs a feed gate    
         at the opening         

147
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,146
      and screws the lever      
   to the side of the hopper.   

148
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,887
 they stockpile hoppers, chutes,
      and motors separately     

149
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,623
    until an order is placed.   

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,094
    this allows the customer    
 to choose individual components

151
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,829
   before the final assembly.   

152
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,633
    for example, the customer   
 way want a specific gas motor, 

153
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,370
       or they may choose       
        a hydraulic one.        

154
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,773
       once they've bolted      
    the chute to the hopper,    

155
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:45,443
  this sand-and-salt spreader   
  is ready for an icy highway.  

156
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,912
     it can spread material     
         thick or thin,         

157
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,915
          depending on          
      the road conditions.      

158
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,398
       narrator: dinosaurs      
     have long been extinct.    

159
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,401
  but animatronics make models  

160
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,039
      look, sound, and move     
      like the real thing.      

161
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,409
    developed by walt disney    
          in the 1960s,         

162
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,714
 this technique is a combination
     of art and technology.     

163
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:29,220
         the slit eyes,         
      rows of sharp fangs,      

164
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:34,959
  and a long, purposeful snout  
    all look stunningly real.   

165
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,228
   with his razor-sharp claws,  

166
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,366
 this velociraptor figure looks 
   ready to leap right at you.  

167
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,570
        first, a designer       
   uses 3-d sculpting software  

168
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,575
      to create a detailed      
  digital model of the raptor.  

169
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,045
 key features, such as the size,
 shape, and number of the teeth 

170
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,048
   are thoroughly documented.   

171
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,518
    the art director approves   
 a small-scale 3-d printed model

172
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,720
          of the figure         

173
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,524
before an industrial robotic arm
  sculpts the full-size figure  

174
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,660
       in four-pound foam.      

175
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:14,265
     the density of the foam    
allows for very precise styling.

176
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,338
 an artist adds details by hand.

177
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,607
             he uses            
    precision sculpting tools   

178
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,543
   to draw wrinkles and lines.  

179
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,746
     he brushes melted clay     
       on top of the foam       

180
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,183
 to bring out details and give  
 more realism to the sculpture. 

181
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,754
   the clay needs to solidify   

182
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,090
      before the sculpture      
         can be molded.         

183
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,692
       a figure finisher        
       prepares a mixture       

184
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,429
     of monomer and polymer     
     that is commonly used      

185
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,365
     to make acrylic teeth.     

186
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,367
he pours the mixture into a mold

187
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,170
       shaped like the jaw      
         of the raptor.         

188
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,545
       he places the mold       
      in a vacuum chamber.      

189
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:07,919
 he seals the vacuum-chamber lid
   and starts the vacuum pump.  

190
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,788
   the vacuum pump will lower   
      the pressure inside,      

191
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,758
     forcing air bubbles out    
    from the acrylic mixture.   

192
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,831
     this process makes for     
 an even and consistent casting.

193
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:27,939
   these are sharp and strong   
       velociraptor fangs.      

194
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,409
       the figure finisher      
  separates the teeth by hand,  

195
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:36,214
then takes a dremel tool to file
down the excess around the base.

196
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,083
        the acrylic teeth       
 accurately reproduce the shape 

197
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,186
    of the predator's fangs.    

198
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,058
   the figure finisher places   
 the teeth back in the jaw mold.

199
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,963
massive teeth up to an inch long

200
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,567
       fill the reptile's       
        ferocious mouth.        

201
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,773
       the figure finisher      
        covers the teeth        

202
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,908
       with flesh-colored       
         dental acrylic         

203
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,778
        to form the gums        
   and palate of the creature.  

204
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,116
          once the mold         
     is filled with acrylic,    

205
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,620
 he puts it in a vacuum chamber,
 where the gums and palate cure.

206
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,258
  during the vacuuming process, 

207
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,728
the gums and teeth bond together

208
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,764
       to form a complete       
      velociraptor denture.     

209
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,138
 to make the reptile's eyeballs,

210
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,944
he places a transparent sheet in
 a vacuum thermoforming system. 

211
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,248
the vacuformer heats the plastic
      to make it malleable.     

212
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,153
 the figure finisher pushes the 
 sheet down on an eyeball shape 

213
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,288
  and activates a vacuum pump.  

214
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:57,294
  thermoformed eyeballs come in 
    various shapes and sizes.   

215
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,566
    now a plastics technician   
  prepares the fiberglass mold. 

216
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,903
 he uses a chopper gun to cover 
 the inside of the plastic mold 

217
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,673
          with flexible         
       fiberglass strands.      

218
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,946
      the technician bonds      
the strands together with resin.

219
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,118
    once the resin has cured,   

220
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,853
    the hard fiberglass shell   
         takes the shape        

221
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,189
 of the initial foam sculpture. 

222
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,060
         using a jigsaw,        

223
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,863
     a worker cuts the shell    
 at various articulation points.

224
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,466
   this will allow the figure   
       to move seamlessly       

225
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,203
   once it's assembled on its   
 animated mechanical structure. 

226
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,975
     the technician applies     
 a primer coat with a spray gun.

227
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,481
      this shell will house     
   the mechanical components,   

228
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,284
    animating the dinosaur's    
           long tail,           

229
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,421
 its strong upper body and neck,

230
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,756
       the birdlike head,       

231
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:03,061
    the handlike front limb,    
   and its powerful hind legs.  

232
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,372
   narrator: an encounter with  
  a life-size animated dinosaur 

233
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,241
     is quite an experience.    

234
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,644
 an elaborate range of advanced 
   special-effects techniques   

235
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,948
   and animatronic technology   
      brings them to life.      

236
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,923
       a technician covers      
   the fiberglass inner shell   

237
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,725
  with a ripstop fabric lining. 

238
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,862
  it will support and reinforce 
       the silicone skin.       

239
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,100
      she installs zippers      
 on the liner to easily take off

240
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,468
       or put on the skin.      

241
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,139
     the liner fits tightly     
       over the fiberglass      

242
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:52,143
       and takes the shape      
       of the inner shell.      

243
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,345
         technicians use        
     liquid-silicone rubber     

244
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,947
   to make the figure's skin.   

245
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,151
 one technician connects a tube 

246
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,220
         to the shell's         
       mold-injection port      

247
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,756
   while the other technician   

248
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,559
            operates            
    a high-pressure injector.   

249
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:12,330
   the machine pumps silicone   
         into the mold.         

250
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,904
    the silicone cures inside   
    the mold for a few hours.   

251
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,907
        then a technician       
       unfastens the bolts      

252
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,810
   that are holding the shell   
         tightly closed.        

253
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,782
        technicians take        
        the silicone skin       

254
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,118
out of the injection shell mold.

255
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,855
    they inspect the skin to    
 make sure there are no defects 

256
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,826
 and that it mimics the features
 of the initial foam sculpture. 

257
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,400
they take the skin off the inner
   shell for manual touch-ups.  

258
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,339
     a technician cleans up     
     the edges of the skin      

259
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:59,677
 by trimming off small silicone 
     strips called flashing.    

260
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,950
 with small precision scissors, 

261
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,953
   she meticulously trims off   
        all the flashing        

262
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,656
 to make clean, seamless joints.

263
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,763
   a figure finisher inserts    
   the molded acrylic denture   

264
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:24,835
        to check its fit        
     in the lower jaw skin.     

265
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,838
        he checks the fit       
   of the thermoformed eyeball  

266
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,841
 between the skin and the shell.

267
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,181
       a character painter      
        uses an airbrush        

268
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,518
        to paint the skin       
      with silicone paint.      

269
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,787
     he adds multiple layers    
            of paint,           

270
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,391
        giving the finish       
  much more detail and realism. 

271
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:51,862
 a machinist mills a mechanical 
    part for the metal frame.   

272
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:57,267
thousands of stainless-steel and
aluminum pieces need machining. 

273
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:03,074
 he bores out holes for bearings
       inside each shaft.       

274
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:07,211
  each piece can be customized  
  to suit virtually any design  

275
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,549
    and assembly requirement.   

276
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:16,420
     an electronics engineer    
      tests a control card.     

277
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,357
     each animated component    
   of the figure is controlled  

278
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,826
    by a card like this one.    

279
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,095
    the electronics engineer    
        connects the card       

280
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,631
     to an oscillator tester    

281
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,433
   to verify that the cylinder  
       responds accurately      

282
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,638
 to the electronic-input signal.

283
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,707
     a program on the card      
     allows precise control     

284
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,643
over the motion of the cylinder.

285
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,712
  the cylinders create motion,  

286
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,582
    while the aluminum frame    
    functions as the skeleton   

287
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,751
    supporting the movement.    

288
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,522
      an animator assembles     
          various parts         

289
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,592
  into the mechanical assembly. 

290
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,531
     he connects a cylinder     
       to the metal frame.      

291
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,467
   each cylinder is dedicated   
     to a specific function     

292
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,136
   in the mechanical assembly.  

293
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,340
     this cylinder activates    
 a finger in the hand assembly, 

294
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:13,444
     allowing it to curl up     
  in a smooth, seamless motion. 

295
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,683
      the animator attaches     
  the hand assembly to the arm, 

296
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,019
    bolts it on at the elbow,   

297
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:26,757
   and screws claws on the tip  
         of each finger.        

298
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,494
  the full frame of the figure  
  is assembled on a test bench. 

299
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,699
    a hydraulics-and-plumbing   
            engineer            

300
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,834
 opens the compressed-air valve,

301
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,104
          which powers          
    the pneumatic cylinders.    

302
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,241
      the show controller       
      runs random programs      

303
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,777
      to test the response      
  of the animatronic dinosaur.  

304
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,779
           they check           
     air-pressure variations    

305
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,114
in the hydraulic-cylinder tubes,

306
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,719
 as well as electronic direction
     and amplitude commands.    

307
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:58,522
   a creative director finally  
    puts his seal of approval   

308
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,957
         on the figure.         

309
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,594
a lot of effort goes into making
     such a complex machine     

310
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,030
  look like a living creature.  

311
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,941
