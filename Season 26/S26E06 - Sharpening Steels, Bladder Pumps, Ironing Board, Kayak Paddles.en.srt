00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:57,323
    a well-made knife is an     
essential tool in any kitchen.  

4
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,257
      having a sharp blade      
     can be the difference      

5
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,661
     between a perfect meal     
   and a culinary nightmare.    

6
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,197
           no matter            
  how expensive the knife is,   

7
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,932
    it will dull with use.      

8
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,600
    a high-quality sharpening   
             steel              

9
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,170
     can restore any knife      
     to its former glory.       

10
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,744
 professional-grade sharpening  
  steels have an oval shape.    

11
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,614
     the shape provides more    
             surface            
 area for efficient sharpening  

12
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,149
     and allows pro chefs       

13
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,752
      to hone their blades      
   frequently as they work.     

14
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,228
   the manufacturing process    
     begins with a machine      

15
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,966
     that quickly cuts rods     
        of oval steel.          

16
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,434
      from handle to tip,       

17
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:44,837
 the finished sharpening steel  
     will be 12.5 inches.       

18
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,976
      a custom-made lathe       
        grips the rods          

19
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,645
        and guides them         
    inside a cutting area.      

20
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:58,717
  the lathe rounds off one end  
   to fit inside the handle.    

21
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,121
    it sprays the steel with    
             cooling            
 liquid to prevent overheating  

22
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,590
  during the cutting process.   

23
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:12,264
    next, they use a device     
   called a drawing machine.    

24
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,999
       ultra-fine teeth         

25
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,403
   scrape the steel to create   
     an abrasive sharpening     
            surface.            

26
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,871
  the grain of the abrasions    

27
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:24,076
  runs parallel to the length   
         of the steel.          

28
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:27,146
 the steel is still soft enough 
    for a stamping machine      

29
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,581
 to punch in the company logo.  

30
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,154
          in an oven,           
   they heat the steel rods     

31
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,290
     to 1,500 fahrenheit.       

32
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,093
 then, a machine dips the rods  
    in a pool of saltwater,     

33
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,495
        to harden them.         

34
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,702
     the sharpening steel       

35
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:53,972
     is now 20% harder than     
  the average kitchen knife.    

36
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,476
  a worker dips the components  
               in               
   a series of baths to clean   
             them.              

37
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,116
        next, a machine         
     with multiple nozzles      

38
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,852
          blasts sand           
  onto the sharpening steels.   

39
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,188
      the sand cleans off       
     the residue left over      

40
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,190
  from the production process   

41
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,159
     and prepares the steel     
      for chrome plating.       

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,501
  the chrome plating protects   
    the surface from rust.      

43
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,475
    an enormous industrial-     
      strength dishwasher       

44
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:33,011
 cleans the sharpening steels.  

45
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,814
     then, workers conduct      
 a quality-control inspection   

46
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,285
        of the abrasive         
     sharpening surfaces.       

47
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,752
     the sharpening steels      

48
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,155
       have been changed        
    from their original oval    
             shape.             

49
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,828
  using a set of high-speed,    

50
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,097
      specially calibrated      
        sanding belts,          

51
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,102
 a preprogrammed robot smooths  
     and shapes the steel.      

52
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:04,042
      the final piece has       
 a polished and rounded look.   

53
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,912
       a grinding machine       
  carefully tapers the metal    

54
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,814
       to give the steel        
     its sword-like shape.      

55
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:16,055
  it takes more than 50 steps   
 to create a sharpening steel.  

56
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,057
        a machining tool        
        drills and taps         

57
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,593
        the rounded end         
   of the sharpening steel.     

58
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,229
  this creates a threaded hole  
    for attaching a handle.     

59
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,435
 the handle includes a section  
       that folds down,         

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,705
   allowing it to double as a   
             hook.              

61
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,278
     a worker applies glue      
    and installs two rivets     

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,914
    to hold the wood section    
    of the handle in place.     

63
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:48,053
  the wood handle is carved out 
               of               
     a 100-year-old oak wine    
            barrel.             

64
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
       a worker carefully       
sands the edges of the handle,  

65
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,562
    ensuring a smooth grip.     

66
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,367
     another worker applies     
  a protective coating of wax   

67
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,935
      to the wood handle.       

68
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:09,508
  a worker installs the third   
       and final rivet.         

69
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,912
 it bears the company's logo.   

70
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,446
 they install this rivet last   

71
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,683
      so it's not damaged       
 during the finishing process.  

72
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,390
    after a final cleaning,     

73
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,494
    the sharpening steels are   
              ready             
   to be packed up and shipped  
              out.              

74
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,607
   it takes a lot of slicing,   
     chopping, and dicing       

75
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:46,011
   to make a great meal, but,   
 with a good sharpening steel,  

76
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,446
    cutting is never dull.      

77
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,900
       environmental laws       
    require many industries     

78
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,370
     to monitor groundwater     
      for contamination.        

79
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,172
      an engineering firm       
       is usually hired         

80
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,975
   to collect the groundwater   
     samples for testing.       

81
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,179
   some firms collect samples   
     using a bladder pump.      

82
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,415
 it's a small device that pumps 
  water using pressured air.    

83
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,854
   it's called a bladder pump   
    because the flexible tube   
             inside             

84
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,657
   works like a human bladder   
   connected to a catheter.     

85
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,861
 when compressed, it forces the 
  groundwater out of the pump   

86
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,398
      and into the sample       
     collection container.      

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,133
        the pump is made        
       from polyethylene        

88
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,403
    because it's flexible and   
             inert.             

89
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:48,006
    the plastic is immune to    
     chemical or biological     
           reactions            

90
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:52,077
     that could contaminate     
       the water sample.        

91
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,412
       the extruder melts       
   the polyethylene pellets     

92
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,417
     and forces the liquid      
  through a tube-shaped eye.    

93
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,287
    then, it uses cold water    
to cool and solidify the poly.  

94
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,189
 this produces a 1-inch tube.   

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,228
     a razor cutter slices      
     the tube into either       

96
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:16,034
  15- or 32-inch-long pieces,   
  depending on the pump size.   

97
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,635
   they use a different eye     

98
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,506
 to produce a wider pvc plastic 
 tube for the pump's housing.   

99
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,377
         this tube goes         
  on a computer-guided lathe,   

100
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,914
    which cuts threads on the   
             ends.              

101
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,116
      the same lathe works      
  with a computer-guided mill   

102
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,252
 to shape the pump's top cap.   

103
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:37,256
     it's also made from pvc    
            plastic.            

104
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,859
   they make the pump's bottom  
               cap              
 and bladder cap the same way.  

105
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:46,731
     the lathe also carves      
a solid rod of stainless steel  

106
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,134
    into a small disc-shaped    
            weight.             

107
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,136
 the weight helps the pump sink 
         in the water           

108
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,871
   and collect the samples.     

109
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,211
 a technician preps the weights 
        for engraving.          

110
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,316
     he sprays them to hide     
     their shiny surface.       

111
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,687
     without this masking,      
           the laser            

112
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,323
 would bounce off the surface,  
  instead of penetrating it.    

113
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,127
   he loads the weights into    

114
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,066
 the computer-guided engraving  
  machine, then starts it up.   

115
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,437
  the laser engraves the name   
     of the manufacturer,       

116
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,773
    the pump's model number,    
        serial number,          

117
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,408
and other product information.  

118
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:39,585
      when the engraving is     
            complete,           
   he separates the weights     

119
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,054
   and washes off the coating   
          with water.           

120
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,526
        next, they make         
     the air supply line.       

121
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,131
    they mix 2% concentrated    
   blue polyethylene pellets    

122
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,666
   with 98% colorless ones.     

123
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,538
   they use the same extruder   
           as before            

124
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,540
   to create a narrow tube;     

125
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,877
      as well as an opaque      
      polyethylene tube,        

126
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,712
for the pump's discharge line.  

127
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,617
       then, they combine       
        the air supply          

128
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,953
   and water discharge tubes    
 with a heat-bonding machine.   

129
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,423
         it bonds them          
     in 6-inch intervals.       

130
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,159
   this lets engineers in the   
             field              

131
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,194
         cut the tubes          
   to the length they need.     

132
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,167
   now, it's time to assemble   
       the bladder pump.        

133
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,836
     they fit the top of the    
            bladder             

134
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,605
      into a cap that has       
     a hollow center rod.       

135
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,843
   they place an o-ring seal    
      around another cap        

136
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,979
      and attach that cap       
 to the bottom of the bladder.  

137
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,315
 the o-ring will prevent water  
 from leaking out of the pump   

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,251
   and air from seeping in.     

139
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,323
   they insert a ball-shaped    
     valve in the top cap.      

140
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:56,128
  then, they attach a hose bar  
               for              
connecting the discharge line.  

141
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,430
    they insert the bladder     
   into the pump's housing.     

142
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,602
   they connect an air supply   
           hose barb            

143
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,704
   next to the discharge hose   
             barb.              

144
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,344
     they place the weight      
 on the bottom cap of the pump  

145
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,813
       and insert another       
      ball-shaped valve.        

146
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,284
     they complete the pump     
  by attaching the bottom cap   

147
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,686
 to the bottom of the bladder.  

148
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,891
    when engineers submerge     
      the pump in a well,       

149
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,262
    water enters through the    
             bottom             
 and slowly fills the bladder.  

150
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,365
   they drive compressed air    
     into the pump housing      

151
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,902
   via the air supply tube.     

152
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:40,506
 the pressurized air surrounds  
  the bladder, squeezing it.    

153
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,106
  this forces the lower ball    

154
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,108
    to close off the bottom     
         of the pump,           

155
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,178
   trapping the water sample    
      inside the bladder.       

156
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,182
   the trapped water moves the  
              ball              
    at the top of the pump,     

157
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,718
 which clears the exit route.   

158
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,654
 then, they send bursts of air  
      to the pump in timed      
           intervals.           

159
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,858
     each burst squeezes the    
            bladder.            

160
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,929
    this gradually forces the   
              water             
sample to the top of the pump.  

161
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,766
      it's then collected       
in a container on the surface.  

162
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,817
     it helps to have a flat    
            surface             

163
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,152
      when you're ironing       
      wrinkled clothing.        

164
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,621
   the first ironing boards     

165
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:33,292
   were simple wooden panels    
  held up at ends by chairs.    

166
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,494
    folding legs were added     
         in the 1860s,          

167
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,230
      creating a standalone     
           structure            

168
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:40,599
    that could be collapsed     
       for easy storage.        

169
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,971
    this professional ironing   
             board              

170
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,907
          is equipped           
   for every pressing need.     

171
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,441
      its heated surface        

172
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:54,379
   ensures that every garment   
is expertly steamed or ironed.  

173
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,915
       each board starts        
   with a hand-drawn design     

174
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,918
         that includes          
    detailed measurements.      

175
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,455
  they upload the information   
        to a computer.          

176
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,723
     computer-guided tools      

177
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,061
 cut the ironing board surface  
         out of steel.          

178
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:13,265
    then, they drill 300 vent   
             holes.             

179
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,868
   a machine melts and molds    
    plastic under pressure.     

180
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,339
 it creates 20 different parts, 
 including this control panel.  

181
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,809
          the plastic           
   is a strong polycarbonate    

182
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:28,613
  that won't deteriorate when   
    exposed to the heat of an   
             iron.              

183
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,148
 the molded components include  

184
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,883
      the ironing board's       
        base structure          

185
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,355
    and numerous body parts     
       and attachments.         

186
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,757
       a worker assembles       
       the fan's motor.         

187
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,893
  the fan will blow the fabric  
       for easy steaming        

188
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,296
     or suction the fabric      
   to keep it on the board.     

189
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,070
    he secures the fan shaft    
 to the base plate and motor.   

190
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,577
  he flips the structure over   

191
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,780
    and installs a small fan    
    for cooling the motor.      

192
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,055
   he fastens the cooling fan   
   to the shaft with a clip.    

193
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,326
        next, he inserts        
      a metal base plate        

194
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,663
     in the ironing board's     
    molded plastic housing.     

195
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:25,270
   he places an electric coil   
     underneath the ironing     
            surface.            

196
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,077
       he bends the tabs        
     on the plate around the    
            element             

197
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,912
    to secure it in place.      

198
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,352
    he then makes the makes     
  the electrical connections.   

199
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,056
   he installs the perforated   
      steel plate on top.       

200
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,696
   then, he screws the plate    
   to the rest of the unit.     

201
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,774
   he flips the ironing board   
    over and tucks the fan      

202
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,776
   into a molded plastic slot   
         in the back.           

203
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,216
  he screws the fan to the rim  
  of the plastic compartment.   

204
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,159
 he transfers the ironing table 
to a rack until the next step.  

205
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,864
   when the worker's ready,     

206
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,336
   he places the central body   
              part              
 over the fan and electronics.  

207
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,338
     he attaches the wired      
         control panel          

208
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,073
    to the end of the ironing   
             board.             

209
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:45,283
  he drives large pins into it  
               to               
     secure it to the molded    
            casing.             

210
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,552
  he connects the the control   
       panel to the fan,        

211
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,821
      the heating element,      
        the thermostat,         

212
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,490
 and the temperature sensors.   

213
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:56,428
      he tucks the wiring       
  into the central body part.   

214
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,764
      he attaches a latch       
  for accessing the mechanics   

215
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:01,366
     of the ironing board.      

216
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,501
    then, he screws a molded    
      plastic side plate        

217
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,705
   to the central body part.    

218
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,773
 he closes the control panel,   

219
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,177
     encasing the mechanics     
     of the ironing board.      

220
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,446
      he secures the legs       
   to the central body part     

221
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,380
   using a pivot mechanism.     

222
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,183
      in this professional      
        ironing board,          

223
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:21,653
     the work surface folds     
         and unfolds.           

224
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,556
  the legs will remain stable   
         at all times.          

225
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,464
    he secures the legs with    
 the molded plastic structure.  

226
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,599
       he turns the knob        
    on the pivot mechanism      

227
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,901
  to set the board's height.    

228
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,205
     he peels the protective    
            plastic             

229
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,275
     off of the perforated      
       steel structure.         

230
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,217
    he fits an elastic cover    
             snugly             
    over the ironing board.     

231
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,219
    it's made of breathable,    
       synthetic fabric         

232
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,387
       and foam padding.        

233
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,694
        the worker tests        
      the ironing board.        

234
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,097
  he sets plastic-covered pods  
     on the ironing board.      

235
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,968
 he activates the blow function 
   and the plastic expands.     

236
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,970
       then, he activates       
      the suction option        

237
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,505
  and the plastic collapses.    

238
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,580
   the tests confirm that the   
 ironing board works properly,  

239
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,550
   ensuring that these ironing  
              jobs              
    will go more smoothly.      

240
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,801
 kayaking with a proper paddle  
    can make the experience     

241
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,403
        more comfortable        
      and more efficient        

242
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,939
 for a longer period of time.   

243
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,474
  paddle designs are different  
    for flatwater kayaking,     

244
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,478
  versus whitewater kayaking.   

245
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,079
 within both those categories,  

246
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:58,216
 there are many different blade 
   shapes and shaft designs.    

247
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,556
       this is a premium        
     touring kayak paddle.      

248
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,428
   it's designed to be stiff,   
 strong, and very lightweight.  

249
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,365
    the angle of the blades     
 is called the feather angle.   

250
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,167
      kayakers can adjust       
       the feather angle        

251
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,703
       for wrist comfort        
       and aerodynamics.        

252
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,742
   the first step is to make    
    the mold for the blade.     

253
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,912
         it's comprised         
    of many complex parts.      

254
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,082
   each one is shaped out of    
  a block of copper or steel.   

255
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,526
    this is a high-precision    
           process.             

256
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,062
        producing a mold        
   for just one blade style     

257
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,264
     costs about $100,000.      

258
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,936
    once all the components     
          are ready,            

259
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,939
  workers assemble the mold.    

260
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,542
          the corners           
   have long alignment pins.    

261
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,944
    the pins guide the mold     

262
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,613
     as it opens and closes     
    on the injection press.     

263
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,421
     workers mount the mold     
         on the press,          

264
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,491
  then load transparent nylon   
   pellets into the hopper.     

265
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,564
     they position a black      
       reinforcement rib        

266
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:23,701
    inside the blade mold.      

267
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,705
  the press closes and injects  
       hot, melted nylon        

268
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,173
     into the mold cavity.      

269
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:31,909
 then, the press cools the mold 
   and solidifies the nylon.    

270
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:36,180
   the mold opens and ejects    
       the kayak blade,         

271
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,284
  which is now reinforced with  
  the newly incorporated rib.   

272
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,857
  this entire molding process   
       takes 3 minutes.         

273
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,397
      the press only molds      
     a preliminary shape.       

274
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,732
   next, they clamp the blade   
         to a template          

275
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,868
          and start up          
   a computer-guided router.    

276
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,774
    the computer contours the   
              blade             
      to its final shape.       

277
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:11,816
        here's the blade        
  before and after this step.   

278
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,086
       the shaft is made        
    of molded carbon fiber.     

279
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,556
    each paddle is comprised    
  of two connecting sections.   

280
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,694
   workers prepare a right and  
              left              
 shaft piece for each paddle.   

281
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,364
       they saw each one        
    to the required length      

282
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,034
   and cut orientation slots    
          in the end.           

283
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:32,503
      the orientation slots     
            correctly           
      position the piece,       

284
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,840
 relative to the feather angle  
     adjustment mechanism.      

285
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,576
 they roughen the surface area  
      with a belt sander        

286
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,878
     to optimize adhesion.      

287
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,518
    they apply a fifth layer    
       of epoxy glue...         

288
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,325
     then insert the shaft      
        into the blade.         

289
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,469
  they wipe away the excess,    

290
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,372
     then let the glue dry      
         for 24 hours.          

291
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,344
     next, they assemble the    
             feather            
  angle adjustment mechanism.   

292
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,481
       they place a nylon       
   retaining cap on a spring    

293
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,083
     and insert the spring      
     into a nylon housing.      

294
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,152
  they flip the assembly over   

295
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,688
        and put it into         
     an ultrasonic welder.      

296
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,690
        then, they place        
     another retaining cap      

297
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,893
     on the other end of the    
            spring.             

298
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,363
      the welder uses high      
           frequencies          
       to generate heat.        

299
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,099
    the heat melts the nylon    
       and quickly fuses        

300
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,068
    the second retaining cap    
        to the housing.         

301
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,241
      they attach the part      
  to the rest of the paddle.    

302
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,245
       then, they glue it       
  into the right shaft piece.   

303
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,580
they wipe away the excess glue  

304
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,918
  and attach the final section  
 of the adjustment mechanism.   

305
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,122
   they wrap tape around the    
mechanism to contain the glue.  

306
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,857
   after the glue has dried,    

307
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,059
     they connect the right     
 and left sides of the paddle   

308
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,196
        with the feather        
       angle adjustment.        

309
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,531
          they put it           
     in the lock position,      

310
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,533
       which is indicated       
       by a white line.         

311
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,272
       they apply a decal       
 denoting the feather angles;   

312
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:18,342
     then, a second decal,      
   illustrating how to select   
             them.              

313
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:23,214
  a third decal with the brand  
    name goes on the blade.     

314
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,750
  adjusting the feather angle   
          is simple.            

315
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:29,020
  first, you push the left and  
right shafts toward the middle  

316
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,756
        and rotate them         
     to the desired angle.      

317
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,091
  then, you pull them apart,    

318
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,360
           to lock it           
  in the new blade position.    

319
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,495
 some paddle models do not have 
  feather angle adjustments,    

320
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,766
  however, every kayak paddle   
     this company produces      

321
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:46,237
   separates into two pieces,   
 to make transporting easier.
