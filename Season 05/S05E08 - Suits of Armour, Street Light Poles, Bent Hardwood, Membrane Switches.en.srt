00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,424
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,093
suits of armor...       

3
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,565
...street-light bulbs...    

4
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,705
...bent hardwood...      

5
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,677
...and membrane switches.   

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,319
if you're the type of guy   

7
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,187
who finds wearing a tie uncomfortable,      

8
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,057
try sporting a suit of armor. 

9
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,794
armor reached its peak during the battle-filled 15th century.

10
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,262
initially, it was made of chain mail,         

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,331
tiny rings of metal linked together.        

12
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,866
then, for greater protection, 

13
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,734
knights began wearing plate armor,          

14
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,271
suits made from large pieces of steel.           

15
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,079
today, armorers make this obsolete battle gear   

16
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,948
mostly for historical re-enactment buffs.      

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,551
this workshop specializes in custom-made suits of armor. 

18
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,888
the armorer has to take 45 different measurements   

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,689
just to prepare the pattern.  

20
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,693
he traces each pattern piece on a steel sheet        

21
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,030
that's about 1/16 of an inch thick.       

22
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,166
then he cuts along the trace line with a band saw.

23
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:46,037
this is the breastplate, which covers the chest and abdomen.  

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:50,175
now he begins to shape the piece
using an automatic hammer.   

25
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,310
there's no mold or template to guide him.         

26
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,080
he works strictly by eye.   

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,191
now that he has the basic shape,

28
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,593
he refines it using a manual hammer.        

29
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,530
he strikes the metal against an upright log,    

30
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,265
a bag of lead beads cushioning the blows.     

31
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,735
this prevents the metal from deforming.        

32
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,072
a few lighter blows without cushioning in select spots   

33
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,674
to finalize the shape.     

34
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:26,544
until now, he's been hammering the inside of the breastplate. 

35
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,147
now he works the outside.   

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,951
he smoothes the metal surface, a process known as planishing. 

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,093
now, using a different automatic hammerhead,      

38
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,562
he stretches out the breastplate's bottom edge 

39
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,931
to form a rim angling outward. 

40
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,301
he places the piece on an anvil,

41
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:55,240
then, using a manual hammer, planishes the rim.       

42
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,309
when you wear this heavy metal breastplate,       

43
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,178
the rim takes some of the weight
off your shoulders       

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,914
by distributing it over your hips.        

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,989
the armorer checks the shape, 

46
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,792
then makes any necessary adjustments.   

47
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,733
now, using several different hammers again,    

48
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,670
he works his way around the rest
of the breastplate,      

49
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:28,807
gradually rolling the edge onto
itself to form a rounded lip. 

50
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,709
rolling the metal onto itself to form the lip        

51
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,511
reinforces the perimeter of the breastplate,      

52
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,914
and the rounded edge prevents the sharp metal    

53
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,382
from cutting the skin.     

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
the breastplate is now ready for the finishing touches.   

55
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,923
first, the armorer smoothes the surface      

56
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,526
with medium-grit sandpaper... 

57
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,262
then with fine-grit sandpaper...

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,797
then -- the last step --    

59
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,234
with fine-grit paper and a polishing compound.   

60
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,872
some breastplates have an articulated styling.  

61
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,008
for this model, the armorer uses three brass rivets    

62
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,211
to attach the sections.    

63
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:43,482
he fastens them loosely to enable the pieces to move. 

64
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,728
then, using rivets again, he attaches leather straps.  

65
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,101
a suit of armor is made up of about 20 different components, 

66
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,204
such as the front and back shin guards called grieves... 

67
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,142
...armor-and-leather gloves called gauntlets...      

68
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,782
...shoulder pieces called pauldrons...      

69
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,855
...and, of course, the helmet and visor.     

70
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,591
a knight would don a suit of armor from the bottom up,  

71
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,860
otherwise the weight of the top components     

72
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,730
would have him keeling over, half-dressed.         

73
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,198
in the middle ages,      

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,068
a suit of armor cost as much as a small farm.    

75
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,404
it was a prized luxury only the nobility could afford.

76
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,206
being a modern-day knight in shining armor    

77
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,142
doesn't come cheap, either.  

78
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:47,078
a base-model suit costs about $3,000,      

79
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,349
an elaborate one up to $20,000.

80
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,359
narrator: we take well-lit streets for granted, 

81
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,761
but there was a time when venturing out at night  

82
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,096
meant traveling in complete darkness.     

83
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,632
in 1814, the first gas lights 

84
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,901
lit up the streets of london, england.      

85
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,569
the first electric streetlights

86
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,708
illuminated a public square in cleveland, ohio, in 1879.  

87
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:24,116
these streetlight poles are made
of what's called composite,  

88
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,785
a combination of fiberglass and epoxy resin.        

89
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:31,056
epoxy resin is a gooey, liquid plastic mixed with a hardener. 

90
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,459
the factory constructs each pole
on a mandrel,         

91
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,728
a long, tapered metal cylinder.

92
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,796
workers first lubricate the surface.          

93
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,466
then they take what's called a fiberglass filament,     

94
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:45,670
a string composed of 2,200 tiny fiberglass strands.    

95
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,740
they'll wind dozens of filaments
around the mandrel       

96
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,141
to create the pole,      

97
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,879
but first, the filaments go through a bath of epoxy resin. 

98
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,414
this resin is moldable     

99
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,651
and, once it's heat-cured, maintains its shape.      

100
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,494
once the filaments come out of the bath,     

101
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,229
a machine called a filament winder    

102
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,431
wraps them around the rotating mandrel.     

103
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,632
the speed of rotation     

104
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,369
in relation to the speed of the winder is critical   

105
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,372
because it dictates the angles of the fibers.         

106
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,041
the lower the angle, the more that part of the pole 

107
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,043
will be able to withstand the wind            

108
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,980
and provide constant, stable lighting.        

109
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,317
when a pole bends in the wind, the light appears to flicker.  

110
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,924
the number of filament layers 

111
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,726
depends on the design of each specific pole,     

112
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,395
and that's determined by a couple of factors.    

113
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,599
first, the type of light fixture
the pole will hold --     

114
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,069
the bigger the fixture, the stiffer the pole has to be.

115
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:53,004
the other factor is wind.   

116
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,575
the windier the location,   
the stronger the pole has to be.

117
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,214
once the winding's done,    

118
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,883
the mandrel moves on to the curing station.     

119
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,551
they pump pressurized steam  

120
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,287
into the hollow inside of the mandrel.        

121
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,623
the heat kick-starts      
the hardener in the epoxy resin.

122
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,294
this solidifies the resin and cures it.         

123
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,830
the mandrel rotates so that the pole cures evenly. 

124
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,099
curing time depends on the length of the pole   

125
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,668
and how many filaments it's made of.         

126
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,919
to help extract the pole,   

127
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,854
they pump cold water through the mandrel.      

128
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,925
this makes the steel mandrel contract, loosening the pole. 

129
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,262
remember how workers lubricated
the surface of the mandrel   

130
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,197
before winding the filaments? 

131
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,066
because of that, the pole just slides off.   

132
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,619
the pole now moves on to the finishing stages.    

133
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,488
first, an automated sander works the surface.       

134
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,358
the customer can order from a choice of surface textures, 

135
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,293
from smooth to rough.     

136
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,229
sanding takes just a few minutes.         

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,634
now a saw makes a neat cut at the top of the pole     

138
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,369
where the metal tenon will go. 

139
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,837
a tenon is the component    

140
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,974
that'll hold the light fixture to the pole.          

141
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,910
this particular model has an arched mounting arm.  

142
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,846
the composite has cooled a bit since curing,         

143
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,115
so they reheat it to make it flexible.      

144
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,318
after a bending machine makes the curve,        

145
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,755
they spray cold water inside to cool the material.     

146
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,058
this registers the curve in the resin's memory,     

147
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,760
setting the bent shape.    

148
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,072
now they cut out the hand hole,

149
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,073
the opening through which the electrician 

150
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,344
will connect the underground wire to the fixture wiring.   

151
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,348
workers then spray the pole with urethane paint.      

152
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,282
the paint acts like sunscreen, 

153
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,553
protecting the composite from damaging ultraviolet rays.

154
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,690
this grommet hole will connect to the underground pipe    

155
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,193
that contains the electrical wires.     

156
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,502
after installing a cover over the hand hole,      

157
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,639
it's time to assemble the parts --          

158
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,241
the underground pipe to the pole...         

159
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,815
...and the pole to the tenon and light fixture.       

160
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,997
narrator: many products have rounded components    

161
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,398
made of solid hardwood.    

162
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,868
often, the companies that make these products    

163
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,470
hire factories that specialize in wood-bending        

164
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,972
to prepare these components for them.           

165
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,675
bending wood may sound simple, but it isn't.         

166
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,144
it takes a lot of preparation and skill           

167
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,881
to bend wood without cracking it.      

168
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,687
the best type of wood to bend is hardwood.          

169
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,357
its fibers react better to heat and moisture      

170
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,760
than softwood fibers do and, therefore, curve nicely. 

171
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,163
if you bend softwood, it wrinkles.          

172
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,831
the wood first goes into an outdoor dryer     

173
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,436
to bring its humidity level down
to between 15% and 20%.    

174
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,972
this prevents the wood from expanding and contracting 

175
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,373
after it's bent.        

176
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,776
this air-drying process takes up to a week.      

177
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,978
once the wood is dry,     

178
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,849
a powerful trimmer saws the pieces to the required length, 

179
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,285
an edger to the required width.

180
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,332
now that the wood pieces are the right dimensions,   

181
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,934
they go into what's called a steaming box.        

182
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,270
this superficially rehumidifies them        

183
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,806
so that they become somewhat flexible.       

184
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,741
this takes from 10 to 45 minutes,     

185
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,344
depending on the type of wood and its thickness.       

186
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,080
this humidity will later evaporate out of the wood.   

187
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,285
now the pieces go into a press,
sandwiched between two forms  

188
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,354
in the shape of the curve to be made.          

189
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,757
the press applies both pressure
and heat --          

190
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,224
pressure to bend the wood,   

191
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,893
heat generated by a high-voltage electric current

192
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,163
to cure it, setting the new shape.     

193
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,033
how long the pieces stay in the press          

194
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,636
depends again on the species and dimensions.        

195
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,672
generally, it takes from 20 minutes to an hour.  

196
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,979
making this particular type of curve is called crown bending. 

197
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,048
workers measure each piece against the template      

198
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,385
to ensure the curve is just right.         

199
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,522
the factory uses the same process     

200
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,058
to bend these pieces into a different shape.    

201
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,660
it's critical to use      

202
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,128
just the right amount of heat and pressure --        

203
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,265
too high a temperature would burn the wood.      

204
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,700
too much force would crack it. 

205
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,605
these straight pieces of wood 

206
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,208
will become the rounded backs of windsor-style chairs,    

207
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,876
which is why this type of bending           

208
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,678
is called windsor bending.   

209
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,547
workers humidify the wood in the steaming box      

210
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:41,019
but will shape the pieces using a pressure-only process. 

211
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,497
they mount what's called a bending mold         

212
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,298
onto a hydraulic press.    

213
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
this machine uses just pressure

214
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,036
to bend the wood around the mold.        

215
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,539
no heat this time to immediately set the shape. 

216
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,178
instead, once the press curves the pieces,       

217
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,782
workers hook up a chain to temporarily hold the shape. 

218
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:36,007
then they transfer the bent  
pieces to a heated indoor dryer.

219
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,711
the drying process takes between two days and two weeks,

220
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,147
depending, as before, on the  
type of wood and the dimensions.

221
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,551
once the wood dries out, the curve is permanent.     

222
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,356
there are many wooden products that require bent components --

223
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,559
this wheel for a horse-drawn carriage, for example.     

224
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,562
back to the windsor chairs, now.

225
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,633
a dowel machine rounds off the bent pieces.        

226
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,935
before shipping the pieces out,

227
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,137
workers run them through a sander.       

228
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,941
this prepares them for the furniture factories,  

229
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,209
who will varnish or stain them.

230
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,215
upon receiving these chairbacks,       

231
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,618
the furniture factories will assembled them      

232
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,788
to the straight parts of the windsor chairs.     

233
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,636
narrator: the term "membrane switches" probably means nothing to you, 

234
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,240
but chances are you use them or
at least see them in use daily.

235
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,043
membrane switches       
are those soft touch-pad buttons

236
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,112
on the controls of many electrical       

237
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,247
and electronic devices --   

238
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,117
for example, the buttons on a microwave oven      

239
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,519
or on a cash register.     

240
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,725
the surface of the appliance's control panel         

241
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,460
is called the graphic overlay. 

242
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,795
it's a sheet of plastic    

243
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,965
on which they print the design of the control buttons.    

244
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,934
each button has        
a membrane switch underneath it.

245
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,603
to make this graphic overlay, 

246
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,272
they first laser-print a sheet of acetate film    

247
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,275
with the design -- as many copies as will fit.  

248
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,277
they lay the film on a polyester screen     

249
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,946
coated with a light-sensitive chemical.           

250
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,615
then, using this machine,   

251
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,352
they expose the screen to 2,000
watts of ultraviolet light   

252
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,020
for up to six minutes.     

253
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,890
the light hardens the chemical on the parts of the screen   

254
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,359
that aren't shielded by the design on the acetate. 

255
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,962
this blocks the screen's minute
holes everywhere        

256
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,964
except in the design.     

257
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,699
workers remove the acetate film

258
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,303
and rinse off the shielded chemical that didn't harden.  

259
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,039
now they have a screen stencil of the design         

260
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,541
they're going to print.    

261
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:31,716
workers dry off the screen and install it on a printing press.

262
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,918
a squeegee drags the ink across the screen,       

263
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,054
pushing it down through the open holes,    

264
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,158
printing the design onto the overlay plastic.   

265
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:52,003
ultraviolet lamps cure the ink in a matter of seconds.    

266
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,605
each color of the design goes on separately.      

267
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,275
that means that there isn't one printing screen      

268
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,077
for the entire graphic overlay,

269
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,113
but rather a separate screen for each color.        

270
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,223
meanwhile, on another screen printing press,        

271
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,359
they print the circuitry layout
onto transparent plastic.   

272
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,695
the ink contains silver, which conducts electricity.  

273
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,366
this circuitry layout will go behind the graphic overlay.  

274
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,470
again, they print several at a time.           

275
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,708
once the printing's done,   
it's time to assemble the layers

276
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,976
that make up the membrane switch.      

277
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,314
first, the circuit layer goes onto an adhesive sheet.    

278
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,383
a roller insures a solid, airtight bond.         

279
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,987
this spacer sheet will separate
the overlay and circuit layer 

280
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,723
to prevent contact between the two from being continuous. 

281
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,259
over each circuit goes a dome 

282
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,127
made of nickel-plated stainless steel.        

283
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,330
this forms an electrical contact
over the circuit        

284
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:57,268
that must be forcibly pressed in
order to activate the circuit. 

285
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,138
they adhere a polyester sheet to
hold the domes in place for now.

286
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,076
after cutting out each circuitry
layout and each graphic overlay,

287
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,078
they expose the adhesive backing
on the overlay         

288
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,615
and stick it to the circuit layer.     

289
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,152
the membrane switches are now complete.       

290
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,691
this control panel is for a hospital bed.     

291
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,632
some membrane switches have a 
light-emitting diode, or l.e.d.,

292
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,967
a tiny colored light that goes on          

293
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,937
when you press the switch to confirm contact.      

294
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:37,375
the factory's robotic machines 
deposit two drops of epoxy paste

295
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,244
on the circuit layer wherever an l.e.d. will go.  

296
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:44,048
the paste contains silver -- again, to conduct the current. 

297
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,651
a robot then picks up the l.e.d.s          

298
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,987
and deposits them on the drops of paste.     

299
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,195
the robot then puts a dome on each circuit,        

300
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,330
creating an electrical contact.

301
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,900
the red light you see is a   
camera checking the positioning.

302
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,404
testing equipment runs a current
through the circuitry     

303
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,007
to make sure that everything works.     

304
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,944
then a drop of transparent sealant goes over each l.e.d. 

305
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,480
the sealant hardens under ultraviolet light,    

306
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,483
holding everything solidly in place.           

307
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,086
now workers remove the panel from the automated line    

308
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,353
and plug it in.        

309
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,356
lighting up all the l.e.d.s  

310
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,992
helps them position the graphic overlay properly. 

311
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,030
this control panel is for a wall oven.      

312
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,099
no l.e.d.s on this model.   

313
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,835
and instead of a dome behind each button,      

314
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,770
they print an electrical contact

315
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,906
using the same conductive silver ink           

316
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,408
they use to print all the circuitry.       

317
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,714
after rolling on the graphic overlay,      

318
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,984
they peel off the protective plastic,    

319
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,386
then flip the control panel upside down          

320
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:57,922
and snap it into its cover.  

321
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,991
