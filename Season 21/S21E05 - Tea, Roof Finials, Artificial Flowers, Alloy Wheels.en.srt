   discovery communications     

3
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,918
    narrator: after water,      

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,720
    tea is the most consumed    
    beverage in the world.      

5
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,455
      the different types       
       are determined by        

6
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,790
      the degree to which       
         the producer           

7
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,992
   lets the harvested leaves    
            oxidize             

8
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,860
      before drying them.       

9
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,930
    green tea, for example,     
     is barely fermented,       

10
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,600
       whereas black tea        
     is greatly fermented.      

11
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,236
          oolong falls          
     somewhere in between.      

12
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,607
          in chinese,           

13
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,876
 oolong means "black dragon."   

14
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,277
   it's a semi-oxidized tea     

15
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,946
fermented more than green tea,  

16
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,215
   yet less than black tea.     

17
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,351
 its taste, aroma, and color,   

18
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,486
from light yellow to dark red,  

19
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:31,090
     vary according to how      
 the tea leaves are processed.  

20
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,426
       this amber oolong        
     produced in thailand       

21
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,429
       has a rich, smooth       
        roasted taste.          

22
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,166
        like most teas,         
      oolong is made from       

23
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,302
         the leaves of          
   a flowering plant species    

24
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,705
   called camellia sinensis.    

25
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:48,106
     harvest time is during     
    the plant's peak growing    
            season,             

26
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,344
      which, in thailand,       
   is from may to november.     

27
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,249
        workers handpick        
  what's known as the flush,    

28
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,652
         a grouping of          
  two young leaves and a bud,   

29
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,988
          which grows           
   out the top of the plant.    

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,258
     at this time of year,      
the plant produces a new flush  

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,560
      every 7 to 15 days.       

32
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,333
   an experienced tea master    

33
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,736
            directs             
every phase of the processing,  

34
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:20,206
    the first step of which     
  is called solar withering.    

35
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:24,142
    workers bring the leaves    
 into a glass-roofed building,  

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,480
   then spread them out in the  
               sun              
     for 15 to 20 minutes.      

37
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:31,083
      this kick-starts the      
    oxidization fermentation    
            process             

38
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:34,353
   as the chlorophyll enzymes   
   inside the wilting leaves    

39
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,488
     start breaking down.       

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,961
 at the same time, the moisture 
  inside begins evaporating.    

41
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:44,296
            workers             
 keep moving the leaves around  

42
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,799
           to ensure            
   a thorough exposure to the   
              sun.              

43
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,106
 then they gather up the leaves 
        for step two --         

44
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,975
       indoor withering.        

45
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,511
 the leaves lie on bamboo trays 
    for six to eight hours,     

46
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,980
     where, gently stirred      
       every two hours,         

47
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,549
     they oxidize further.      

48
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,519
   step three -- disruption.    

49
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,389
       the leaves go into       
       a rotating drum.         

50
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,391
        as they tumble,         
     they bruise and tear.      

51
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,393
        this breaks down        
     the cell structures,       

52
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,530
        enabling oxygen         
   to penetrate deep inside,    

53
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,066
      greatly accelerating      
         fermentation.          

54
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,602
       this also releases       
       the leaf juices,         

55
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,272
      which help draw out       
     the taste of the tea.      

56
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,610
when the tea master determines  

57
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,479
           the leaves           
  have sufficiently oxidized,   

58
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,680
     they stop the oxidation    
            process             

59
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,284
     by tumbling the leaves     
     in a gas-heated dryer      

60
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:41,086
     for 10 to 15 minutes.      

61
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,089
     this fourth step of the    
             process            
      is called fixation        

62
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,760
      because it fixes the      
           oxidization          
     at the desired level,      

63
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,963
   which can be anywhere from   
          8% to 85%,            

64
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,900
        depending on the        
      variety of oolong in      
          production.           

65
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,702
   this is the most critical    
      part of the process       

66
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:02,575
    because it determines the   
              tea's             
   taste, aroma, and color.     

67
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,915
    the next step forms the     
 tea leaves into tiny pellets.  

68
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,852
    first, workers shake the    
             leaves             
          on a sieve            

69
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:15,454
         to filter out          
   the dust-like particles.     

70
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,993
    then they bag the leaves    
       in a cotton cloth        

71
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,596
         and place them         
 first in a kneading machine,   

72
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:28,266
         then afterward         
      in a rolling press.       

73
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,136
 kneading and rolling the bag   

74
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:33,939
    twists the leaves inside    
      into tiny pellets.        

75
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,607
  forming these pellet shapes   

76
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,877
          intensifies           
    the flavor of the tea,      

77
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,011
      and, when the tea is      
     steeped in hot water,      

78
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,847
 releases that flavor slowly.   

79
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,955
    they repeat the sieving,    
  kneading, and rolling cycle   

80
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,023
        up to 35 times          

81
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,628
      until the tea master      
 is satisfied with the result.  

82
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,702
       then and only then       
 does the final step begin --   

83
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,838
            firing.             

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,906
     they transfer the tea      
          to an oven,           

85
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,109
     in which it undergoes      
      three drying cycles       

86
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,911
       of 20 minutes each       
      at a temperature of       

87
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,881
         approximately          
    210 degrees fahrenheit.     

88
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,587
    this dries the damp tea,    
 reducing the moisture content  

89
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:24,856
     to the target level of     
         less than 5%.          

90
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:29,528
           the firing           
also brings out the fragrance.  

91
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,932
     the traditional way to     
    brew oolong is in a clay    
            teapot,             

92
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:35,734
          using about           
  2 teaspoons of tea per cup.   

93
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:40,472
  ideally, the water should be  
190 to 210 degrees fahrenheit.  

94
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:43,008
         steeping time          
   is from 3 to 10 minutes,     

95
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,846
    and you can brew the same   
             leaves             
       up to five times.        

96
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,229
  narrator: originally crafted  
   from stone by the greeks,    

97
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,365
   finials are still on top.    

98
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,967
 perched on peaks and gables,   

99
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,234
     these roof ornaments       

100
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,237
      are a crowning touch      
       to any structure.        

101
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,039
         they can make          
     even an ordinary home      

102
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,708
   look a little more grand,    

103
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,645
         and after all,         
     every home is someone's    
            castle.             

104
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,785
      on many structures,       
  finials still rule the roof   

105
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,188
        and give people         
     a reason to look up.       

106
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,524
      the design of these       
     roof ornaments usually     
            reflects            

107
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,661
   the style of the building    
    and the owner's taste.      

108
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,862
   they're often custom made    
        for the client          

109
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,832
  and entirely hand crafted.    

110
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,938
   to make a copper finial,     

111
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,008
       the artisan first        
  draws the design on paper.    

112
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,011
       like many finials,       
  this one will have a point,   

113
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,412
        a central orb,          

114
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,815
         and skirting.          

115
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,884
    once the design has been    
    approved by the client,     

116
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,288
 he draws larger versions of it 
      onto poster board.        

117
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,057
   they'll serve as templates   
     for the copper parts.      

118
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,195
  here, he draws the patterns   
for the elaborate scroll work.  

119
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,038
     to execute the design,     
       he gets creative.        

120
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,841
  he uses copper refrigerator   
tubing to make the scrollwork.  

121
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,377
         it's malleable         
   and can easily be shaped.    

122
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,981
   he positions a pipe cutter   
    device at the cut line.     

123
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,717
  the device grips the tubing,  
    but can still be turned     

124
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,153
    to cut the pipe cleanly     
   at the desired location.     

125
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,123
      he flattens one end       
      with a sledgehammer       

126
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,924
          so it can be          
     tucked into a groove       

127
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,128
   in this large pvc plumbing   
             pipe.              

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
     with the end secured,      
         he physically          

129
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:50,468
    bends the copper tubing     
       around this pipe         

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,505
           to give it           
    the desired curvature.      

131
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,015
   he compares the curvature    
    to that of the pattern      

132
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,350
    and makes adjustments.      

133
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,419
 he continues shaping the pipe, 
           now using            

134
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,889
  only the scrollwork pattern   
          as a guide.           

135
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,026
     he'll make several of      
 these copper scrollwork parts  

136
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,061
    for one roof ornament.      

137
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,231
     with an etching tool,      
         he now traces          

138
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,767
           the shape            
    of the skirting pattern     

139
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,770
  onto copper roof sheeting.    

140
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,508
    he cuts reference points    
         for the bends          

141
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,445
   and removes the pattern.     

142
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:38,050
 he then extends the bend lines 
    with the etching tool.      

143
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,253
        he now cuts out         
       the skirting part        

144
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,655
   with standard hand shears    

145
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,758
 following the etched outline.  

146
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,396
 one last trim along the edge,  

147
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:55,034
 and the skirting is ready for  
     the sheet metal bending    
            machine.            

148
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,603
    he clamps it into place     

149
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,340
       and pulls a handle       
  to apply hydraulic pressure   

150
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:05,144
       and bend the part        
    along the etched lines.     

151
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,682
  he repositions the skirting   
         and bends it           

152
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,318
          at the next           
     etched marking point.      

153
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,556
 he continues until there are   

154
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,026
    six evenly spaced folds     
        in the copper.          

155
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,498
    this transforms it into     
     a hexagonal pyramid.       

156
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,102
    to seal it where the ends   
              meet,             
   he prepares the surface.     

157
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,073
 he applies an acid called flux 
     to clean the copper.       

158
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:41,046
      he ignites the torch      
    and melts solder into the   
             seam.              

159
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,250
           the solder           
   is half-lead and half-tin    

160
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,853
   and provides a good seal.    

161
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,460
   he sands the soldered seam   
 against a fine, abrasive belt  

162
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,797
 to blend it with the copper.   

163
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,734
      the finial skirting       
       is now complete.         

164
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:06,672
      he now drills holes       
   into a hollow copper orb.    

165
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,942
     he slides the orb onto     
      a long copper spike       

166
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,211
     that's been installed      
         in the base.           

167
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,747
      he cleans the copper      
   where the two parts meet     

168
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,217
  and solders them together.    

169
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,225
 he adds a second smaller orb   

170
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,162
       and the extravagant      
          scrollwork.           

171
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,699
 he now solders the spiked cap  
        to the finial.          

172
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:39,304
   this adds height and drama   
   to the rooftop ornament.     

173
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,714
  this finial is now complete   
  and ready for high places.    

174
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:53,018
   making one has truly been    
    a pinnacle achievement.     

175
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,339
  narrator: artificial flowers  
 have been used as decorations  

176
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,807
    for hundreds of years.      

177
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,610
           initially,           
  silk flowers made in china    

178
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,480
    were displayed in homes     
  and not commercially sold.    

179
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:23,648
     as far back as the 12th    
            century,            

180
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,885
  italian flower makers using   
 dye-colored silkworm cocoons   

181
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,356
     were the first to sell     
  their floral arrangements.    

182
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,560
      modern imitations of      
   natural flowering plants     

183
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:37,696
    are endless in variety,     
      stunning in color,        

184
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,698
  with realism so impressive,   

185
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,301
  they can look and feel like   
        the real thing.         

186
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,838
    since the '70s, most are    
  made of polyester fabrics.    

187
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,907
            a worker            
  places an iron cutter blade   

188
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,242
 on top of non-woven polyester  

189
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,179
 and then applies several tons  
     of hydraulic pressure      

190
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,513
     to complete the cuts.      

191
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:59,050
         the result is          
  20 layers of flower petals.   

192
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,919
        the worker wraps        
      piles of 100 petals       

193
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,323
        in elastic bands        
     and sets them aside.       

194
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:09,527
  another worker places petals  
      into a heated mold        

195
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,331
  to give the fabric texture.   

196
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,999
       using a glue gun,        

197
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,935
       a worker completes       
 the flower's petal structure   

198
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,670
         by assembling          
     two different shapes       

199
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,440
of non-woven polyester petals.  

200
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,012
   this is part of the flower   
             head.              

201
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,613
  in the coloring department,   

202
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,349
      a worker paints the       
 pieces of non-woven polyester  

203
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,218
       using watercolor.        

204
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,287
           she paints           
 the edges of the flower heads  

205
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,624
 in bundles of 100 at a time.   

206
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:41,159
    the painted flower heads    
      go into a microwave       

207
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,362
   for two to five minutes.     

208
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,899
     the dried flower heads     
  now undergo silk screening    

209
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:52,570
         one at a time          
     using acrylic paint.       

210
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,972
  customers can choose among    

211
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:57,175
     more than 50 different     
        color patterns.         

212
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,847
        the flower heads        
       have been pressed        

213
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:05,117
 to simulate natural curving.   

214
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,118
       using a glue gun,        

215
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,252
            a worker            
   connects the flower head     

216
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,658
        to the petals of        
   this phalaenopsis orchid.    

217
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,991
    the goal is not only to     

218
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,328
        make the flowers        
   look as real as possible.    

219
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,464
     it's also to make them     
   feel as real as possible,    

220
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,601
       which takes us to        
        the next stage.         

221
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:26,071
          an employee           
 puts two flowers together...   

222
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,676
       ...lines them up,        
      then adds a stick,        

223
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,880
       which will be held       
     in the next part of the    
            process.            

224
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,553
   she encircles them tightly   
     with an elastic band.      

225
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,756
         another worker         
     dips the two flowers in    
            polymer,            

226
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,759
     which helps make them      
    feel real to the touch.     

227
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,494
    she spins the flowers to    
             remove             

228
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,164
     as much excess polymer     
         as possible.           

229
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,735
       workers then brush       
     excess polymer from the    
            petals.             

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,642
            a worker            
   attaches flower buds to the  
              stem              

231
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,044
   using green floral tape.     

232
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,513
          she attaches          
  the petals and flower head    

233
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,450
 and continues to wrap the stem 
        in floral tape          

234
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,486
    until the entire length     
          is covered.           

235
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,392
       to make the leaves       
    feel real to the touch,     

236
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,394
 a worker dips them in polymer  

237
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,064
    and wipes off any excess    
       with her fingers.        

238
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,740
   after one hour of drying,    
          the worker            

239
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,075
      dips the same leaves      
       in green polymer.        

240
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,679
 again, she removes any excess  

241
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:46,083
   and sets the leaves aside    
  for another hour of drying.   

242
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,153
    once they're dry, another   
             worker             
       gives the leaves         

243
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,022
a final coat of polymer paint.  

244
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,426
     she removes the excess     
   and sets the leaves aside    

245
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,762
     for yet another hour of    
            drying.             

246
00:14:56,764 --> 00:15:00,399
     all the drying is done     
     at room temperature.       

247
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,703
        now coated with         
  several layers of polymer,    

248
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,038
    the leaves stick to each    
             other.             

249
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,176
 to fix that, a worker applies  

250
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:15,046
    a thin coating of talcum    
             powder             
        with a sponge.          

251
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,521
       the coating solves       
 the problem of sticky leaves.  

252
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,191
    with its many components    
       fully assembled,         

253
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,394
    this finished flower is     
 a rather dazzling recreation   

254
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,797
   of the cymbidium orchid.     

255
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:38,737
     shipping these flowers     
  requires careful packaging.   

256
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:42,641
    they wrap the glass vase    
      in clear plastic...       

257
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,616
    ...and place it securely    
  inside a polystyrene base.    

258
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,820
     the flower is lowered      
   into the box upside down.    

259
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,956
    the base is snug enough     
    to keep the flower from     

260
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,624
    moving inside the box,      

261
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,828
     which the worker then      
   seals shut for shipping.     

262
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,830
authentic looking and feeling,  

263
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,701
   these striking flowers are   
     sure to make any decor     
            blossom.            

264
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:25,116
           narrator:            
   higher-end cars typically co 

265
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,586
 rather than basic steel wheels 
    covered with a hubcap.      

266
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,322
   called mag wheels, because   
   when they first came out,    

267
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,725
       they were made of        
    an alloy of magnesium.      

268
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,661
  today's alloy wheels are made 
               of               
      an aluminum alloy,        

269
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,297
  which is far more durable.    

270
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,134
     aluminum alloy wheels      
         are not only           

271
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,403
      more attractive than      
       standard wheels.         

272
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,672
          they're also          
   a fraction of the weight,    

273
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,741
         and therefore          
require less energy to rotate.  

274
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,678
      this contributes to       
    greater fuel efficiency     

275
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,282
  as well as better handling,   
  acceleration, and braking.    

276
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:01,018
 manufacturing them begins with 
   high-grade aluminum alloy    

277
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,955
   containing 97% aluminum.     

278
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:08,426
 a furnace heats the ingots to  
over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit.  

279
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,562
          they liquify          
     in about 25 minutes.       

280
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,899
      the molten aluminum       
then flows directly to a mixer  

281
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,035
   in which they inject argon   
              gas,              

282
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,237
     which enables them to      
     remove the hydrogen.       

283
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,106
  this increases the density,   

284
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,176
      making the aluminum       
 less porous when solidified.   

285
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,046
          after adding          
 powdered titanium, magnesium,  

286
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,516
 and other metallic elements to 
     further strengthen the     
           aluminum,            

287
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,052
      they blend in flux,       
       a chemical which         

288
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,155
      draws aluminum oxide      
        to the surface.         

289
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,528
  they skim off this impurity   
     along with the flux,       

290
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,099
    and the liquid aluminum     
     is ready for casting.      

291
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,002
   the wheel mold is made of    
     high-strength steel.       

292
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,004
         it's actually          
    a set of three molds --     

293
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,875
  the upper mold, which forms   
 the inside face of the wheel,  

294
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:00,545
     the 4-part side mold,      
 which forms the wheel's edge,  

295
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,748
      and the lower mold,       
  which forms the outer face.   

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,150
    that's the side with the    
            design,             

297
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,820
           so this is           
   the most intricate mold.     

298
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:15,026
  it takes three to four weeks  
      to produce a mold.        

299
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,427
  computer simulations check    

300
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,097
    the flow and temperature    
    of the liquid aluminum,     

301
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,900
      factors critical for      
  preventing casting defects.   

302
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,769
      the casting machine       
        is designed to          

303
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,306
 fill the mold from the bottom  
   by pressurized injection.    

304
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,441
        injecting upward        
      through the bottom,       

305
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,044
  rather than pouring downward  
         into the top,          

306
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,912
     reduces the risk of air    
            bubbles,            

307
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,382
     which cause defects.       

308
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,651
     right before casting,      
       the molten metal         

309
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,252
  flows through a filter sheet  
            made of             

310
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,855
   high-temperature-resistant   
           ceramic.             

311
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,992
           this traps           
  additional aluminum oxide.    

312
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:48,860
 once cast, the aluminum takes  

313
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,663
     about 7 to 10 minutes      
         to solidify.           

314
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,998
         then the mold          
     automatically opens,       

315
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,268
    releasing the newly cast    
             wheel.             

316
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,804
            workers             
 submerge it in lukewarm water  

317
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,340
      for a few minutes.        

318
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,276
   this cools it down enough    
        to be handled.          

319
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,219
      the wheel undergoes       
    a complex heat treatment    
            process             

320
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,823
      that takes 12 hours       
     from start to finish.      

321
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,827
   first, they heat the wheel   
  to 900 degrees fahrenheit.    

322
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,363
        this rearranges         
   the molecular structure,     

323
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,965
   strengthening the metal.     

324
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,835
      next, what's known as     
           quenching.           

325
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,572
   they submerge the wheel in   
     80-degree water for 30     
            seconds.            

326
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,375
     this locks in that new     
           strength.            

327
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,310
  then they reheat the wheel,   

328
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,247
           this time            
 to 180 degrees for nine hours  

329
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,517
    to further stabilize the    
             metal.             

330
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,652
 the wheel doesn't come out of  
the mold in perfect condition.  

331
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,388
  the edges are rough, due to   

332
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,791
       some excess metal        
  that has to be trimmed off.   

333
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:56,127
    so they mount the wheel     
  on a computer-guided lathe.   

334
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,662
    it precision-machines the   
             sides,             

335
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,000
        refining them to        
    within 0.05 millimeters     

336
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:06,270
 of the measurements specified  
  in the technical drawings.    

337
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,672
   as for the more intricate    
      base of the wheel,        

338
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,177
       a worker manually        
 trims the edges with a blade.  

339
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:21,953
    the shape now finalized,    
  it's time to test the wheel   

340
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,290
  to make sure it's airtight.   

341
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,091
       while pumping air        
        into the wheel,         

342
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,826
  they submerge it in water.    

343
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,361
should any air bubbles appear,  

344
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,630
         it would mean          
there's a pinhole in the metal  

345
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,232
      or some shrinkage,        

346
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,834
         in which case,         
      the wheel would fail      
          inspection.           

347
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,369
        no air bubbles.         

348
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,372
     the wheel proceeds to      
 the automated painting line.   

349
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,108
      first, a base coat,       
     then a coat of color,      

350
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,911
   which can be anything from   
    classic silver or black     

351
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,712
     to a flashier shade.       

352
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:53,318
  then a clear coat to protect  
      the paint and prevent     
           corrosion.           

353
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,853
from every 1,500 or so wheels,  

354
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,322
          the factory           
 randomly selects two or three  

355
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,459
          to test for           
     performance and wear.      

356
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,327
        workers install         
      the decorative cap        

357
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,196
  that covers the center hub.   

358
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,666
     it typically bears the     
            specific            
         brand's logo.          

359
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:11,069
          then a final          
      cosmetic inspection       

360
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,471
          to make sure          
  these aluminum alloy wheels   

361
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,441
 look as good as they perform.  

362
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,020
