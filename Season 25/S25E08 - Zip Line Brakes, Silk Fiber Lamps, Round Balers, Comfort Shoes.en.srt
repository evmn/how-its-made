captions paid for by discovery communications     

3
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,719
narrator: many thrill-seekers find zip lines exhilarating.   

4
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,988
but without the proper braking system,    

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,524
they can quickly become terrifying.        

6
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,328
magnetic brakes are hands-free and engage automatically.    

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,996
so there's no need to panic.   

8
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,399
just hang on, enjoy the ride,  

9
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,101
and let the brake take care of the landing.    

10
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:14,073
in early human history, zip lines were used       

11
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:17,276
to transfer supplies across dangerous terrain.    

12
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,812
today, zip lines are popular with tourists    

13
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:23,349
and adrenaline junkies all over the world.       

14
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:27,152
as the rider approaches     
the landing, the brake engages  

15
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:31,023
using magnets that induce eddy currents instead of friction.  

16
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,060
this creates enough drag to stop the ride.        

17
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,299
to make a zip line brake, they start with a drum.     

18
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:44,102
it's made of zinc-coated steel to prevent rust.         

19
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,740
a worker sends off the zinc so they can add the magnets.   

20
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,980
he hammers locating pins into the metal.         

21
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:56,582
he applies adhesive to the sanded areas,       

22
00:01:56,584 --> 00:02:00,786
then places magnets onto the adhesive.        

23
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,456
he uses steel pins as a guide.  

24
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,227
as the adhesive cures,     
the magnets bond to the metal.  

25
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,933
next, he applies a bonding agent to a shaft bearing        

26
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:17,136
and inserts it into the hole in the center.   

27
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,737
using a hydraulic press,     

28
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,440
he drives the bearing further into the hole.      

29
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,812
these rotor arms will spin in the magnetic field              

30
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,881
to create the braking force.   

31
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,618
a worker fits gears into two plates         

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,289
and bolts the plates to each side of the rotor assembly.            

33
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,159
he tests the rotor arms and slides the rotor gears    

34
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,095
onto the shaft already installed in the brake drum.        

35
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,166
he opens the rotors and spins them.         

36
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,501
he adds a ring of magnets    

37
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:53,505
to surround the rotors in a magnetic field.       

38
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,241
satisfied with the fit,     

39
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,778
he removes the rotor assembly from the drum temporarily    

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,646
and clips springs to the rotor.             

41
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,984
these reaction springs will cushion the braking action.             

42
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:10,856
now a worker reinstalls the rotor device in the brake drum.              

43
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,993
he places the magnetic ring back on top.           

44
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:17,296
the strong magnetic attraction secures it to the assembly.   

45
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:24,670
the next part is a large ring with more gears inside it.    

46
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,239
he hammers and then screws it in place.   

47
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,579
he spins the assembly again to confirm it's functional.   

48
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:40,752
he installs the final two gears on the end of the shaft.     

49
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,690
this completes the core of the zip line brake.      

50
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,693
another employee stitches a nylon hand grip    

51
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,829
to tough, synthetic webbing.   

52
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:53,165
when this webbing is pulled out of the brake,   

53
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,034
it will set the rotor arms in motion     

54
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,937
to create the eddy currents that are the braking force.   

55
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,842
after protecting the brake core with a metal plate,       

56
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:07,112
a worker puts the unit in a plastic case.        

57
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,449
he installs a plate on the shaft for the webbing to sit on,    

58
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,584
then loops the webbing around it.            

59
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,455
he also places a drum on top for the retraction spring.    

60
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,457
he applies silicone adhesive around the drum.         

61
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,194
this secures the aluminum base plate.     

62
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,197
he now inserts the retraction spring.      

63
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
he caps the spring with a metal plate        

64
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,869
and reinforces the clips with metallic tape.       

65
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:35,607
using a crank, he winds more  
of the webbing into the brake.  

66
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,476
he tightens the metal shackle  

67
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,479
that holds the two sections of webbing together       

68
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,082
and winds the rest of it into the device.         

69
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,087
he inserts a guide roller for the webbing         

70
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,322
and adds a two-part retaining clip.         

71
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,730
he secures the clip with a rounded metal pin.    

72
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:04,770
this next part is a plastic insert for the top of the case.              

73
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:09,041
he screws a nut onto the shaft to lock down the insert.     

74
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:12,178
he places the top half of the case onto the brake assembly            

75
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,048
and secures it to the lower half.        

76
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,985
he snaps a dust cover onto the case.          

77
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,856
they're now ready to test this zip line brake system.   

78
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,791
a motor pulls out the webbing  

79
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,593
to simulate different body weights           

80
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,728
and different zip lining speeds,             

81
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,800
while a computer analyzes the brake's performance.     

82
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,868
with magnetic zip line brakes,  

83
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,738
riders can come down at a wide range of speeds    

84
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,340
but still slow down at the same rate,        

85
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,178
ensuring that everyone has a fun but safe ride.     

86
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,562
narrator: silk fibres can be creatively crafted    

87
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,898
into a variety of artistic objects,       

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,436
from paper to fabric or even items like lamps.    

89
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,103
the fibres are translucent,   

90
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,039
so they can take bright, white light       

91
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,842
and diffuse it into warm, beautiful mood lighting.     

92
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,383
this lamp doesn't have shades.  

93
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,386
instead, it has natural-looking silk flowers   

94
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,321
which conceal its lights.    

95
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,891
the lamp base is made of branches.       

96
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,061
to create this functional artwork,     

97
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,063
the artisan begins with a roving.          

98
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,932
a roving is a bundle of fibres  

99
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:43,468
harvested from a silk moth caterpillar's cocoon.      

100
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,004
they've been cleaned and straightened.        

101
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,940
she places the roving in a nylon mesh bag,       

102
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,945
then submerges it        
in a specially formulated dye.  

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,152
she heats the dye to 185 degrees,         

104
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,221
then sprinkles in more powdered dye        

105
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,924
to produces splashes of bolder colors.        

106
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,130
after a couple of minutes, she removes the roving...    

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,935
...and rinses off the excess dye.         

108
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:23,509
she hangs the roving on a rack until it's completely dry.    

109
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:30,249
roving is typically spun into thread to make silk fabric,   

110
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,651
but this artisan has a different technique.    

111
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:38,057
she spreads a sheet of tulle on her work table.        

112
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,926
then she gently separates the fine, hair-like fibres    

113
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,063
and lays them out on the tulle.             

114
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,673
each pile will be turned into a flower for the lamp.      

115
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,209
she folds over the tulle to create a barrier       

116
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:01,747
that keeps the fibers from sticking to her hands.   

117
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,482
she prepares the fibres     

118
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,951
for the textile medium she'll apply next,        

119
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,820
a polymer adhesive.       

120
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,755
she saturates each pile     

121
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,425
with water containing a few   
drops of dishwashing detergent  

122
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,360
to open up the fibres.      

123
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,030
then she sponges up the excess water         

124
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:21,233
and soaks up any other remaining moisture with a towel              

125
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,436
so the medium does not become diluted.     

126
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:28,707
now she's ready         
to apply the polymer adhesive.  

127
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,110
as the fibres absorb the medium, they fuse together,       

128
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,147
forming a sheet of silk fibre paper.       

129
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,921
after folding back the tulle,  

130
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,091
she begins molding each paper into a flower.          

131
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,065
she spreads the paper over a balloon          

132
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,267
and lets it dry overnight.    

133
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,673
with a few simple steps,     

134
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,275
she has transformed a colorless roving        

135
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,613
into colorful sheets of moldable silk fibre paper.  

136
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,916
the next day, she pops the balloon.      

137
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,055
the silk fibre paper holds its round shape.      

138
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,831
using the textile medium again,             

139
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:31,036
she glues her silk fibre flowers to juniper branches.       

140
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,311
she secures them with a needle and thread,    

141
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,446
matching the thread color to the silk           

142
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,881
so that it blends in.      

143
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,453
she further sculpts the flowers             

144
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,924
with a stitch or two in select spots.         

145
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:56,528
and dabs textile medium on the thread to secure it.   

146
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,464
then she glues in a second, slightly smaller flower,     

147
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,667
creating two layers of petals.  

148
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,138
she takes some fibres she dyed green          

149
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,542
and glues them under the blooms to form wispy leaves.      

150
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:21,019
finally, to turn this sculpture into a functioning lamp,     

151
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,956
she places a battery powered l.e.d. push light        

152
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,125
in the center of each flower.  

153
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,841
the lamp needs no inner wiring  

154
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,378
and doesn't need to be plugged into an outlet.  

155
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,513
you simply press the middle of each flower    

156
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,650
to turn its hidden push light on or off.            

157
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,687
a simple sculpture by day, and a gentle light by night.   

158
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,676
narrator: round hay balers automatically 

159
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:22,080
they can also wrap the rolled hay in twine or plastic.     

160
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,349
this american invention allows farmers          

161
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,554
to put down their pitchforks and leave the work to the machines.            

162
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,162
the invention of the round baler was a farming breakthrough.   

163
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,533
round bales of hay       
stayed drier than square ones.  

164
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,771
making a round hay baler     

165
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,108
starts with a computerized fiber-optic laser.        

166
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,845
it cuts steel sheaths into the shape of the side panels   

167
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:58,049
and makes holes for hardware and machine components.     

168
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,918
once the cuts have been made,  

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,721
workers remove the leftover materials.     

170
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,657
they'll be recycled into new steel sheets.      

171
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:07,526
next, the baler side panel    

172
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:10,395
goes to a computerized hydraulic folder.        

173
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,068
it bends the edges of the panel to prepare it for assembly.   

174
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:21,406
with the side panel clamped in a fixture,      

175
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:26,411
a worker slides bolts into a part called the doubler plate.             

176
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,616
this plate will be used to reinforce the panel.     

177
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:34,619
he welds the heads of the bolts to the doubler plate.      

178
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,021
the bolts protrude up      

179
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,924
so bearings and other parts can be attached later.      

180
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,098
he adds other reinforcing parts,             

181
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,601
supports for rollers, and a box for twine.       

182
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,772
then it's over to the paint department.     

183
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,375
they prime and paint both sides of the panel     

184
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,976
with an epoxy finish       

185
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,612
in order to protect the steel from corrosion.         

186
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,385
after the paint dries, cranes lift two panels      

187
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:11,256
over to a fixture that holds several baler rollers.      

188
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,324
workers insert the ends of the rollers     

189
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:16,328
into holes in the side panels.  

190
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,263
they add an auger for moving the hay        

191
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,332
away from the sides of the baler.          

192
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:25,336
they secure all of these components with bolts.      

193
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,272
next, they install a belt-tightening assembly.   

194
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,275
the bars will hold the hay-shaping belts      

195
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,643
at the correct tension.     

196
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,082
after adding a bearing to the bottom feed roller,    

197
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,151
a worker installs sprockets.   

198
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:42,554
he also loops chains around them.           

199
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,289
the sprockets and chains     

200
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,360
will drive the 14 rollers in the baler.          

201
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,163
the next part is known as the hay pickup,   

202
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,497
because its steel teeth     

203
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,501
lift hay from the field and into the baler.       

204
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,838
it fits on the front of the machine.         

205
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,306
now a worker installs the wheels.       

206
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,643
he brushes a lubricant onto spindles          

207
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,712
and inserts them in the wheel axles.       

208
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:11,983
bolts secure the spindles to the axles.          

209
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,452
then he mounts the wheels to the spindles         

210
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,822
and locks them in place with nuts.            

211
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,462
once the two wheels are installed,          

212
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:26,531
a crane lifts the machine into an upright position     

213
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,368
in order to install the rear chamber.        

214
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:39,010
a crane lowers the rear chamber onto the baler assembly.     

215
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,213
as the hay is shaped with a round bale by the machine,   

216
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,218
it will gradually expand in this chamber.         

217
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,055
these rubber belts will roll the hay into round bales.    

218
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,627
the team loops them around tensioning rollers,    

219
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,763
arranging them closely together.            

220
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,904
a worker joins the ends of each belt      

221
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,874
by pushing steel pins through riveted lacing.     

222
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:19,351
an employee applies vinyl decals to the outside of the baler.   

223
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,858
the decals display the company name         

224
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,528
and the machine model in bold graphics.        

225
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,266
the machine is equipped with hydraulic cylinders     

226
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,538
so the rear chamber can be raised and lowered.    

227
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,174
a technician syncs the tractor cab monitor  

228
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:46,611
to sensors added to the baler during the assembly.       

229
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,148
the sensors indicate      
the position of the back gate,  

230
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,416
the status of the bale wrapping equipment,           

231
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,486
and the moisture level in the hay.           

232
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,890
after a complete operational check,              

233
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,627
this baler is ready to give farmers or ranchers a break   

234
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,131
by automatically creating round bales of hay.       

235
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,982
narrator: with footwear,     

236
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,652
extremely comfortable used to mean extremely ugly.   

237
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,387
not anymore.           

238
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,258
today's comfort shoes don't look anything like they used to.   

239
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,127
they can be just as stylish as any other shoe,        

240
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,364
but also provide sturdy, cushioning foot support.     

241
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,872
these comfort shoes come with two interchangeable insoles.   

242
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:52,010
one is an anatomically shaped footbed with good arch support.            

243
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,279
the other is a reflexology footbed     

244
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,615
that massages your feet while you walk.         

245
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,686
the top of the shoe is made of leather.       

246
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,689
an operator spreads the cowhide on a cutting table        

247
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,226
and positions a part-shaped steel die over it.               

248
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,696
with a press, he forces the die through the leather.       

249
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,965
the die has blades on both sides,          

250
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,500
so after cutting a part for the right shoe,    

251
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,438
he flips it over and cuts the same part for the left shoe.              

252
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,707
they stencil on guide marks for stitching    

253
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,309
and stamp on a production number.       

254
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,513
due to the natural variations between hides,          

255
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,315
they cut parts for a pair of shoes       

256
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,784
from the same piece of leather.            

257
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,719
a production number keeps the parts         

258
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,190
from being inadvertently used on a different pair of shoes.  

259
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,526
they place the part under a template         

260
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,728
and run it through a lateral knife.         

261
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,999
this thins the leather where it will overlap adjoining parts              

262
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:52,003
so the thickness of the upper shoe is uniform throughout.   

263
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,205
they apply reinforcement fabric             

264
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,141
to the most wear-prone areas of the shoe.           

265
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,544
this machine bonds these adhesive factory enforcements  

266
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,814
with pressure and heat.     

267
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,283
now sewers begin assembling the upper.      

268
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,552
they glue the parts for the lining together     

269
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:10,154
because stitches that are on the inside of the shoe    

270
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,690
can sometimes irritate the foot.              

271
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,426
the lining is made of soft calf leather,      

272
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,696
except for a small piece of rougher goat leather at the back              

273
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,065
to grip the heel.        

274
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,638
they sew in the lining one section at a time.      

275
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,442
this is the rear section of the upper, called the heel cap.              

276
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,244
after sewing one side,      

277
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,981
they insert a foam padding to cushion the back of the foot.              

278
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,585
then they fold the lining over to encase the padding.      

279
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,160
this machine punches holes and 
embeds eyelets into the upper.  

280
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,668
then a sewer attaches two more parts of the upper,   

281
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,470
the tongue and the vamp.     

282
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,177
another sewer finishes the upper             
by stitching on the vamp ring.  

283
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,619
they put the upper into a mold on a forming machine.      

284
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,356
the machine works like an iron, applying both heat and pressure            

285
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,726
to form the heel cap into the perfect shape.     

286
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,764
the next forming machine uses the same process      

287
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,833
to round the toe cap.      

288
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,279
now a sewer stitches a hole to the upper.          

289
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,720
then they steam the upper and insert a last.        

290
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,256
a last is a foot-shaped plastic form           

291
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,926
that matches the specific shape and size of the shoe.      

292
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,996
they place the upper into a heat setter.       

293
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,465
the heat forms the upper to the shape of the last.    

294
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,934
they roll out wrinkles      

295
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,837
and flatten any bulges with heat and pressure.     

296
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,407
they place the upper       

297
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,543
in a template of the shoe's outer sole     

298
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,211
and trace the top.        

299
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,747
they grind the leather below that line.         

300
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:19,217
this roughens the surface to help with adhesion.      

301
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,085
they apply heat-activated glue  

302
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,220
to the roughened area and the sole,          

303
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,024
which is made of molded polyurethane.     

304
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,026
they let the glue dry.      

305
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,229
then they activate the glue with a heater          

306
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,265
and join the upper and sole.   

307
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,034
they place the shoe in a vacuum press.        

308
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,837
the press sucks out the air   

309
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,507
while drawing the upper and sole tightly together.        

310
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,711
next, they add an anatomically shaped footbed insole.      

311
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,180
it's made of a moisture absorbing combination      

312
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:53,584
of cork and latex with leather on top.       

313
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,187
then they lace the shoes     

314
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,125
and insert cardboard to support the shape during transport.   

315
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,728
they spray the upper with a chemical solution     

316
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,098
that makes the leather water-resistant.         

317
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:14,005
the second set of insoles goes in the shoe box.      

318
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,274
these shoes are designed with enough room         

319
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,177
to insert a custom orthotic device, if needed.   

320
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,822
