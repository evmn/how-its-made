         of the cylinder        

248
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,762
       to receive the cap       
         and connector.         

249
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,631
      a technician brushes      
     a pipe-compound sealant    

250
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,100
       on to the threads.       

251
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,170
       the sealant ensures      
        a watertight fit.       

252
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:10,041
    then he screws the cap to   
 the bottom end of the cylinder.

253
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:15,447
  he adds the top connector and 
 inserts both ends into a lathe.

254
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:19,050
   with the bottom held firmly  
  in place by the lathe chuck,  

255
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,319
       he places a wrench       
         on the top end         

256
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,722
      and lets the machine      
       tighten the parts.       

257
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,327
      next, the check valve     
      and the plunger valve     

258
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,998
 are inserted into the cylinder.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,133
   this clear acrylic version   
         of the cylinder        

260
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,336
          demonstrates          
     how the process works.     

261
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,806
      as the plunger valve      
       slides up and down,      

262
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:45,009
         the check valve        
       remains stationary.      

263
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,848
it's hard not to be pumped about
   an old technology so good.   

264
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:03,428
                     ♪          

265

 narrator: nonconductive digging
        and cutting tools       

266
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,966
      protect workers from      
    potential hazards such as   

267
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,968
    underground power lines.    

268
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,838
    when a nonconductive tool   
        hits a live wire,       

269
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
    the risk is neutralized.    

270
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,376
   the handle blocks the flow   
          of electrons          

271
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,647
      and reduces the risk      
      of unexpected shocks.     

272
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,982
     workers who need to dig    
          run the risk          

273
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,452
         of hitting live        
        electrical wires.       

274
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,988
    the nonconductive handles   
         of these tools         

275
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,056
         will counteract        
    the flow of electricity,    

276
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,259
  stopping danger in its path.  

277
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,729
      the handles are made      
         of fiberglass.         

278
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,265
  they are made using a process 
      known as pultrusion.      

279
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,068
   a machine pulls glass twine  

280
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,403
       through the stages       
         of production.         

281
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:49,674
each piece of twine is comprised
  of hundreds of glass strands. 

282
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,478
    the twine unwinds through   
      an orange resin bath,     

283
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,749
         which permeates        
        the glass fibers.       

284
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,351
        a die compresses        
     the resin-soaked glass     

285
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,887
 to a specific length and width.

286
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,425
  the result is slightly larger 
 than what is ultimately needed.

287
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,627
    the compressed fiberglass   
         travels through        

288
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:13,231
a microwave oven for preheating.

289
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,634
   then the fiberglass enters   
      a second heated die.      

290
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:21,106
 the process squeezes the handle
  to its final size, shapes it, 

291
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,108
     and cures the material.    

292
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,642
     as it's pulled forward,    

293
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,780
 the long fiberglass form cools 
         and solidifies.        

294
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:32,450
    this machine, called the    
 tractor, is doing the pulling. 

295
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:36,520
  the tractor's treaded rubber  
 pads grab the fiberglass shaft 

296
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,123
         and deliver it         
       to a circular saw.       

297
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,662
  the saw slices the fiberglass 
  shaft to a specified length.  

298
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:46,664
  since the fiberglass is only  
        partially cured,        

299
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:51,202
    the handles are cooled at   
 room temperature for 24 hours. 

300
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,805
     the handles vary based     
      on the type of tool.      

301
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,076
   a machinist cuts one end of  
     the handle on an angle     

302
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,911
     to fit the blade shank.    

303
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,483
       using a sharp disc,      

304
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:09,354
    he carves spiral grooves    
  at the base of the angle cut. 

305
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,023
       these grooves allow      
    the shovel shank to fuse    

306
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,758
   with the end of the handle.  

307
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,698
   next, the handle is placed   
 in an injection-molding machine

308
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,169
      with the grooved end      
     extended into the mold.    

309
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:27,105
 glass-filled nylon pellets move
      through the machine's     

310
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,375
    heated chamber and melt.    

311
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,911
an auger forces the thick liquid
         into the mold.         

312
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,381
  the shovel shank takes shape  
  around the end of the handle, 

313
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,586
  and glass-filled nylon liquid 
     flows into the grooves.    

314
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,356
   the shank becomes integral   
         to the handle.         

315
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,128
     next, a machinist clips    
       the excess material      

316
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,263
  from the newly formed shank.  

317
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,800
    the glass and nylon shank   
     is also nonconductive.     

318
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:00,739
   the shank end is submerged   
       in a cooling bath.       

319
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,608
  using a drill, the machinist  
     removes bolts from nuts    

320
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,445
     installed in the shank     
         during molding.        

321
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,347
  this leaves the nuts embedded 
          in the shank.         

322
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,118
    they'll be used to attach   
        the shovel blade.       

323
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,024
  meanwhile, another technician 
     applies a rubber gasket    

324
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,893
    to the end of the shank.    

325
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,363
      the gasket has holes      
    that keep the nuts open.    

326
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,099
   he places the shovel blade   
        on the assembly,        

327
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,568
       aligning the holes       
         with the nuts.         

328
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,205
   he secures the shovel blade  
    to the shank with screws.   

329
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:41,112
     it's nonconductive from    
 the handle to the metal blade, 

330
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:45,483
 so the user can safely grip it 
       at almost any spot.      

331
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,453
 apart from being nonconductive,

332
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,156
      this shovel must also     
         be heavy-duty.         

333
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,259
      to test its strength,     

334
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,263
      an inspector inserts      
    the blade into a machine.   

335
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,668
     once he has determined     
         the test area,         

336
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,137
     the chain is connected     
      to a container filled     

337
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,407
         with sand bags         
     that weigh 250 pounds.     

338
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,479
     he lowers the platform     
       that holds the load      

339
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,614
    and observes the handle.    

340
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:22,220
 if the handle bends but doesn't
break, it's sufficiently strong.

341
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,489
 the inspector places the shovel
        in another tester       

342
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,826
      and runs 10,000 volts     
 of electricity through the tool

343
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:33,098
     to measure the leakage     
    at the end of the handle.   

344
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,301
 if it's minimal, he assigns the
  shovel a unique serial number 

345
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,969
   and brands it as certified   

346
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,139
          according to          
      electrical standards.     

347
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:48,446
  on site, a nonconductive tool 
      can be indispensable,     

348
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,981
providing the user a safe handle

349
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,185
        on a potentially        
      dangerous situation.
