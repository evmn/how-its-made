00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,105
now a weigh-in to make sure it  

504
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,274
falls within regulation range --

505
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,779
between 53 and 56 ounces.       

506
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,580
in the final operation, a       

507
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,649
printing machine spins the pin  

508
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,417
under an inkpad to apply        

509
00:20:53,586 --> 00:21:01,058
decorative stripes.             

510
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,626
then, another pad prints the    

511
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,395
manufacturer's logo.            

512
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,897
the ink dries to the touch in   

513
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,400
just 5 minutes and fully cures  

514
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,871
in 24 hours.                    

515
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,140
crafted from wood slabs in about

516
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,174
40 minutes, plus ink-curing     

517
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,176
time, these bowling pins are    

518
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:24,682
alley-ready.
