00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:57,456
            narrator:           
 the bamboo bicycle was invented
 in england in the 19th century,

2
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:01,193
       and the idea never       
 really went anywhere until now.

3
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,795
    the modern bamboo bicycle   

4
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,331
     is a highly engineered     
        piece of work --        

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,400
   one that takes advantage of  
   bamboo's steely sturdiness   

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,537
         and its ability        
      to absorb vibrations.     

7
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,944
     at a time when bicycles    
         are often made         

8
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:21,213
    of high-tech carbon fiber   
       and exotic alloys,       

9
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,083
  the bamboo bike takes things  
    in a whole new direction.   

10
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:27,820
     bamboo cane is a grass     
    that's incredibly sturdy.   

11
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,554
 and because it's fast-growing, 

12
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,326
     a bicycle made from it     
     is as green as it gets.    

13
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:39,564
  the frame builder starts with 
the strongest species of bamboo.

14
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,500
            each cane           
    is scrutinized to confirm   

15
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:45,504
  that it's perfectly straight  
     and structurally sound.    

16
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,241
 he measures and marks each one 
      to a precise length.      

17
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:53,245
   to avoid fraying the edges   
  or splitting exterior fibers, 

18
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,381
    he makes the cuts slowly.   

19
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:59,385
he smoothes the freshly cut ends
      against a drum sander     

20
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,855
      and tapers them a bit     
    to fit into steel joints.   

21
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,456
  once satisfied with the fit,  

22
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,427
   he removes the bamboo canes  
     from the steel joints.     

23
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:13,799
  he sprays an acetone cleaning 
    solution into the joints    

24
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,068
         and then scrubs        
        with a wire brush       

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,071
   to prepare them for bonding  
      to the bamboo canes.      

26
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:25,210
  a total of five steel joints  

27
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,748
  will hold the bamboo bicycle  
         frame together.        

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,817
 it's now time for the assembly.

29
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,553
      he probes the cavity      
      of each bamboo cane       

30
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,089
           to confirm           
    there are no obstructions   

31
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,626
 and to determine how far inside
     to insert a foam plug.     

32
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,960
 this plug will prevent adhesive

33
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,931
      from running through      
 the entire cane during bonding.

34
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:50,302
      using a long syringe,     

35
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,972
     he injects fast-setting    
  epoxy adhesive into the cane. 

36
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:58,243
   this seals the plug to the   
 inside wall of the bamboo cane.

37
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,046
 once plugs have been installed 
        in all the canes,       

38
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,582
    he snakes plastic tubing    
    through the steel joints    

39
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,451
      and caulks the gaps.      

40
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,187
this tubing is a delivery system

41
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,256
    for the next application    
        of epoxy adhesive       

42
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,860
 that will seal the steel joints
    to the bamboo framework.    

43
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,797
     with the plastic tubing    
          now installed         

44
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,866
    in all the steel joints,    
         he reassembles         

45
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,403
    the bamboo bicycle frame    
 and double-checks the geometry.

46
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,606
  this is known as the dry fit. 

47
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,809
 it's one last chance to perfect
     the fit at the joints.     

48
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:34,813
       he'll sand the ends      
          of the bamboo         

49
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,282
     or even cut a new cane,    
           if needed.           

50
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,920
    most frames need at least   
a little tweaking at this stage.

51
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,756
      once it's just right,     

52
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,027
    he secures the bike frame   
            in a jig.           

53
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,631
 he inserts a bit of epoxy putty

54
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,834
     between the bamboo cane    
      and the steel joint.      

55
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,438
   it acts as a shim to center  
    the cane in the fitting.    

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,574
  he then wraps electrical tape 
         around the gaps        

57
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,644
     where the steel joints     
     meet the bamboo canes.     

58
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,180
     this tape is low-tack,     

59
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,450
   so it won't pull up bamboo   
   fibers when it's removed.    

60
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:12,985
  yet the seal is strong enough 

61
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,654
     to keep epoxy adhesive     
        from dripping out       

62
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:19,391
      as he now injects it      
     into one of the joints.    

63
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:22,928
 he cuts a tiny slit in the tape
      to monitor the flow.      

64
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,531
         and when epoxy         
       starts to leak out,      

65
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,400
     he knows there's enough    
        for a full bond.        

66
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,937
      he tapes up the slit      
    to close off the overflow   

67
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,739
           and clamps           
  the end of the plastic tubing 

68
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,408
       with a clothespin.       

69
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,079
        he injects epoxy        
      into all five joints.     

70
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,150
        once all the gaps       
        have been filled,       

71
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:47,019
 he leaves the assembly to dry. 

72
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,493
         12 hours later,        
     he unbinds the joints.     

73
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,962
    they're now solidly fused   
          to the bamboo         

74
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,931
   to hold the frame together.  

75
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,835
       the plastic tubing       

76
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:06,371
         has also bonded        
  to the inside of the joints.  

77
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,841
     he just cuts the ends.     

78
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,780
 he grinds off the excess epoxy 

79
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,350
    for a smoother transition   
  from the steel to the bamboo. 

80
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,854
       once the bike frame      
        has been cleaned        

81
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,990
          and engraved          
      with the brand name,      

82
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,993
      he stains the bamboo      
   with a polyurethane finish.  

83
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,931
     this seals the pores of    
 the bamboo against water damage

84
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,268
    and enhances the texture    
      of the woody fibers.      

85
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,804
      he paints the joints      
 with automotive-quality paint, 

86
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,675
         and it's ready         
      for a set of wheels.      

87
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:46,211
    this bamboo bicycle frame   
has been 40 hours in the making.

88
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,681
       as an eco-friendly       
     mode of transportation,    

89
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,617
   it should be a trailblazer.  

90
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:07,967
            narrator:           
   when the motorized chainsaw  
 came on the scene in the 1920s,

91
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,702
        it revolutionized       
     the forestry industry.     

92
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,305
          from then on,         
  it was only a matter of time  

93
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,842
before some creative lumberjacks
   started logging extra time   

94
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,376
     with their trusty tool,    

95
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,646
       using the chainsaw       
    like a sculptor's chisel    

96
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,148
      or a painter's brush.     

97
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,720
    these chainsaw sculptures   
          run the gamut         

98
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,788
   from cartoonlike characters  

99
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,191
   to realistic reproductions   
          of wildlife.          

100
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:36,195
   this artistic endeavor does  
   come with significant risk.  

101
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,396
one wrong move with the chainsaw

102
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,999
    can cause serious injury    
            or worse.           

103
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,069
  at the request of landowners  
        and governments,        

104
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,939
  this particular logger artist 
      cuts down bug wood --     

105
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,475
        pine trees killed       
    by mountain pine beetles.   

106
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,679
     brandishing a chainsaw     
     with a 16-inch blade,      

107
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,483
    he'll transform this log    
         into a turkey.         

108
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,418
          the first cut         
      forms a higher back,      

109
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,623
      which will eventually     
    become the tail feathers.   

110
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,026
         the second cut         
establishes the top of the head.

111
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:09,361
     then, he cuts away wood    
           in between           

112
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:13,098
   to begin shaping the body.   

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,234
 he removes wood from the front 

114
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,203
        to begin forming        
 the turkey's beard and breast. 

115
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:23,776
   then, he removes wood from   
  the sides to shape the wings. 

116
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:26,979
      as this is a turkey       
      in a strutting pose,      

117
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,248
            the wings           
     are thrusting downward.    

118
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,851
after shaping the breast further
      and carving the feet,     

119
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,322
   he puts down the chainsaw,   
       picks up a pencil,       

120
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:38,590
 and outlines 19 tail feathers. 

121
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,594
then, he gently carves his lines
  with the tip of the chainsaw. 

122
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,996
         he also carves         
  the outlines of the feathers  

123
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,466
located under the tail feathers.

124
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,002
              then,             
 using the tip ever so lightly, 

125
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:55,340
     he makes delicate lines    
      inside each feather.      

126
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,008
  the rough shape now complete, 

127
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,411
            he begins           
  working on the finer details, 

128
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,815
             such as            
  sculpting each wing feather.  

129
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:07,419
 then, he carves some even finer
  details with a die grinder -- 

130
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,489
       a tool which takes       
      interchangeable bits.     

131
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:15,294
    he uses a cone-shaped bit   
   to carve the turkey's toes,  

132
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:19,498
       then a sanding disk      
    to proportion the breast,   

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,302
   then a small wheel to carve  
   the lower breast feathers.   

134
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,105
   now he tackles the snood --  

135
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,374
        that flap of skin       
     over the turkey's beak.    

136
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,510
   he makes it curved, rather   
   than hanging straight down,  

137
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,515
       to make the turkey       
   look as though it's moving.  

138
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,318
   to craft the eyes, he uses   
   a tool he rigged up himself  

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,721
  by attaching a modified bolt  
        to a die grinder.       

140
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,592
          the eyes are          
   the artistic turning point.  

141
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:50,528
     they add the first hint    
      of facial expression.     

142
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,530
using the cone-shaped bit again,

143
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,333
   the artist shaves off wood   
       underneath the eyes      

144
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,270
  so they'll protrude somewhat. 

145
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,739
 then, using a variety of bits, 

146
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,008
     he does some touch-ups     
          on the snood          

147
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,278
   and sculpts the sac of skin  
    under the turkey's neck.    

148
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,285
              then,             
  he takes the eye tool again,  

149
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,554
     but this time to brand     
 little circles on the skin sac,

150
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,491
 to give it a realistic texture.

151
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:26,031
 with the carving now complete, 
       the burning begins.      

152
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,301
    using a small gas torch,    
      he scorches the wood.     

153
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,237
     the raised area becomes    
 darker than the recessed areas,

154
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,441
       giving the feathers      
       contrast and depth.      

155
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:55,260
  the last step is some finer,  
       detailed texturing.      

156
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,596
  he attaches a soft wire brush 
           to a drill           

157
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,201
        and smoothes out        
    the tips of the feathers.   

158
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,069
  he coats the finished carving 
         in a sealer --         

159
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:08,273
      a homemade concoction     
 of equal parts mineral spirits,

160
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,544
   heavy-duty marine varnish,   
     and boiled linseed oil.    

161
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,281
  this sealer gives the surface 
    a rich, semigloss luster.   

162
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,217
     but, more importantly,     
      it protects the wood      

163
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,420
      against the elements,     
       which is critical,       

164
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:25,490
    given that these carvings   
 are usually displayed outdoors.

165
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,825
 this specially designed sealant

166
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,162
   is the key to the longevity  
       of these carvings.       

167
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,831
    it forms a suit of armor    
      against precipitation     

168
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,701
 and the sun's ultraviolet rays,

169
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,436
         yet the sealant        
    isn't an airtight shield.   

170
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,239
 it still lets the wood breathe,

171
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,241
        which is critical       
   for preventing mold growth.  

172
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,577
 it's also flexible, moving with

173
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,114
      the natural expansion     
  and contraction of the wood.  

174
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,851
   an inflexible sealant would  
  crack, letting water seep in. 

175
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,387
 this durable, protective finish

176
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,391
makes the chainsaw-carved statue
   not only a statement piece   

177
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,294
  but also an investment piece. 

178
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,075
      narrator: bad breath      
   can ruin your social life,   

179
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,345
 but suck on a mint, and you'll 
 be breathing a sigh of relief. 

180
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,148
     mint candies were first    
  introduced in britain in 1790 

181
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,352
       and were initially       
   used to soothe indigestion.  

182
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,889
 later, their breath-freshening 
   qualities were discovered,   

183
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,959
      and they became known     
        as breath mints.        

184
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,363
      out of consideration      
       for their costars,       

185
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,732
          actors often          
      suck on a mint or two     

186
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,700
         before shooting        
        a romantic scene.       

187
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,570
           bad breath           
   can be a real scene-spoiler  

188
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,706
          in the movies         
      and in everyday life.     

189
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,309
            they make           
    these tablet-style mints    

190
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,710
 in various colors and flavors. 

191
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,514
    for a lime-flavored mint,   
 ingredients include sorbitol --

192
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,849
    a sugar-free sweetener --   

193
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,252
       magnesium stearate,      
     which acts as a binder,    

194
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,189
          and lime oil          
   for that refreshing flavor.  

195
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,391
   they load measured amounts   
       of the ingredients       

196
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,527
    into a v-shaped blender.    

197
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,999
      they'll be producing      
        a 300-pound batch       

198
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,602
 that will yield 600,000 mints. 

199
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,740
        that green stuff        
  is a premix of color and oil. 

200
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,346
    he screws the lid tightly   
        onto the blender.       

201
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,885
   it tumbles the ingredients   
         for 45 minutes.        

202
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:38,123
  the magnesium stearate begins 
  to bind the various elements. 

203
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,094
          they then mix         
     blue and yellow pigment    

204
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,263
 to produce a vibrant green one.

205
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,432
    the pigment is a booster    

206
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,967
   to enhance the green color   
           of the mint          

207
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,904
   and reflect the lime flavor  
         of the candies.        

208
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,177
       after one more spin      
         in the blender,        

209
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,448
           the mixture          
     is ready to be pressed.    

210
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,451
   it flows out of the blender  
       and into a big bin.      

211
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,786
      once the bin is full,     

212
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,856
         they deliver it        
 to the tablet-pressing machine.

213
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,593
    here, they scoop the mix    

214
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,730
        into two hoppers        
    that have sieves on top.    

215
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:22,266
      the sieves screen out     
        any large clumps.       

216
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:27,071
    the rest of the mix falls   
  into the rotary tablet press. 

217
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,474
        this is actually        
    the same kind of machine    

218
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,543
that the pharmaceutical industry
     uses for making pills.     

219
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:38,416
 it spins in a blur to punch out
     1,800 tablets a minute.    

220
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,087
 they slow the press to a crawl 
   to give us a close-up look.  

221
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,490
     the granulated mixture     
    flows in metered amounts    

222
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,561
into dies in the rotating wheel.

223
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,630
     upper and lower punches    
        meet in the dies        

224
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,100
           to compress          
   the mint-candy ingredients.  

225
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,804
     this fuses the mixture     
       into hard tablets.       

226
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,241
     after the compression,     

227
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:07,379
     the lower punches rise     
     and eject the candies.     

228
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:11,717
 the mints and the excess powder
       fall down a chute.       

229
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,121
      at the actual speed,      

230
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,590
     the machine churns out     
         dozens of mints        

231
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,927
           faster than          
      you can blink an eye.     

232
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,596
         the tablets and        
     all that excess powder     

233
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,399
            now flow            
   into a perforated cylinder.  

234
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,469
    as the cylinder rotates,    
           the powder           

235
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,940
     flies out of the holes     
   and into the trough below.   

236
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:40,077
   this is known as dedusting.  

237
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,948
        the mint candies,       
minus most of the excess powder,

238
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,551
   spill out into a container.  

239
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,821
         next, the mints        
     ride a revolving table.    

240
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,890
             this is            
    a tablet-counting system.   

241
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,892
  as the mints exit the table,  

242
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,497
light sensors count out a preset
amount of mints for packaging --

243
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,700
     in this case, 72 mints.    

244
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,973
       a worker moves tins      
 into position below the hoppers

245
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,808
      to capture the mints.     

246
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,647
 this kind of tin has been used 
         since the 1920s        

247
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,516
        to contain mints.       

248
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:20,652
      it has a sliding lid      
   that makes it easy to open.  

249
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,321
        but once closed,        
    it contains them tightly,   

250
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,456
      preventing spillage.      

251
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,964
          now it's over         
 to the shrink-wrap department. 

252
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,404
machinery drops a plastic sleeve
  onto each tin as it rides by  

253
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,406
  and under a leveling bracket. 

254
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,009
      the tins then travel      
        through an oven,        

255
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,677
      where a blast of heat     
  softens the plastic sleeves,  

256
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,949
     causing them to shrink     
          to the tins.          

257
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,687
   they emerge securely sealed  
      and ready for retail.     

258
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,956
             today,             
mints can come in exotic shapes,

259
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,625
  like these wine-bottle mints. 

260
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,028
     they can be custom-made    
        for any occasion,       

261
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,399
    because, after all, most    
occasions call for fresh breath.

262
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,719
            narrator:           
the transmission in a motorcycle

263
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,055
      multiplies the power      
     coming from the engine     

264
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:34,458
 to move the bike down the road 
  at faster and faster speeds.  

265
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,529
the vast majority of motorcycles
   have a manual transmission,  

266
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:40,265
     so it's up to the rider    
       to operate a lever       

267
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:44,936
       to shift into lower      
  or higher gears as required.  

268
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:45,937
         [ engine revs ]        

269
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,006
           most manual          
    motorcycle transmissions    

270
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,542
       have a push-button       
       electric starter,        

271
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:54,345
but traditionalists still prefer
   this old-style transmission  

272
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,880
      with a kick starter.      

273
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,550
      the transmission case     
      is made from aluminum     

274
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,152
      that's been extruded      
      to a starting shape.      

275
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,554
       a saw cuts a piece       
       to the case length.      

276
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,824
         then, a series         
    of computer-guided tools    

277
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,426
      hollow out the inside     
        and bore a pocket       

278
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,830
  to hold the bearing in which  
   the main drive gear turns.   

279
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,765
       the main drive gear      

280
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,167
          is what takes         
 power out of the transmission, 

281
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,838
  ultimately rotating the rear  
    wheel of the motorcycle.    

282
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,040
         once polished,         
      the transmission case     

283
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:28,046
       is ready to receive      
    its 100-plus components.    

284
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,050
  workers assemble the bearing  
 in which the main shaft turns, 

285
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:36,054
     transferring power from    
 the engine to the transmission.

286
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,791
  using a press, they push this 
 bearing into a bearing housing,

287
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,861
     then bolt it in place,     
     immobilizing the bolt      

288
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:47,065
  with a few drops of permanent 
      thread-locking fluid.     

289
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,867
       then, right next to      
     the main shaft bearing,    

290
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,004
    workers bolt the bearing    
in which the countershaft turns,

291
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,540
   magnifying and multiplying   
            the power           

292
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,944
 which the main shaft transfers 
  from engine to transmission.  

293
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:04,416
they press in a pin which helps 
accurately position this housing

294
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,954
       when it comes time       
 to bolt it to the transmission.

295
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,556
     they apply thread lock     
     to secure the bushing      

296
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,294
   that holds one of two rods   
   for the bike's shift forks.  

297
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,631
     they're what the rider     
  manipulates to move each gear 

298
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,499
 into a predetermined position. 

299
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:24,235
   they suspend the second rod  

300
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,972
       between the housing      
   and the transmission case.   

301
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,976
  they install the countershaft 
  into the countershaft bearing 

302
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,212
 and lock it in with the press. 

303
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:44,656
     next, workers assemble     
  what's known as the gearset.  

304
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:46,724
 this is a 6-speed transmission,

305
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,728
 which means there are six gears
        on the main shaft       

306
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,263
  and six on the countershaft.  

307
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,931
 each gear is held to its shaft 

308
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,202
       by a high-strength       
      steel retaining ring      

309
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,603
 that's plated with yellow zinc 

310
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,073
 to make it easy to verify that 
   it's in the right position.  

311
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,678
        workers lubricate       
     the bearings thoroughly    

312
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,149
      to ensure they rotate     
   smoothly around the shafts.  

313
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,428
       putting the gearset      
         aside for now,         

314
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,296
they use the press once again --

315
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,166
      this time, to install     
   the main drive-gear bearing  

316
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,702
into the pocket they bore for it
    in the transmission case.   

317
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,704
          the red disk          
    merely provides a cushion   

318
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,142
      to prevent the press      
  from damaging the component.  

319
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:43,982
   next, they press the main    
   drive gear in the bearing.   

320
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,184
         again, they use        
      the installation disk     

321
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,920
    to cushion the component    
         from the press.        

322
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:01,800
     they slide the gearset     
   into the transmission case   

323
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:05,269
  and secure it with nine nuts. 

324
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:08,406
    they apply semipermanent    
    thread lock to each nut     

325
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,608
  so that they can be unscrewed 
         in the future,         

326
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,012
     should the gearset need    
    to be removed for repair.   

327
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,884
  meanwhile, a computer-guided  
  mill machines the shift drum  

328
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,487
     out of a super-durable     
         type of steel.         

329
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,223
     the shift drum rotates     
  when the rider shifts gears,  

330
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,857
        moving the gears.       

331
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,295
 after coating it in black oxide
  to prevent against corrosion, 

332
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,965
         they install it        
on top of the transmission case.

333
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,035
 they assemble the kick starter.

334
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:38,903
    when the rider kicks it,    
        a series of gears       

335
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,039
     rotates the main shaft     
    inside the transmission.    

336
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,843
         the main shaft         
is also connected to the engine,

337
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,313
        so this rotation        
       starts the engine.       

338
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,984
the kick arm itself is stainless
    steel. the pedal, bronze.   

339
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,252
       both types of metal      
       are durable enough       

340
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,357
  to withstand years of kicking 
 and are resistant to corrosion.

341
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,527
   for demonstration purposes,  

342
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,862
     this transmission case     
        has been cut away       

343
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,332
  to show what happens inside   
  when the rider shifts gears.  

344
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,802
     the shift drum rotates     
           30 degrees           

345
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,870
    to pull the transmission    
        out of one gear,        

346
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,674
     then another 30 degrees    
    to put it into another --   

347
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:21,078
  a perfectly engineered piece  
  of mechanical choreography.
