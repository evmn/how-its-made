00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,452
  narrator: whether tightening  
     the wheels on your bike    

4
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,721
     or working on your car,    

5
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:56,788
      a combination wrench      

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,924
   can make the toughest jobs   
         safe and easy.         

7
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,793
  the best combination wrench   
  gives you reach and strength  

8
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,128
  and won't bust your knuckles  

9
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,664
       when you're working      
 in those hard-to-reach places. 

10
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,335
   a high-quality combination   
 wrench can last you a lifetime.

11
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,477
  a combination wrench tightens 
   and loosens nuts and bolts   

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
   using its u-shaped open end  

13
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:25,284
     or its enclosed box end    
     with a hexagonal shape.    

14
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:29,554
    combination wrenches come   
  in imperial and metric sizes. 

15
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,691
  to start, a steel bar travels 
   into a die-cutting machine   

16
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,962
    that cuts it into lengths   
         called billets.        

17
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,765
           each billet          
      will become a wrench.     

18
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,307
           one by one,          

19
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:52,644
   a machine feeds the billets  
    into an induction heater.   

20
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,848
      it heats them to more     
 than 1,800 degrees fahrenheit, 

21
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,518
         then sends them        
      into a forging press,     

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,655
   where the first die creates  
   the wrench's general shape.  

23
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,025
         the second die         
  gives it its finished shape.  

24
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,662
          and the third         
   trims off the excess metal.  

25
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,668
          the wrenches          
      exit the forge press      

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,972
    and cool off on their way   
     into a collection box.     

27
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,076
    then a worker grinds off    
         the trim line,         

28
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,344
   a thin line of excess metal  

29
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,281
      created when the top      
 and bottom dies come together. 

30
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,351
      he loads the wrenches     

31
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,221
        into an automatic       
     edge-polishing machine.    

32
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,690
 using an 80-grit sanding belt, 

33
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:43,395
the machine grinds the trim line
  on both sides of the handle.  

34
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,303
       the wrenches leave       
   the edge-polishing machine   

35
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,571
         trim-line-free.        

36
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:03,181
a worker then places each wrench
 onto a 75-ton hydraulic press, 

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,653
 which stamps it with the brand 
  name, size, and part number.  

38
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,795
     this bend machine gives    
 the box end a 15-degree angle. 

39
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,064
 a vertical milling machine then
 drills a hole into the box end,

40
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,868
 using coolant to keep the drill
        from overheating.       

41
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,208
       this is a hydraulic      
       hex broach machine.      

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,147
  the broach tool is what gives 
   the hole a hexagonal shape.  

43
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,360
    open-end wrenches also go   
 through a broaching operation. 

44
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,829
  in this case, the broach tool 
       shapes the open end      

45
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,799
     into the desired size.     

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,640
      a worker then grinds      
  the open end of the wrenches  

47
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,644
         and makes sure         
    they're perfectly smooth.   

48
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,515
    the wrenches now undergo    

49
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,517
          a three-stage         
    heat-tempering procedure    

50
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,453
    to harden and strengthen    
           the metal.           

51
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,461
 for some combination wrenches, 

52
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,130
     a sliding machine cuts     
  an opening out of the box end 

53
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,367
     that has the hex shape     
        broached into it.       

54
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,138
      this turns the wrench     
     into a flare nut wrench    

55
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,740
   that's ideal for working on  
      hard-to-reach bolts,      

56
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,709
    like on a hydraulic line.   

57
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,949
         ceramic stones         
     and a chemical solution    

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,486
       polish the wrenches      
        for eight hours,        

59
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,055
           giving them          
     a bright luster finish.    

60
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,696
a machine then dips the wrenches
 into a nickel-plating solution 

61
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,898
      that helps make them      
      corrosion-resistant.      

62
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,635
      this series of baths      

63
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,238
     then plate the wrenches    
     with trivalent chrome,     

64
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,372
        which is a safer,       

65
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,508
  more environmentally friendly 
           alternative          

66
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,044
 to traditional plating methods.

67
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,848
  after a final rinse in water, 

68
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,218
      the wrenches come out     
 with a bright cosmetic finish. 

69
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,525
    combination wrenches are    
 available in a variety of sets,

70
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,528
   all conveniently organized   
       and neatly stored.       

71
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,196
        since the 1920s,        

72
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,466
  this company has been making  
      combination wrenches      

73
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,801
     of all shapes and sizes    

74
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,205
            for jobs            
    of all shapes and sizes.    

75
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,618
       narrator: in a time      
   of health-conscious eating,  

76
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,020
           deli meats           
   remain a mealtime favorite.  

77
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,822
         almost everyone        
 loves a great-tasting sandwich 

78
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,424
  or sausage hot off the grill. 

79
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:03,028
 today, the best deli meats are 
 prepared from the leanest cuts.

80
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,495
     they have no trans fat,    

81
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,965
     they are low in sodium     
       and saturated fat,       

82
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,034
     and contain no fillers.    

83
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,308
     some companies prepare     
   deli meats largely by hand   

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,010
           to maintain          
    that old-world tradition.   

85
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:27,085
     sausages begin as cuts     
  of fresh meats in a grinder.  

86
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:35,126
         the ground meat        
 falls into a collection tub... 

87
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,730
  which then deposits the meats 
          into a mixer.         

88
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,802
           adding ice           
 keeps the meats cold and fresh.

89
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,736
     a worker then adds salt    

90
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,940
     and all-natural spices     
         and seasonings.        

91
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,882
            the mixer           
     blends it all together.    

92
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,886
            a worker            
 feeds a natural sausage casing 

93
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,755
         into a machine         
     called a sausage linker    

94
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,658
      that forms and links      
          the sausages.         

95
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,964
a look inside the sausage linker

96
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,501
reveals where the meat is pumped
     into the natural casing    

97
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,271
           and shaped           
 into the desired sausage size. 

98
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,842
         as the sausages        
     come out of the linker,    

99
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,777
         they hook onto         
       a conveyor system.       

100
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,348
       they're ready to go      
into the smokehouse for cooking.

101
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,585
 workers send the cooked sausage
          into an oven          

102
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,922
          that destroys         
 any possible surface bacteria. 

103
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,795
     they pack the sausages     
       into plastic bags,       

104
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,298
     which are date-stamped.    

105
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,936
         then a machine         
   vacuum-seals the packages,   

106
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,172
making them ready for the store.

107
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,742
      an olive loaf begins      

108
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:01,346
    with a mixture of olives,   
     pickles, and pimientos.    

109
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,816
    again, a worker adds salt   
   and all-natural seasonings,  

110
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,253
     mixing it together with    
  blended fresh beef and pork.  

111
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,428
      this stuffer machine      
         fills loaf pans        

112
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,296
 with the season-blended meats. 

113
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,771
   another worker puts a rack   

114
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,840
           filled with          
      uncooked olive loaves     

115
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,876
     into a smokehouse oven.    

116
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,915
    after an initial cooking    
    that sets the loaf shape,   

117
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,450
      he removes the loaves     
         from the oven.         

118
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,254
 at this time, only the exposed 
 part of the loaves is browned. 

119
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,790
       after he takes them      
        out of the pans,        

120
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,993
 they will go back into the oven
       to brown all sides.      

121
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,796
     it takes about 10 hours    

122
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,966
     to cook these special      
     european-style loaves.     

123
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,339
         another worker         
 loads pepperoni into a machine 

124
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,941
    called a revolving horn.    

125
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,077
       it stuffs a casing       
 with a mixture of beef and pork

126
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,346
  seasoned with italian spices. 

127
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,085
   the horn stuffs the casing   
 with the precise amount of meat

128
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,021
      and seals both ends.      

129
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,030
          the pepperoni         
    is then hung up on a rack   

130
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,933
   and taken into a smokehouse  
          for cooking.          

131
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,038
         another worker         
     prepares german bologna    

132
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,173
           by slipping          
      a natural beef casing     

133
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,676
         onto a machine         
     called a stuffing horn.    

134
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,581
      he stuffs the casing      
 with a mixture of beef and pork

135
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,783
     and all-natural spices     
         and seasonings.        

136
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,088
 he seals the end of the casing 
      with aluminum clips.      

137
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,926
         another worker,        
   using a paddle with spikes,  

138
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,330
 perforates the casing to allow 
  air to escape during cooking  

139
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,333
            to ensure           
   even cooking and browning.   

140
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,940
            now it's            
    the german bologna's turn   

141
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,077
  for a stay in the smokehouse. 

142
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,478
    about eight hours later,    

143
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,449
       the german bologna       
       is evenly cooked.        

144
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,889
 using a guide, a worker slices 
   the sausage into even cuts,  

145
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,426
      which are then packed     
        and date-stamped.       

146
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,431
  from authentic german bologna 

147
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,701
    to all types of sausages    
  and distinctive deli loaves,  

148
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,871
           deli meats           
  are served around the world.  

149
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,182
            narrator:           
   scotland is the birthplace   

150
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,583
          both of golf          
   and the motorized golf car,  

151
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,587
  invented in 1946 by a dentist 
    named john "doc" keegan.    

152
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,122
      since the late 1950s,     

153
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,992
  golf cars have become widely  
  used on courses everywhere.   

154
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,863
 they're built low to the ground
        to remain steady,       

155
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,632
            even over           
    the most uneven terrain.    

156
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,605
  this battery-powered golf car 

157
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,076
has everything to get you around
      in comfort and style.     

158
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,412
        it can't help you       
        with your swing,        

159
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,515
       but it<i> can</i> get you       
  to the next hole in a jiffy.  

160
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,753
  to make a golf car, the first 
   step is to build the frame   

161
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,955
        with lightweight        
        aluminum i-beams.       

162
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,424
         they go through        
      two separate machines     

163
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,527
    to bend them into shape.    

164
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,564
           metal forms          
      press down into vinyl     

165
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,201
  and stretch it into the shape 
  of the front and back seats.  

166
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:50,308
workers cut and staple the vinyl
       over a plywood base      

167
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,044
      covered with a layer      
        of foam padding.        

168
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,845
 they trim away the excess vinyl

169
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,482
   and set the finished seats   
             aside.             

170
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,655
          now it's time         
  to assemble the power train.  

171
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,859
   here, workers place an axle  
     onto the differential,     

172
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,462
    which rotates the wheels.   

173
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,935
          they cover it         
      with a staff ring...      

174
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,805
       then bolt the car's      
     48-volt electric motor     

175
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,606
       onto the transaxle,      

176
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:27,812
   the assembled transmission,  
  differential, and drive axle. 

177
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,749
  they assemble the car's frame 
          on a fixture,         

178
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,353
 starting with the driver side, 
   then the passenger side...   

179
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:39,290
   then the center i-beam that  
  holds the two sides together. 

180
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,229
  they set the assembled frame  
      onto the power train      

181
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,566
    and bolt the car's front    
  suspension mechanism onto it. 

182
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,038
       as the car moves on      
  to the next assembly station, 

183
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,840
 a plastic underbody comes down 

184
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,710
            to cover            
  the front part of the frame.  

185
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:02,580
     workers now set in the     
  accelerator and brake pedal.  

186
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,516
         then they lower        
      the power compartment     

187
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,953
  that holds the car's battery  
     at the vehicle's rear.     

188
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,860
 they connect the battery to the
 motor with four separate wires,

189
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,663
        then hook them up       
 to the electric control module 

190
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,732
    that commands the engine.   

191
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,734
       now they can cover       
     the rear working parts     

192
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,335
   with the plastic underbody.  

193
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,140
          the underbody         
      provides the support      

194
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,876
       on which to install      
    the car's working parts,    

195
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,980
    like this pedal mechanism   
     or the steering column.    

196
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,016
     all the electric tools     
        that apply torque       

197
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,018
     are computer-monitored.    

198
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,953
 if the amount of torque applied

199
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,023
        at any of the 130       
 assembly stations is incorrect,

200
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,094
the system prevents the car from
  advancing to the next station 

201
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,829
    until they get it right.    

202
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,699
  this eliminates any problems  
        that might arise        

203
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,036
       with over-tightened      
         or loose bolts.        

204
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,911
       workers now tighten      
       the battery wires,       

205
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,513
   then check the accelerator.  

206
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,650
 golf cars may not attain speeds
  higher than 15 miles per hour 

207
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,553
          in compliance         
   with industry regulations.   

208
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,057
        next, they set in       
    the front and back seats    

209
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,194
      that fit snugly into      
  the molded plastic rear body  

210
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,598
  and screw in the front fascia 
   that covers the underbody.   

211
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,669
they set the brake rod in place,

212
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,471
       make sure it moves       
    the brake pedal properly,   

213
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,607
         and tighten it.        

214
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,278
   the screen located overhead  

215
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,448
 indicates when they've applied 
just the right amount of torque.

216
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,419
            finally,            
   they hammer in the hubcaps   

217
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,955
           and set in           
     the front beauty panel,    

218
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,357
  also made of molded plastic.  

219
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,362
  the car's now fully assembled 
       and ready to roll.       

220
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,366
     the finished golf cars     
     offload automatically      

221
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,569
     from the assembly line     
   thanks to a hydraulic lift.  

222
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,842
   they get a final inspection  
       from every angle --      

223
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,811
      even under the seat.      

224
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:25,122
   finally, workers drive them  
       to an outdoor lot.       

225
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,525
          no worries --         
     their aluminum chassis     

226
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,062
  ensures they can endure even  
the harshest weather conditions.

227
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,664
              soon,             
   they'll carry eager golfers  

228
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,734
         across courses         
      throughout the world.     

229
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,281
            narrator:           
     an airship is basically    
     a large helium balloon     

230
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,949
 with an engine for propulsion. 

231
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,820
 the passengers and crew ride in
 a gondola suspended underneath.

232
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,356
  when there's an inside frame  
         supporting it,         

233
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,358
           the airship          
     is called a rigid type.    

234
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,559
   when there's no framework,   

235
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,697
  it's called a nonrigid type,  
            or blimp.           

236
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,969
      the envelope material     

237
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,840
 is made of five polyester-based
    fabrics bonded together.    

238
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:20,511
 it's lightweight, yet resistant
 to harsh weather and u.v. rays.

239
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,581
 the crew inflates the envelope 
          with helium,          

240
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,184
   an inert, nonflammable gas.  

241
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,186
   at the back of the envelope  

242
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,922
      are a rudder and fins     
          for steering.         

243
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,392
     the factory constructs     
        each fin's frame        

244
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,662
          out of tough,         
    lightweight carbon fiber.   

245
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,330
 workers coat it with adhesive, 

246
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,533
           then apply           
  a polyester aircraft fabric,  

247
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,571
      adding extra adhesive     
       to seal the seams.       

248
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,412
      then, using an iron,      

249
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,949
   they heat-shrink the fabric  
        until it's taut.        

250
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:04,555
  they repeat this process with 
two additional layers of fabric,

251
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,958
      then paint it white.      

252
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,696
       they mount the fins      
     to the airship envelope    

253
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,766
       with a combination       
    of steel cables and rope.   

254
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,701
   the steel cables are rigid,  

255
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,305
 but the rope has some give when
 the envelope flexes in flight. 

256
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,845
 a system of cables and pulleys 

257
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,515
   connect the rudder and fin   
         to the cockpit.        

258
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,919
   the pilot manipulates them   
           with yokes.          

259
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,522
            the flaps           
  control up-and-down movement, 

260
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,391
 the rudder, sideways movement. 

261
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,397
 engineers inspect the envelope 
   inside and out for pinholes  

262
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,699
            to ensure           
     no helium can leak out.    

263
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,270
      to repair a pinhole,      

264
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,806
   technicians first cover it   
      with a piece of tape,     

265
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,310
   then brush on some adhesive  
     in a circular pattern.     

266
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,416
   they apply a circular patch  

267
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,886
   made of the same five-layer  
     fabric as the envelope.    

268
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,758
 using a spatula, they push out 
       air and excess glue      

269
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,761
  to ensure airtight adhesion.  

270
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,298
        the airship runs        
on two gasoline-powered engines.

271
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,366
       workers hoist them       
       into the engine bay      

272
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,801
   at the back of the gondola.  

273
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:30,908
the propeller's sharp blades are
  encased in a duct for safety. 

274
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,112
one propeller goes on each side.

275
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,049
           the blades           
     of the propeller pivot     

276
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,251
 to move the airship in reverse 

277
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,388
     without having to stop     
           the engine.          

278
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,992
  the cockpit electrical panel  
    has gas-management gauges   

279
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,662
  because as the airship rises, 
       the helium expands.      

280
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,065
   so the pilot has to reduce   
air pressure inside the envelope

281
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,134
    to keep it from bursting.   

282
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,638
 in a pinch, the pilot can also 
  open a valve to vent helium.  

283
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,342
    to test the helium valve,   

284
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,145
           technicians          
     blow in pressurized air    

285
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,213
      while brushing liquid     
         along the edge.        

286
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:13,484
   any bubbles indicate leaks   
       that need sealing.       

287
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,888
   the valve opens and closes   
     with levers and cables.    

288
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,823
   unlike electronic controls,  

289
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,294
cables can be repaired in midair
      if something breaks.      

290
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,032
      inside the envelope,      

291
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,235
     they install air sacks     
        called ballonets,       

292
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,637
 the gray areas in this diagram.

293
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,840
the pilot deflates the ballonets
             to rise            

294
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,043
  and inflates them to descend. 

295
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,248
         workers attach         
    the envelope and gondola    

296
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,383
 with cables, belts, and braces 

297
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,054
     and fill a ballast tank    
  under the gondola with water. 

298
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,389
        in an emergency,        

299
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:55,459
   the crew can dump the water  
    for a boost of buoyancy.    

300
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:59,263
      the gondola also has      
   compartments for shot bags,  

301
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,066
     22-pound bags of lead.     

302
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,536
         before takeoff,        
   the pilot checks the weight  

303
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,272
   with passengers, equipment,  
       and fuel on board.       

304
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,408
          then the crew         
     loads enough shot bags     

305
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,743
     to balance the airship.    

306
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,515
      to park the airship,      
 they lock its nose onto a mast.

307
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,558
    just before flight time,    

308
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,427
      a truck tows the mast     
       out of the hangar.       

309
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,763
  then it's all hands on deck.  

310
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:37,802
   well, actually, all hands    
   on gondola, until takeoff.   

311
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,447
