    discovery communications

00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,853
            narrator:           
   the drive in your computer   

4
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,455
  saves and stores your data -- 

5
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:00,459
    everything from documents   
 to photos to software programs.

6
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,596
   the newer generation drives  
     are solid state drives.    

7
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:07,265
  they're gradually replacing   
  traditional hard disk drives  

8
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,936
    because they're compact,    
          more durable,         

9
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:12,672
     and process information    
          much faster.          

10
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:16,875
  just like portable usb drives 
    and camera memory cards,    

11
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,945
       solid state drives       
       store information        

12
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,215
     on several memory chips    
  installed on a circuit board. 

13
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,352
       each chip contains       
    highly complex circuitry    

14
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,621
comprised of electrical pathways

15
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,890
      2,000 times narrower      
       than a human hair.       

16
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,226
   to make those memory chips,  

17
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,363
         they begin with        
  a disk-shaped silicon wafer.  

18
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,366
    silicon is a non-metallic   
         natural element        

19
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,967
   that conducts electricity.   

20
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,637
     it's highly susceptible    
        to contamination,       

21
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,572
     so the production area     
      is virtually sterile      

22
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,442
      to the point of being     
       1,000 times cleaner      

23
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,312
          than the air          
  in a hospital operating room. 

24
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,247
   an automated robotic system  

25
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,584
    moves the wafers through    
    more than 800 operations,   

26
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,720
  which take more than a month  
          to complete.          

27
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,190
    each wafer receives layer   
   after layer of materials --  

28
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,193
some conductive, such as copper,

29
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,596
       some nonconductive,      
    such as silicon dioxide.    

30
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,665
   after applying each layer,   

31
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:16,402
  the machine coats the wafer   
  with a light-sensitive fluid  

32
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,738
 then flashes u.v. light onto it

33
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,675
 through a glass stencil of the 
 electrical circuitry pattern.  

34
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,144
  in the areas where the fluid  
    is exposed to the light,    

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,414
    the chemicals break down    
          and dissolve.         

36
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,617
  where the fluid was shielded  
   from light by the stencil,   

37
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,885
  the materials remain intact,  

38
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,423
    effectively printing the    
 circuitry pattern on the wafer.

39
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:41,694
  chemical baths then wash away 
 the exposed fluid and material.

40
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:45,030
      each foot-wide wafer      
 yields hundreds of microchips, 

41
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,632
            which now           
    have to be sliced apart.    

42
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,568
   the robotic cutting machine  

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,438
        covers the wafer        
      with an adhesive film     

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,040
   to hold the chips in place   

45
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,975
  while they're being cut loose 
        from each other.        

46
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,578
        the next machine        
        inserts each clip       

47
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,014
in a protective plastic housing.

48
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,385
           meanwhile,           
  six circuit boards at a time  

49
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,720
         enter a machine        

50
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,856
   which applies a thin layer   
   of tin alloy solder paste    

51
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,190
         onto the areas         

52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,528
     where the memory chips     
  and other components will go. 

53
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,132
 as the boards exit the machine,
     a robotic arm picks off    

54
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:24,136
   the components required for  
  each drive from feeder spools 

55
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,538
        and deposits them       

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,740
  at their respective locations 
      on the circuit board.     

57
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:31,610
      this particular model     
        has 8 microchips,       

58
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:35,080
       each able to store       
      64 gigabytes of data,     

59
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,752
   giving the drive a capacity  
         of 5,012 gigs.         

60
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,688
  the circuit boards now enter  
      a tunnel-shaped oven      

61
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,423
  which melts the solder paste, 

62
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,759
      fusing the components     
          to the board.         

63
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,097
            the brain           
    of the solid state drive    

64
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,532
         is now complete        

65
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,035
  and ready for the first phase 
   of quality-control testing.  

66
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,438
          this machine          
    performs an optical scan    

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,374
 to verify that every component 
          on the board          

68
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,443
   is set in the right place.   

69
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,651
        the next machine        
        x-rays the board        

70
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,520
  to verify that each component 

71
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,722
      is securely soldered      
    in the correct location.    

72
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,925
          a later phase         
   of quality-control testing   

73
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,327
           will verify          
    the drive's performance.    

74
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,597
  until now, six circuit boards 

75
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,399
       have been attached       
         to each other.         

76
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,002
      an automated router       
      now cuts them apart,      

77
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,937
  and workers insert each board 

78
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,540
        into a protective       
        plastic housing.        

79
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,675
      a slot on the outside     
         of this housing        

80
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,144
  reveals the board's connector 

81
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:41,947
    by which the drive links    
        to the computer.        

82
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,885
       solid state drives       
    come in different sizes.    

83
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,019
      this particular model     
         is large enough        

84
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,222
           to replace           
 a traditional hard disk drive. 

85
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,491
            however,            
    many models are smaller,    

86
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,828
         designed to fit        
   where disk drives can't --   

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,031
          for example,          
     in ultra-slim laptops.     

88
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,901
     every drive is labeled     

89
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,571
with its technical specs, model,
  and serial numbers and so on, 

90
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,274
      along with a barcode      
    for production tracking.    

91
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,846
   then they plug the drive's   
    connector into a tester,    

92
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,180
     which, after verifying     

93
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,515
         that everything        
    functions electronically,   

94
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,318
      installs the drive's      
        operating system.       

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,454
         the drive moves        
      to the next station,      

96
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,656
       where it undergoes       

97
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,725
        up to 60 hours of       
  extensive performance testing 

98
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,061
    to ensure that it stores    
       and retrieves data       

99
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,964
 correctly and at target speed. 

100
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,734
      packaging is twofold.     

101
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,069
      first, a foil shield      

102
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,472
  to prevent static electricity 
    from damaging the drive,    

103
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,607
         then a carton,         

104
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,876
 and finally into a shipping box

105
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,681
    headed for a destination    
   somewhere around the world.  

106
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,264
   narrator: in ancient egypt,  

107
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,334
       both men and women       
       painted their eyes.      

108
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,135
 it was thought that eye makeup 

109
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,671
    made one less vulnerable    
        to the evil eye,        

110
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,674
         a gaze or stare        
      meant to cause harm.      

111
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,010
  today, mostly women wear it.  

112
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,945
  and of course, repelling evil 

113
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,548
      is no longer a reason     
       to wear eye shadow.      

114
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:27,887
  with a palette of eye shadow, 

115
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,956
        a woman can work        
    a certain kind of magic.    

116
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,026
 skillful shading can add depth 
     and drama to the eyes.     

117
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,828
           this makeup          
  can also create the illusion  

118
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,967
  that the eyes are much larger 
      than they really are.     

119
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,772
       to make eye shadow,      
  they follow specific recipes. 

120
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,508
          a technician          
     weighs the ingredients,    

121
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,578
      beginning with mica,      
 a mineral that acts as filler. 

122
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,782
       the next ingredient      
        is zinc stearate.       

123
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,117
         it's a binder.         

124
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:02,388
    a combination of pigments   
   provides the desired color.  

125
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,523
    these particular pigments   

126
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,826
      are different shades      
   of the mineral iron oxide.   

127
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,399
          he transfers          
    the measured ingredients    

128
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,067
      to a big blender jar.     

129
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,470
  as he pours the ingredients,  
          they dust up,         

130
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,206
    and a gas mask keeps him    
from breathing in the particles.

131
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,810
        he places the jar       
      on the blender base,      

132
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,549
         covers the top,        
    and activates the blades.   

133
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,553
  the blender mixes and grinds  
    the powdered ingredients    

134
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,090
      to a very fine state.     

135
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:41,560
         then it's into         
       a very large mixer.      

136
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,629
     he adds coconut oil --     

137
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,831
           just enough          
  for the powdered ingredients  

138
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,234
     to eventually coagulate    
        into a cake form.       

139
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,570
      more mica is next --      

140
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,238
           a lot more.          

141
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,974
     eye shadow is 80% mica.    

142
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,511
       this mica is darker      
 to add intensity to the color. 

143
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,580
  it also has a bit of shimmer. 

144
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,850
       he latches the lid       
   to contain the ingredients   

145
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,852
          and powers up         
     this high-speed mixer.     

146
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,722
   inside, the mixing paddles   

147
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,724
          swivel around         
      for about 15 minutes      

148
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,795
        to thoroughly mix       
        the ingredients.        

149
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:20,799
     the eye shadow mixture     
    flows into a plastic bag.   

150
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,934
    a technician examines it    

151
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,338
    to confirm that the color   
    has been evenly dispersed   

152
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,406
       and that the powder      
     is sufficiently moist.     

153
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:32,210
    another worker now pieces   
      four eye shadow tins      

154
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,947
   in pods on a metal platter.  

155
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,752
 the platter rotates to deliver 
 the tins to a mixing dispenser 

156
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,621
       that's been filled       
with the eye shadow ingredients.

157
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:46,758
the mixer pushes precise amounts
   through holes in the bottom  

158
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,127
       and into the tins.       

159
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,564
 a scraper levels off the tops. 

160
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:01,840
    the next stop is a press    
    with four circular heads.   

161
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,776
       a ribbon of fabric       
      keeps things hygienic     

162
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,046
     as the press compresses    
   the moist eye shadow powder  

163
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,815
          and turns it          
     into a cake-like form.     

164
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:15,386
         moving forward,        
    the pods eject the tins,    

165
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,658
     and an automated device    
   pulls them off the machine.  

166
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,661
        what a difference       
    the compression has made.   

167
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,463
    no longer a loose powder,   

168
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:29,334
   the eye shadow ingredients   
      have caked up nicely.     

169
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,203
  the tins now move into a lane 

170
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,805
       and come up against      
        an abrasive belt        

171
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,474
  that cleans the loose powder  
         from the sides.        

172
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:40,345
  a blast of air also gets rid  
 of some of the residual powder.

173
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:44,215
    for one out of every 100    
      eye shadows produced,     

174
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:49,287
  a technician does a drop test 
   from a height of 18 inches.  

175
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,356
            he checks           
     for chipping or damage.    

176
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,494
      and if he finds any,      
  he'll add power to the press. 

177
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,496
        for a color test,       

178
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:00,098
   he brushes some eye shadow   
          onto his arm,         

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,468
         beginning with         
     a laboratory standard.     

180
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,039
         he then applies        

181
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,641
  newly manufactured eye shadow 
           to his arm           

182
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,176
      and compares the two.     

183
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,578
          it's a match.         

184
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,046
     and with his approval,     

185
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,448
    the batch is almost ready   
           for retail.          

186
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,850
 another worker inserts the tins

187
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,053
      into more substantial     
       plastic containers       

188
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:25,023
   with magnets on the bottom   
         to secure them.        

189
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,594
    she screws the clear caps   
         onto the jars,         

190
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:33,665
and the eye shadow is on its way
    to the cosmetic counter.    

191
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,806
      they also manufacture     
  entire palettes of eye shadow 

192
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,574
    for a rainbow of choices.   

193
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:50,649
      it takes about a day      
   to manufacture eye shadow.   

194
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,488
     and the result is truly    
       a thing of beauty.       

195
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,975
            narrator:           
  the first stretch limousines, 

196
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,376
       built around 1928,       

197
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:22,314
  usually transported big bands 
  and their musical equipment.  

198
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,850
          luxury sedans         
    with an extended chassis    

199
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,720
    are typically associated    
     with special occasions     

200
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,658
    such as weddings, proms,    
    or a night on the town.     

201
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:39,397
it takes about 475 hours of work
     and painstaking detail     

202
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,269
   to transform a luxury sedan  
      into a stretch limo.      

203
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:49,474
workers cut an ordinary-size car
  in half using cutting wheels. 

204
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,942
     before cutting begins,     

205
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,411
      the inside of the car     
        is stripped away,       

206
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,013
   along with other components  

207
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,482
      such as the gas tank      
        and drive shaft.        

208
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,352
        workers cut away        
   the inner support structure  

209
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,821
         and cut across         
      the floor of the car      

210
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,090
    with a reciprocating saw.   

211
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:13,698
         the car is now         
     completely cut in half.    

212
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,767
          workers wheel         
    the back half of the car    

213
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,003
    away from the front half.   

214
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,442
    they place the back half    
        on the exact spot       

215
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:28,313
       where the limousine      
  will gradually be assembled.  

216
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,782
   the construction department  
            employees           

217
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,253
    insert steel frame rails    
 into the front half of the car.

218
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:40,592
      they insert the rails     
 on both sides of the front half

219
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,029
   before inserting the rails   
 into the back half of the car. 

220
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,467
     they measure the length    
       of the frame rails       

221
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,069
          to make sure          
    that the frame is square    

222
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,739
     and that the two halves    
 are the correct distance apart 

223
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:59,277
     to build the limousine.    

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,947
    a worker welds the rails    
          to the frames         

225
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,816
  of the front and back halves  
      of the original car.      

226
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,218
          they position         
     the drive shaft tunnel,    

227
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,288
     which houses the steel     
 drive shaft and exhaust pipes, 

228
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,893
           and weld it          
 to the original vehicle tunnel.

229
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,230
    they position the floor,    

230
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,433
          which is made         
      of galvanized steel,      

231
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,503
 and weld it to the frame rails 
           and tunnel.          

232
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:30,175
 they weld the steel roof rails 
           into place.          

233
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,577
   they connect the new rails   

234
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,080
        to the roof rails       
    in the original vehicle.    

235
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,188
    a worked welds a vertical   
      side post into place.     

236
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,455
          with a level,         

237
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,525
         he checks that         
   the post of hardened steel   

238
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,592
      is perfectly vertical     

239
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,462
         before welding         
      the base of the post      

240
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,131
       to the floor frame.      

241
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,535
          a roof panel          
    made of galvanized steel    

242
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,937
        is put in place.        

243
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,740
         workers install        
      the limousine's bar.      

244
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:07,479
    they've already installed   
     the steel seat frames.     

245
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,816
       next, they install       
       an outer body panel      

246
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:14,419
          complete with         
   a hardened steel crash bar.  

247
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,822
they screw the panel into place.

248
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,090
   the screws will be removed   

249
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:23,628
    once the panel has bonded   
 solidly to the limousine frame.

250
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,466
       a worker sprays on       
      three coats of paint,     

251
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:31,970
     then applies two coats     
  of protective clear coating.  

252
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:36,241
    once the painting process   
          is complete,          

253
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:40,011
         workers install        
the laminated safety side glass.

254
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,849
         another worker         
      sprays contact cement     

255
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,650
  on the roof of the limousine  

256
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,252
         in preparation         
       for the vinyl top.       

257
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,188
     he stretches the vinyl     
         across the roof        

258
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,592
 and with his hand presses the  
 fabric down into the crevices. 

259
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,997
   then he carefully trims off  
           the excess.          

260
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,401
       he presses a strip       
  of chrome molding into place  

261
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:06,405
    on the top of the vinyl.    

262
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,541
             workers            
   in the interior department   

263
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,410
        install the back        
      of a leather seat...      

264
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,213
   and the leather bench seat.  

265
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,886
      after reupholstering      
the original rear seat to match,

266
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,754
         they return it         
      to its original spot      

267
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:27,025
  in the back of the limousine. 

268
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,826
       a systems installer      

269
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,630
 connects the electrical systems
     for the control center,    

270
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,832
             located            
    behind the driver's seat.   

271
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,635
 a panel lists relays and fuses.

272
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,872
   the original center console  
      is then reinstalled.      

273
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,510
        a worker installs       
         a video monitor        

274
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,045
        in the limousine.       

275
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,784
       next, he rolls out       
         the floor mats.        

276
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:57,289
      the acrylic disco bar     
   lighting system is tested.   

277
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,326
        in just 21 days,        

278
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,864
 the original car is transformed
   into a luxurious limousine.  

279
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,334
      with test drives and      
quality-control checks complete,

280
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,704
          enjoy a ride          
      in the lap of luxury.     

281
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,884
       narrator: a hammer       

282
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:28,687
 is one of the most useful tools
           out there.           

283
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:32,023
       the only problem is      
you have to control the rebound.

284
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,093
    that is, unless you have    
       a dead blow hammer.      

285
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,963
    these tools are accurate    
         and easy to use        

286
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,233
  because this particular type  
       absorbs the bounce.      

287
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,973
  this facility makes a variety 
      of dead blow hammers.     

288
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:49,975
       some are soft-faced      

289
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:53,711
    and some are ball-peens,    
  which are used by machinists. 

290
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,446
 all in all, they come in handy 

291
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,982
           everywhere           
     from nascar racetracks     

292
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,785
       to operating rooms.      

293
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:04,990
  to first create the internal  
    structure of the hammer,    

294
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:08,126
   they drill through a short   
  length of welded steel tubing 

295
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,727
       with a drill press.      

296
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,730
        the worker drills       
   straight through the tube,   

297
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,398
 creating a hole on both sides. 

298
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,869
      this tube will become     
the internal head of the hammer.

299
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,940
    the head needs a handle.    

300
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:25,410
    a worker places the tube    
            on a jig            

301
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,412
    and then positions a rod    
          on the hole.          

302
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:31,882
     a press forces the rod     
        through the tube.       

303
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,151
      at the next station,      

304
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,220
         a worker places        
 the internal hammer assemblage 

305
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:39,491
  behind a pane of tinted glass 
       to protect her eyes      

306
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,760
          as she welds          
  the head and handle together. 

307
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,696
         she only welds         
       the top of the tube      

308
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,264
  so as not to alter the metal. 

309
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:53,504
 a machine drills a set of small
 conical indents in the handle. 

310
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,107
      fitting a set of pins     
        inside the mold,        

311
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,978
  these indents will be crucial 
         to the process.        

312
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,114
   because the internal handle  
            is round,           

313
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,583
      the urethane exterior     
        could twist on it       

314
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,252
 when the hammer is being used. 

315
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:11,589
        to prevent this,        
  a worker welds on a flat tab. 

316
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,326
 the urethane will lock in place
         around the tab.        

317
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,463
      next, a worker crimps     
           a metal cap          

318
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,266
     on one end of the tube.    

319
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,403
 this creates an open canister, 

320
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,406
which the worker partially fills
  with a crucial ingredient --  

321
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,808
      hardened steel shot.      

322
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,478
      he then crimps a cap      
        on the open end,        

323
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
      sealing in the shot.      

324
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,348
  with the head canister done,  

325
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,952
the core of the dead blow hammer
        is now complete.        

326
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,288
   while the basic components   
           are simple,          

327
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,892
      workers must assemble     
  every element with precision. 

328
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,761
          the mold has          
    a set of pins inside it.    

329
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,030
   a worker aligns the indents  
       on the metal handle      

330
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,231
        with these pins.        

331
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,236
      the pins ensure that      
    the internal hammer hangs   

332
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:01,973
in a perfectly centered position
        inside the mold.        

333
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,975
     workers secure the mold    
       in a support frame       

334
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,245
 before placing it on a conveyor

335
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,548
    that will take it through   
       a preheating oven.       

336
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,919
        ball-peen hammers       
   are assembled differently.   

337
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,055
  instead of crimping a cap on, 

338
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:20,458
     they screw the face of     
the hammer onto a threaded tube.

339
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,194
 the metal core of the ball-peen
       is placed in a mold      

340
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,197
   that leaves the metal face   
        and ball exposed.       

341
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,135
         after the molds        
    go through the preheater,   

342
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,604
           they arrive          
     at the filling station.    

343
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,872
      a high-speed mix head     

344
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:38,008
         blends urethane        
  with hardeners and catalysts  

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,146
        and pumps the mix       
    through a flexible hose.    

346
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,681
     a worker uses the hose     

347
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,018
  to fill the molds to the brim 
     with the orange fluid.     

348
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,887
       she then sends them      
         into the oven,         

349
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,623
       where they'll spend      
        30 minutes curing       

350
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:55,760
at about 300 degrees fahrenheit.

351
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,895
 on the other side of the oven, 

352
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,965
   a worker removes the molds   
        from their frames       

353
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,968
        and then releases       
    the newly formed hammers.   

354
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
             thanks             
   to a special release agent   

355
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,439
        that was sprayed        
        inside the mold,        

356
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,577
  the hammers come out easily.  

357
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,579
    at the finishing station,   

358
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,115
           workers use          
   a high-speed circular brush  

359
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,317
 to remove the excess material, 
            or flash,           

360
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,721
produced by the molding process.

361
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,789
             this is            
  the most difficult operation  

362
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,791
          in the making         
      of dead blow hammers,     

363
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:30,061
        and these workers       
       are highly skilled.      

364
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,999
 when molding ball-peen hammers,

365
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:38,470
 the front and back of the head 
        are left exposed.       

366
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:42,606
    for performance reasons,    
  this steel is not stainless.  

367
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,744
  workers dip the exposed steel 
           in hot wax.          

368
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,413
  the wax coating will protect  
      the hammer from rust      

369
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,551
      until it's taken off      
 the store shelf and put to use.

370
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,953
      soft-faced ball-peens     
           and sledges          

371
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,223
     are among the 20 models    
      of dead blow hammers
