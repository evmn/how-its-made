 narrator: a commercial drone is
   a small, unmanned aircraft   

5
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,057
     with an onboard camera     

6
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,992
it can capture a bird's-eye view
         of the ground,         

7
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,729
   collecting up-to-the-minute  
   data useful for many types   

8
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,330
        of applications.        

9
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,533
      they're used to plan      
    infrastructure projects,    

10
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:13,205
  overseeing natural resources, 
       or manage farmland.      

11
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,474
    spanning about five feet    
     and a half in diameter,    

12
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,744
      this commercial drone     
    is known as an octocopter   

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,681
      it has eight rotors,      
   which enable it to maneuver  

14
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,083
  in the air like a helicopter. 

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,153
     the drone's components     
    are made of carbon fiber,   

16
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,089
         a highly stiff,        
  strong, and durable material  

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,492
      carbon fiber is also      
          lightweight,          

18
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:36,028
 a critical factor in aviation. 

19
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,097
     computer-guided milling    
     machine cuts the parts.    

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,235
      a technician manually     
    sands their edges smooth.   

21
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,905
  this component is half of one 
      of the drone's legs.      

22
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,374
 the mill also cuts out the top 
        and bottom frames       

23
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,643
      for the drone's body.     

24
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,981
    technicians then assemble   
   the two halves of each leg.  

25
00:01:55,983 --> 00:02:01,453
 some of the drone's components 
 are produced by a 3-d printer, 

26
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,456
  the printer builds each part  
         layer by layer         

27
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,526
out of a thin stream of plastic.

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,662
   this is one of the drone's   
     eight arm receptacles.     

29
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,769
   a technician bores the hole  
  where the arm will be fitted. 

30
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:26,211
    the hole must be precise    
     to ensure a secure fit.    

31
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,747
  after verifying its diameter  
     with digital calipers,     

32
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,483
         the technician         
     installs the back part     

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,418
 of the receptacle and the lever

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,556
  that clamps the inserted arm  
        firmly in place.        

35
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,227
 he attaches an electronic speed
     controller to one end.     

36
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,761
 then, he screws the receptacle 

37
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,232
       to the bottom frame      
      of the drone's body.      

38
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,102
      the wires coming out      
 the other end of the controller

39
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:53,539
 connect to an electrical power 
  harness and to the autopilot. 

40
00:02:55,042 --> 00:03:00,379
  the autopilot is the onboard  
  computer that runs the drone. 

41
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:06,451
           he installs          
the seven remaining receptacles,

42
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,220
     then the power harness.    

43
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,126
    it has eight connectors,    

44
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,895
     one for each electronic    
        speed controller.       

45
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,834
next, he attaches the top frame,

46
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:30,475
   then the payload mount that  
holds the camera and hard drive.

47
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,679
   he links the payload mount   
       to this servomotor,      

48
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:37,349
         which is guided        
        by the autopilot.       

49
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:40,285
        the drone's body        
    is protected by a cover.    

50
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:45,157
workers mount a sheet of plastic
   on a vacuum former machine.  

51
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,294
          they start up         
  the machine's heating element 

52
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,764
    and position the plastic    
        just beneath it.        

53
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:58,303
this gradually heats the plastic
      to a malleable state.     

54
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,172
    once the plastic is soft,   

55
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:05,310
   they position a wooden mold  
         on the machine,        

56
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,313
      activate the suction,     

57
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:12,184
       then drop the sheet      
         onto the mold.         

58
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,520
  the vacuum draws the plastic  
       tightly against it.      

59
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:23,128
   they let the vacuum-formed   
   plastic to cool and harden,  

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,231
         then carefully         
       trim off the excess      

61
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,674
  they cut out a rough opening  
      for the payload mount     

62
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,210
      through that opening,     
      they secure the cover     

63
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,478
     to the computer-guided     
        milling machine,        

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,716
    which finalizes the shape   
   to precise specifications.   

65
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,224
   once the cover is finished,  

66
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,493
         they install it        
        on the top frame.       

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,801
    they attach the four legs   
      to the bottom frame.      

68
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:08,573
  then, they install the camera 
    on to the payload mount.    

69
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,910
    the mount pivots to angle   
    the camera at the ground.   

70
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,848
 they insert and clamp the arms 
      into the receptacles.     

71
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,052
 each arm is a carbon fiber tube
      with a plastic rotor      

72
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,855
          that's driven         
  by a small motor underneath.  

73
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,124
upon inserting an arm, its motor

74
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,728
       makes contact with       
its electronic speed controller.

75
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,530
they also install the autopilot,

76
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,533
     the autopilot executes     
   the programmed flight path   

77
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,935
    and operates the camera,    

78
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,337
         the servomotor         
     that moves the payload,    

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,006
       and the electronic       
       speed controllers.       

80
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,543
       the drone operator       
   can communicate wirelessly   

81
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,345
       with the autopilot       
     using a remote control.    

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,214
      but it's more common      
 to program the gps coordinates 

83
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:54,219
      of the drone's route      
        prior to takeoff.       

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:06,832
  narrator: aquariums have been 
  around for hundreds of years. 

85
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,099
     even now, having a body    

86
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,037
     of water in a glass box    
        seems like magic.       

87
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,906
    the most common aquarium    
      fish is the goldfish,     

88
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,276
      domesticated in china     
   more than 1,000 years ago.   

89
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,650
       goldfish are a type      
     of carp native to asia.    

90
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,985
         they tend to be        
    silver or gray in color.    

91
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,188
  but ancient chinese breeders  

92
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,724
    took advantage of orange    
      and yellow mutations      

93
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,862
  to breed a gold-colored fish. 

94
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,332
like all fish, aquarium goldfish
       start life as eggs.      

95
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,468
 to start the breeding process, 

96
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,638
  a worker separates the males  
        from the females.       

97
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,744
        telling the girls       
 from the boys can be difficult.

98
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,547
     but if she finds eggs,     
      there's no question.      

99
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,349
       it must be female.       

100
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,427
  the eggs fall to the bottom.  

101
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,532
  this facility harvests around 
        1,000 eggs a day.       

102
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,369
          adding oxygen         
     helps the eggs mature.     

103
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,205
  a week later, the eggs hatch. 

104
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,544
 the hatchlings are called fry. 

105
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,146
       by the second week,      
      they're little fish.      

106
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,584
       not all of them are      
    the typical orange color    

107
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,255
      even after centuries      
          of breeding,          

108
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,292
     many of them are still     
        silver and gray.        

109
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,264
  as the fry increase in size,  
   workers must transfer them   

110
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,935
          from buckets          
    to larger holding tanks.    

111
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:55,206
    this facility sells fish    
 at different stages of growth. 

112
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,812
     here, a worker selects     
   a particular size to sell.   

113
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,415
   once the selection process   
          is complete,          

114
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:08,620
 she transfers the selected fish
  to a bag for transportation.  

115
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,356
    she adds air so the fish    
     will have enough oxygen    

116
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,124
        during transport.       

117
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:19,030
    a worker tosses dry food    
     into a series of ponds.    

118
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,900
          each pond is          
     roughly 100 square feet    

119
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,170
    and holds about 500 fish.   

120
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,273
 the food provides the nutrients
       needed for growth.       

121
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,778
 a worker checks the fish tanks 
      for signs of illness,     

122
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,281
  such as parasites or fungus.  

123
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,384
    he carefully portions out   
        and adds a liquid       

124
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,722
    known as methylene blue.    

125
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,657
 it's an anti-fungal treatment. 

126
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,061
      these 1-year-old fish     

127
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,632
      are a different type      
      of carp known as koi.     

128
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,400
  koi were first bred in japan  

129
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,903
         for their color        
     and pattern variations.    

130
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,208
        a worker isolates       
        a quantity of koi       

131
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,344
    with a specially designed   
          shallow net.          

132
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,949
    this allows her to select   
      the right-sized fish      

133
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,617
        to bag for sale.        

134
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,158
      the bagged fish await     
    transport to the market.    

135
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,964
  it's time to prepare the bags 
    of goldfish for shipping.   

136
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,565
a worker empties a batch of them

137
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,035
         into a netting         
       suspended in water.      

138
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,839
     a team of workers sort     
      through the goldfish.     

139
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,776
      they select the fish      
   that meet the size criteria  

140
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,079
         and use spoons         
  to transfer them to a bucket. 

141
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,651
  to prepare fish for shipment, 

142
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:50,322
        workers dip them        
      in a green solution.      

143
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,724
      they then rinse them      
         in clear water         

144
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,260
   before bagging them again.   

145
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,995
   the green solution contains  

146
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,197
           a specially          
      calibrated medication     

147
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,367
    that helps reduce stress    
        during transport.       

148
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,338
         next, a worker         
      adds air to the bag,      

149
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,807
        ensuring the fish       
      have plenty of oxygen     

150
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,877
         while en route.        

151
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,880
       the fish have been       
  double bagged for protection. 

152
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,686
  a second worker squeezes out  
       some of the oxygen       

153
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,289
    so the bag won't take up    
         too much room,         

154
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,993
       then seals the top       
         of both layers.        

155
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:35,767
  a packer carefully loads four 
   bags into a styrofoam box.   

156
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,838
 the box provides a rigid casing
       to protect the fish      

157
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,641
      while insulating them     
against temperature fluctuations

158
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,576
        during transport.       

159
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,513
    this facility also sells    
         whole aquariums        

160
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,915
  already populated with fish.  

161
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,451
        a worker inspects       
       a row of aquariums,      

162
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,987
       assessing the size       
     and quality of the fish    

163
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,657
       while checking for       
      any signs of disease.     

164
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,394
       the facility sells       
       50,000 fish a week,      

165
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,364
  or to two million every year. 

166
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,275
  narrator: when a plane lands, 
      the tires burn rubber     

167
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,943
  that melts into the pavement. 

168
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,013
    this can make the runway    
         slick when wet.        

169
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,683
special cleaning machines ensure
 that the runway is always clean

170
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,285
          and clear for         
      takeoff and landing.      

171
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,354
         they blast off         
       the rubber streaks,      

172
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,525
          then suction          
   the rubber bits into tanks.  

173
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,230
    a runway-cleaning machine   
   is a serious power washer.   

174
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:43,168
    it pressurizes hot water    
 to at least 20 times the force 

175
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
  of the average power washer.  

176
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,972
         the spray heads        
    are designed specifically   

177
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,641
        for blasting away       
      aircraft tire rubber      

178
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,645
       that's melted into       
       airstrip pavement.       

179
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,582
      they ensure airports      
    are a safe place to land.   

180
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,586
        making one starts       
    with the hydraulic motors   

181
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,922
     that spin the sprayers.    

182
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,857
  a technician inserts a shaft  

183
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,993
  that will hold the spray bar  
       into a motor unit.       

184
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,262
  he installs sealing cylinders 

185
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,331
    to prevent hydraulic oils   
          from leaking.         

186
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,868
      he tops the assembly      
       with a metal plate.      

187
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,004
   the plate serves as a base   
      for thrust bearings,      

188
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,840
     which he installs next.    

189
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,612
      ceiling caps complete     
  the thrust bearing assembly.  

190
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,349
 a computerized test system now 
   measures the motor's torque  

191
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,018
          and the flow          
      of hydraulic fluids.      

192
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,353
         the system also        
       simulates the force      

193
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,289
 of the highly pressurized water

194
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,357
         to confirm that        
       the thrust bearings      

195
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,961
   will keep the motor stable.  

196
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,431
    a powerful water-jet tool   
      carves through steel      

197
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,433
    to produce the components   
           for the arm          

198
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,204
      that holds the runway     
     cleaner's spray heads.     

199
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,210
       a worker then fits       
   the steel plates together.   

200
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,719
       he welds the seams       
   to create permanent bonds.   

201
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,688
       and this completes       
   the stray arm's structure.   

202
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,660
     after the arm has been     
    sandblasted and painted,    

203
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,930
   they hoist it to the front   
  of the runway-cleaning truck. 

204
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,638
   they attach it with large,   
    zinc-coated steel bolts.    

205
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,875
      a worker then mounts      
        hydraulic motors        

206
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,111
   to a long, wheeled bracket.  

207
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,617
   he removed the sealing caps  
    before this installation    

208
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,219
       to make it easier.       

209
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,557
    once the motors have been   
     secured to the bracket,    

210
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,459
      he replaces the caps.     

211
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,568
 he attaches the wheeled bracket
        to the spray arm        

212
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,772
   and installs metal shrouds   
        for the sprayers.       

213
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,706
        they have fringes       
        of nylon bristles       

214
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,508
      to contain the spray.     

215
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,377
   he fastens rotating sealers  

216
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,512
    to the hole in the center   
         of each shroud         

217
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,981
   to keep out dirt and water.  

218
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,517
    he screws the spray bars    

219
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,320
       to the shafts that       
     extend from the motors.    

220
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:19,324
      the nozzles are made      
  of sapphire, a tough mineral  

221
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,393
  that can withstand the force  
    of the pressurized spray.   

222
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,931
      the next worker runs      
   vacuum hoses to the shrouds  

223
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,268
     and connects them using    
    cam and groove couplings.   

224
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,707
     the sprayer assemblies     
        are now complete.       

225
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,677
 the team lowers a large gearbox

226
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,146
     between the frame rails    
          of the truck.         

227
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,215
   they bolt it to the rails.   

228
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,022
this gearbox will transfer power
      from the truck engine     

229
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,625
     to a high-pressure pump    
         and the vacuum.        

230
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,231
   the pump and vacuum systems  

231
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,234
       have been assembled      
      into one big module.      

232
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,436
          a technician          
    tests the belt and pulley   

233
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,706
        that will connect       
         to the gearbox.        

234
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,374
  it's in good, working order,  

235
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,509
    so they cover the system    
        with steel casing       

236
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,713
       for safety reasons.      

237
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,515
      this module is ready      
         to be assembled        

238
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,984
  to the runway cleaner truck.  

239
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:25,623
it weighs 2 1/2 tons, so a crane
     does the heavy lifting.    

240
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:33,598
    workers then build a tank   
   that's as tall as they are.  

241
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,733
     this tank will contain     
         the rubber bits        

242
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,535
    vacuumed off the runway,    

243
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,072
    along with the water used   
    in the cleaning process.    

244
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,606
     once it's been painted,    

245
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:47,211
 they assemble it to the chassis
 next to the clean water tanks. 

246
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,814
  moving inside the truck cab,  
        a worker installs       

247
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,350
     controls for the runway    
      cleaner's operation.      

248
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,219
   one console has a joystick   

249
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,155
  for manipulating the position 
       of the spray heads.      

250
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,824
         other switches         
      are for the operation     

251
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,760
  of the water pump and vacuum. 

252
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,097
runway cleaners can also be used
     to erase painted lines     

253
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:10,101
       when landing strips      
    need to be reconfigured.    

254
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,637
   just adjust the nozzle size  
       and forward speed,       

255
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,409
  and, like the rubber streaks, 
      the lines disappear.      

256
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,919
   narrator: people have been   
          playing games         

257
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,254
with shuttlecocks for millennia.

258
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,123
    in the mid-19th century,    

259
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,858
       the british created      
       the game badminton,      

260
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,527
        in which players        
        hit a shuttlecock       

261
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,862
   back and forth over a net.   

262
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,132
   made of feathers and cork,   
         the shuttlecock        

263
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,902
       predates badminton       
     by thousands of years.     

264
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,406
    many people are familiar    
  with the plastic shuttlecocks 

265
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,945
    used for badminton games    
    in backyards everywhere.    

266
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,613
       but serious players      

267
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,416
        use the original        
     feathered shuttlecock.     

268
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:04,756
this facility uses duck feathers
  to build their shuttlecocks.  

269
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,693
 workers start by aligning them 
    with the feather side up    

270
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,094
    and storing them in cups    

271
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,164
       in preparation for       
  the next phase of production. 

272
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,568
   having the feathers aligned  
         makes it easier        

273
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,171
      for a worker to feed      
        them, one by one,       

274
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,173
       into a specialized       
        sorting machine.        

275
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,644
         this device has        
      26 different sensors      

276
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,047
   that measure each feather.   

277
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,518
      the feathers must be      
         a specific size        

278
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,220
    and have a precise angle.   

279
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,591
   the machine sorts feathers   

280
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,062
   of the same size and angle   
      into different bins.      

281
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,732
     sometimes, the sensors     

282
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,134
      are unable to measure     
        certain feathers,       

283
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,936
       those feathers fall      
      into a separate bin.      

284
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:57,275
  a worker uses a special chart 
    to measure them by hand.    

285
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,281
 the tips of these shuttlecocks 
        are made of cork        

286
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,085
       and synthetic foam       
   covered with white leather.  

287
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,691
       it's time to start       
  assembling the shuttlecocks.  

288
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,693
        each shuttlecock        
        has 16 feathers,        

289
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,097
        which must all be       
   precisely the same length.   

290
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,168
      the punching machine      
  begins the assembly process.  

291
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,637
 it starts by punching 16 holes 

292
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,374
        in the perimeter        
     of the shuttlecock tip.    

293
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,044
 the worker feeding the feathers
         into the device        

294
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,481
         must keep pace         
        with the machine.       

295
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,857
 a worker uses flat-nose pliers 

296
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,927
       to adjust the angle      
        of each feather.        

297
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,664
she then places the shuttlecocks
 inside a miniature wind tunnel 

298
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,467
        to see if they're       
       properly balanced.       

299
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,271
      on some shuttlecocks,     
     each feather might have    

300
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,642
   a slightly different angle   
      to maximize balance.      

301
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,012
 once the angle of the feathers 
       has been adjusted,       

302
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,349
they're transferred to a machine
   that applies a bead of glue  

303
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,553
  around the interior perimeter 
     of the shuttlecock tip.    

304
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,091
          this secures          
     the feathers in place.     

305
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,630
      to further stabilize      
          the feathers,         

306
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,634
      workers place them in     
  a specialized sewing machine  

307
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,769
         that binds them        
        securely together       

308
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,838
    with two rows of thread.    

309
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,644
       the threads stitch       
    each feather to the next.   

310
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,713
          this process          
  strengthens the shuttlecocks, 

311
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,514
      helping them maintain     
           their shape          

312
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,850
    even when they're getting   
     slammed back and forth     

313
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,786
           over a net.          

314
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,926
  when the machine has finished 
    stitching a shuttlecock,    

315
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,996
  a worker ties off the thread  
   to keep it from unraveling   

316
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,365
    and cuts off the excess.    

317
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,636
     finally, she evens out     
        the thread rows.        

318
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,405
   with the threads in place,   

319
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,009
      the shuttlecocks must     
     undergo a final tuning.    

320
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,011
       a worker once again      
      adjusts the feathers      

321
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,447
    to ensure proper balance.   

322
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,618
     a machine applies glue     
         to the threads         

323
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,287
       on the shuttlecock,      
      locking them in place     

324
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,423
          to give them          
     the necessary rigidity.    

325
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,794
      the thread is made to     
      quickly absorb glue.      

326
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,632
 a worker applies a green strip,

327
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,968
         which indicates        
    a slow-speed shuttlecock.   

328
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,038
    medium-speed shuttlecocks   
        get a blue strip.       

329
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,140
       fast ones are red.       

330
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,312
          it's time for         
    quality-control testing.    

331
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,182
       a machine equipped       
     with a racket-like arm     

332
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:55,853
     fires the shuttlecocks     
      to a waiting worker.      

333
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,389
        shuttlecocks can        
        travel at speeds        

334
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,324
  as high as 300 feet a second. 

335
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,128
     that's twice as fast as    
 a pitcher can throw a baseball.

336
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,735
   once the shuttlecocks have   
passed the quality-control test,

337
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,936
  a worker inserts 12 at a time 

338
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,138
    into long cardboard tubes   

339
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,875
      similar to those used     
      to hold tennis balls.     

340
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,348
      with its 16 feathers,     
         it's no wonder         

341
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,584
     the shuttlecock is also    
       known as a birdie.       

342
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,422
   these high-quality products  
        are ready to fly.
