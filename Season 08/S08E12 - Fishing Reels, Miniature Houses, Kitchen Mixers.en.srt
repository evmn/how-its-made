00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,758
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,227
       manhole covers....       

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,999
        ...range hoods...       

6
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,605
      ...artificial logs...     

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,611
       ...and snowmobiles.      

8
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,986
         manhole covers         
      are those metal lids      

9
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,322
      on maintenance holes      
          and roadways.         

10
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,992
   workers lift them to enter   
        and repair sewers       

11
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,860
and other underground utilities.

12
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,063
    foundries make the covers   
   out of heavy-duty cast iron  

13
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,532
    so they last for decades    

14
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,768
         and don't budge        
     under passing traffic.     

15
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,945
       this company makes       
       hundreds of models       

16
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,480
 of manhole covers and collars, 

17
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,681
       the rims upon which      
         the covers sit.        

18
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,285
     they come in two types     
     of cast-iron alloy --      

19
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,421
   either ductile iron, which   
 has magnesium to reinforce it, 

20
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,292
 or gray iron, which is heavier 
       but just as strong.      

21
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,231
        to make a cover,        
 they first have to make a mold.

22
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,503
this one's got the design of the
cover's top side carved into it.

23
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,438
         workers pour in        
    about 650 pounds of sand    

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,042
 mixed with glue and a hardener.

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,180
 for the underset of the cover, 

26
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,983
      they repeat the step      
        in another mold.        

27
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,456
   a worker creates a channel   
        in the sand mold        

28
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,091
   through which they'll pour   
        the molten metal.       

29
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,194
        he plugs the hole       
       with a wooden block      

30
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,563
 to preserve the cavity beneath.

31
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,203
      he removes the block      
 and briefly reinserts the pipe 

32
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,007
      to ensure the cavity      
        hasn't caved in.        

33
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:26,245
    it takes about 15 minutes   
   for the sand mix to harden.  

34
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,018
 a machine then inverts each box

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,754
          and vibrates          
     to shake out the mold.     

36
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,095
   to make one manhole cover,   

37
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,366
     workers will join molds    
 of the top and bottom sections.

38
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,034
         alignment lugs         
  and glue between the sections 

39
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,370
    help them align properly    

40
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,507
    and form an airtight seal   
 so molten metal won't leak out.

41
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,379
        next, the machine       
     flips the bottom mold,     

42
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,582
       moves the top mold       
      into position below,      

43
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,251
      then mates the pair.      

44
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,123
  the factory buys scrap metal  
      from demolition sites     

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,191
   and also recycles its own.   

46
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,394
     it'll melt these metals    
      with certain minerals     

47
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,128
       to enhance the mix.      

48
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,197
 graphite to make it malleable, 

49
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,668
  silicon to make it stronger,  
          and magnesium         

50
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,971
  to make this batch of ductile 
  iron lightweight yet strong.  

51
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,474
      here, a giant magnet      

52
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,744
picks up chunks of recycled iron
           and steel.           

53
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,483
     the metal is preheated     
    to 780 degrees fahrenheit   

54
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,285
 then transferred to a furnace. 

55
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,487
     there, at 2,700 degrees    
           fahrenheit,          

56
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,357
   it takes about a half hour   
      to melt enough metal      

57
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,260
       to make 35 covers.       

58
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,434
      workers then transfer     
 the molten metal to a cauldron 

59
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,968
      and add more silicon.     

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,706
 this evens out the consistency 
     so it's easier to pour.    

61
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,181
       besides the channel      
    for pouring in the metal,   

62
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,449
        some larger molds       
         have vent holes        

63
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,418
   to evacuate burning gasses.  

64
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,990
            it takes            
    about an hour and a half    

65
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,992
    for the metal to harden.    

66
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,928
 a conveyor then drops the molds
        into a container        

67
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,098
      and breaks them open.     

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,137
          using a hook,         
    they pick up the casting.   

69
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,874
       this one's a collar      
   weighing about 220 pounds.   

70
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,610
  they knock off the remaining  
          bits of sand          

71
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,747
    and excess bits of metal    
 that formed during the casting.

72
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:47,085
    these scraps get recycled   
    into a new batch of iron.   

73
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,891
   manhole covers vary in size  

74
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,761
          according to          
   the specifications ordered.  

75
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:58,997
  most are roughly the diameter 
         of a car tire.         

76
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,668
       the average weight       
      is about 140 pounds.      

77
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,572
    a worker now smoothes out   
    the edges of the collar,    

78
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,841
     and then the perimeter     
          of the cover.         

79
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,978
   this way, it will sit flush  
         on the collar.         

80
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,853
       this machine tests       
    the strength of the cover   

81
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,321
      by applying pressure.     

82
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,259
  it must withstand the weight  
of a car on every one-inch area.

83
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,995
      they paint the covers     
           and collars          

84
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,531
         by dipping them        
     in a bath of black tar.    

85
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,601
      once dry, the pieces      
  have a rust-resistant finish  

86
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,470
     that lasts for decades.    

87
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,406
         and the buyers         
      expect them to last,      

88
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,711
     because a manhole cover    
  and collar cost up to $1,400. 

89
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,259
  narrator: people have cooked  
  on stovetops for centuries,   

90
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,027
 but it wasn't until about 1800 

91
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,631
  that metal stoves with flues  
vented steam and smoke outdoors.

92
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,900
        today, factories        
        make encased fans       

93
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,170
    that powerfully ventilate   
  and also light the stovetop.  

94
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,372
           a stovetop           
   is often called a "range,"   

95
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,842
  hence the name "range hoods." 

96
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,183
  no matter how well you cook,  
 steam and smoke are inevitable.

97
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,519
          fortunately,          
      the range hood's fan,     

98
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,589
       called the blower,       
   clears the air in seconds.   

99
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,326
     production begins with     
  this computer-guided machine. 

100
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,127
           it cuts out          
   a sheet of galvanized steel  

101
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,430
          to make part          
     of the hood's housing.     

102
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,539
         a 300-ton press        
    then perforates the sheet   

103
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,007
 and cuts out up to 50 openings 

104
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,411
      for screws, wiring,       
      and exhaust outlets.      

105
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,881
 a worker inserts another panel 
         for the housing        

106
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,550
       in a 25-ton press.       

107
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,619
   the machine bends the steel  
         in two places.         

108
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,422
   they'll use this component   
   to make a circular channel   

109
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,957
 that evacuates smoke and steam 

110
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,126
       that often contain       
       grease particles.        

111
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,766
       to curl the panel,       

112
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,236
 the worker uses another machine
       with three rollers.      

113
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,037
  it forms the circular channel 

114
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,809
 that fits around the blower to 
 direct air through the exhaust.

115
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,978
   here a spot-welding machine  

116
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,581
        joins two corners       
     of the hood's housing.     

117
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,383
 this is mainly for aesthetics. 

118
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,985
       a weld looks better      
      than a screw or bolt.     

119
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,193
        this 80-ton press       
     bends the hood's shell,    

120
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,264
making one of 80 folds that give
 the component its final shape. 

121
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,273
          now a worker          
   removes the plastic coating  

122
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,076
    that protected the steel    
       during the cutting.      

123
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,546
      he applies a sticker      
    with a product i.d. code.   

124
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,284
   then a pad printing machine  
      marks the brand name,     

125
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,754
 1 of 12 this factory produces. 

126
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:13,358
this is the first of eight stops
      on an assembly line.      

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,427
 a worker installs a transformer

128
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:19,331
   to power the blower's motor  
     and two halogen lights.    

129
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,704
       this circuit board       
  regulates several functions,  

130
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,505
            including           
     three light intensities    

131
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,341
        and the blower's        
        four-speed motor.       

132
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,913
    she attaches the board to   
 the housing with three screws. 

133
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,555
   this panel has lights that   
 indicate what functions are on.

134
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,125
    next, the worker installs   

135
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,262
          the blower's          
    165-watt electric motor.    

136
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,864
       the motor attaches       
       with three screws        

137
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,134
      into rubber bushings      
      that reduce noise...      

138
00:08:56,136 --> 00:09:00,238
    then, light sockets made    
   of heat-resistant plastic.   

139
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:08,747
   the blower's housing snaps   
  into place around the motor.  

140
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,749
a little silicone on the housing

141
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,685
    ensures an airtight seal    
       around the blower.       

142
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,755
        then she installs       
        the blower wheel.       

143
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,825
         next, she plugs        
   the lights in to test them.  

144
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,762
      you press this button     
           three times          

145
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,764
       to make the lights       
      increasingly bright.      

146
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,103
       there's one button       
 for each of the motor's speeds.

147
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,776
    after snapping a panel on   
  to enclose the hood assembly, 

148
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,978
a worker attaches a plastic ring

149
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,514
          to direct air         
       through the blower.      

150
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,918
        a computer system       
  tracks each model's assembly. 

151
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,755
 when workers complete a step,  
 they input it into the system. 

152
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,057
       an optical scanner       

153
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:56,127
  also senses when they remove  
  a part from 1 of 25 cubbies,  

154
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,065
like these removable air filters
     made of mesh aluminum.     

155
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,002
      the tracking system's     
      called "polka yoke,"      

156
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,338
   a japanese-inspired method   
 that insures thorough assembly.

157
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,806
      it follows each model     

158
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,277
     until workers place it     
     in a box for shipping.     

159
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,086
     the system's final task    
          is to ensure          

160
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,556
        that they put in        
   the mail-in guarantee card   

161
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,024
  and the installation manual.  

162
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,360
   if workers forget anything,  

163
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:33,164
     the system reminds them    
       with a loud buzzer.      

164
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,767
once they staple the box closed,

165
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,169
   a machine with suction cups  
           picks it up          

166
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,305
          and stacks it         
      10 boxes per pallet.      

167
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,179
          all this work         
 so you can stay in the kitchen 

168
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,715
     even if you can't stand    
            the heat.           

169
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,330
            narrator:           
in the mood to light a cozy fire

170
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,998
in your wood stove or fireplace?

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,933
        no need to put on       
       your coat and boots      

172
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,736
   and trudge through the snow  
    to the outdoor wood pile.   

173
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,606
      nowadays you can buy      
     a box of manmade logs.     

174
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,408
   a lot less hassle for you,   
        fewer trees die,        

175
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,478
     and the environmentally    
  friendly brands pollute less  

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,914
 and are safer for your chimney.

177
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,692
 these artificial logs are made 
 entirely of compressed sawdust.

178
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,495
     their moisture content     
        is less than 9%,        

179
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:41,332
         compared to 30%        
        in real firewood.       

180
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,907
         the compression        
       and dryness combine      

181
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,643
   to make these manmade logs   
 easier to light than real ones.

182
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,313
     they don't throw sparks    
         while burning,         

183
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,783
 and they produce 300% more heat
       than real firewood.      

184
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,853
      the high temperature      
   burns up the gasses better,  

185
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,656
        so the logs emit        
   up to 50% fewer pollutants,  

186
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,792
  and they produce fewer ashes  
     and far less creosote,     

187
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,126
     a highly flammable tar     

188
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,729
   that's a natural byproduct   
        of wood burning.        

189
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,033
    creosote buildup in a flu   
    can cause a chimney fire.   

190
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,280
  the sawdust comes from pure,  
        natural hardwood,       

191
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,682
      mostly oak and maple.     

192
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,885
         the log company        
     buys it from factories     

193
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,420
  that make hardwood flooring.  

194
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,956
       so from the start,       
    these logs are ecological   

195
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,391
      because they're made      
       of recycled waste.       

196
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,832
      the sawdust is clean,     

197
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,834
       and the log factory      
     doesn't add chemicals,     

198
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,670
          so it's safe          
     to cook over the fire.     

199
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,844
  the sawdust moisture content  
            is so low           

200
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,181
  because the wood it came from 
 was already dried in huge ovens

201
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,216
      to make the flooring.     

202
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,927
       the sawdust arrives      
   in different consistencies,  

203
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,596
        so the first step       
 is to put it through a grinder 

204
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:22,267
      to make the particles     
        uniform in size.        

205
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,407
 the next step is the key one --
          compression.          

206
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,276
    at a rate of 5,500 pounds   
            per hour,           

207
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,546
  an air-blowing system moves   
  the sawdust from the grinder  

208
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,050
          directly into         
     a compression machine.     

209
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:45,156
the machine is a giant cylinder 
with a piston that moves inside.

210
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,958
           the piston           
     compresses the sawdust     

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,329
 using extreme high pressure -- 
 6,000 pounds per square inch.  

212
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,835
  the result is a 40-foot-long  
     compressed sawdust log.    

213
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,704
    unlike some other brands    
       of artificial logs,      

214
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,039
        this one contains       
        no binding agents       

215
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,008
   which can pollute the air.   

216
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,713
     so how does the sawdust    
      stick together, then?     

217
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,182
           the secret           
    is the high compression.    

218
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,717
   the intense heat it creates  

219
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,453
    bonds the natural resins    
         in the sawdust.        

220
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,256
        as the log exits        
    the compression machine,    

221
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,659
  a cutter shapes a flat edge.  

222
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,794
    this is a safety feature.   

223
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,997
 with a flat edge on the bottom,
  the logs are easier to stack  

224
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,333
       in the recommended       
    three-log configuration,    

225
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,070
       and they don't roll      
        out of position.        

226
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,816
        now, a guillotine       
      chops the 40-foot log     

227
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,886
      into 40 smaller logs,     
        each 1 foot long.       

228
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,760
  a separator pulls them apart. 

229
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:02,099
    the company also produces   
         a 10-inch log.         

230
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,636
          the logs drop         
      onto a conveyor belt      

231
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,373
          that leads to         
       the packaging area.      

232
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,127
   the factory boxes its logs   

233
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,995
        with instructions       
     and two fire starters.     

234
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,532
      the starters are made     
   of sawdust and candle wax,   

235
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:38,770
    more effective than using   
newspaper to get the fire going.

236
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,941
this competitor's artificial log
          breaks easily         

237
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,810
   because it isn't as dense.   

238
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,546
       this company's log,      
       on the other hand,       

239
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,749
      is more solid because     
   it's so tightly compressed.  

240
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,085
  that high density translates  
     into more burning time.    

241
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,488
      three logs will keep      
      your fireplace alight     

242
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,791
     for about three hours.     

243
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,436
    narrator: for centuries,    
inventors tackled this challenge

244
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,638
       with determination       
        and frustration.        

245
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,172
     the first snow machines    

246
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,042
     trudged through winters    
      awkwardly and slowly.     

247
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,710
     but by the late 1950s,     

248
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,713
        new technologies        
      and materials emerged     

249
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,183
 to make snowmobiles that could 
     blaze through the snow     

250
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,152
      with increasing ease      
          and comfort.          

251
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,657
     snowmobilers often face    
         rugged terrain.        

252
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,260
           snowmobiles          
     need a rock-solid build    

253
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,997
        to keep the rider       
      safe and comfortable.     

254
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,666
          it all begins         
  with an aluminum-alloy frame. 

255
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,803
    the pieces arrive partly    
   assembled to the radiator.   

256
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,073
         the robot spins        
    and positions the frame.    

257
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,410
  a computer-guided frame-rivet 
      machine punches holes     

258
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,680
and inserts rivets directly into
the frame with great precision. 

259
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,753
  this process bonds the parts  
 tightly so they can't vibrate. 

260
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,627
 next comes the rear suspension,

261
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,430
    aimed at making the ride    
     as smooth as possible.     

262
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,967
  inserting this plastic slide  
         onto the runner        

263
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,303
   minimizes friction between   
  the track and the suspension. 

264
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,372
     a conveyor belt carries    
      the suspension system     

265
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,374
    through several stations.   

266
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,512
 wheels and sprockets will turn 
 the track that grips the snow. 

267
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,449
       the suspension kit       
     with springs and coils     

268
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,451
 goes directly into the runners.

269
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,920
           along with           
     these shock absorbers,     

270
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,456
 the suspension will fit snugly 
  into the snowmobile's frame.  

271
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,193
   workers tighten everything   
        manually for now.       

272
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:46,396
        later, a machine        
 will tighten things even more. 

273
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,332
           assembling           
     the transmission system    

274
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,001
             starts             
     with this countershaft.    

275
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,404
       first, they install      
  a high-performance brake disc 

276
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,506
      made of forged steel.     

277
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,679
         the chain case         
       fits snugly on top       

278
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,182
      thanks to the ridges      
          on this ring.         

279
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,019
  this die-cast aluminum casing 

280
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,055
      will house two gears      
          and a chain.          

281
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,094
 this bolt connects to a spring 

282
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,630
      that keeps the gears      
  and chain tight as they turn. 

283
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,032
       the chain-tightener      

284
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,500
       must slide smoothly      
  back and forth in its groove  

285
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,369
             to keep            
    the chain's tension even.   

286
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:29,573
this test checks that the spring
expands and compresses properly.

287
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,243
    now comes the oil gauge.    

288
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,711
     it's essential that oil    
 lubricate the parts thoroughly 

289
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,516
 because the motor will generate
       a lot of friction.       

290
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:42,120
        the transmission        
    fits on top of the frame.   

291
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,992
      these coils, springs,     
 runners, and wheels fit easily 

292
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,061
     into the rubber track.     

293
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:53,597
   the rear suspension system   
  connects to the track system  

294
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,132
           while this           
     white plastic sprocket     

295
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,668
       connects the track       
      to the transmission.      

296
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,474
    the speed sensor attaches   
    directly to the sprocket.   

297
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,421
   four high-grade steel bolts  

298
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,358
   anchor the rear suspension   
      system to the frame.      

299
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,892
        they're so strong       

300
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,894
       that the suspension      
  can withstand the vibrations  

301
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,030
   that come with high speeds.  

302
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,299
  now for the engine assembly.  

303
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,636
    bolts attach the electric   
 starter directly to the engine.

304
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,504
    the fuel-injected engine    
   generates a lot of heat --   

305
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,773
 up to 1,300 degrees fahrenheit.

306
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,110
     this shield has layers     
       of insulating wool       

307
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,712
   that act as a heat barrier   
      to protect the driver     

308
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,814
   from scorching-hot exhaust.  

309
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,120
          the engine's          
      made of cast aluminum     

310
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,722
   so it's relatively light --  
       just 100 pounds --       

311
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:56,260
  and it propels the snowmobile 
    up to 120 miles an hour.    

312
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,468
       now for the front        
       of the snowmobile.       

313
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,270
  this front suspension system  

314
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,807
  requires a different assembly 
       from the rear one.       

315
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,577
 a hoist brings it all together.

316
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,682
     the gas tank is made of    
   lightweight molded plastic   

317
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,950
       rather than metal.       

318
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,819
 the throttle controls the speed

319
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,022
 just like a gas pedal in a car.

320
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,692
          they install          
     the throttle assembly,     

321
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,662
         and a few more         
       functional details.      

322
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,571
       these lightweight,       
 aerodynamic plastic side panels

323
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,707
      give this snowmobile      
          a sleek look.         

324
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,050
    and now, the final step.    

325
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,186
     the zero-gravity hoist     
    lifts it all onto a skid.   

326
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,923
       polystyrene sheets       
     protect the snowmobile     

327
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,259
        during transport        
        to the retailer.        

328
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,261
     from start to finish,      
     it's taken three hours     

329
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,466
to assemble this showroom-ready,
    snow-travelling machine.
