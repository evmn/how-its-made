00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,788
  narrator: a dragster's tires  
     take quite a beating       

2
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,191
       during the brief,        
      but fast run down the     
           racetrack.           

3
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,861
     the tires have to face     
     full-on acceleration       

4
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,795
    right out of the starting   
             gate,              

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,431
    then heavy-duty braking     
    after the finish line,      

6
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,668
          with the car          
  deploying a rear parachute    

7
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,437
   and slowing to an eventual   
             stop.              

8
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,409
         a drag race is         
     the ultimate automotive    
            sprint,             

9
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,677
    with rapid acceleration     

10
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,415
           to speeds            
  topping 310 miles per hour.   

11
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,951
     optimal tire traction      
   can give a car the winning   
             edge.              

12
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,822
    dragster tires, like most   
             tires,             
     are made from rubber,      

13
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,158
    which hasn't been cured     
to a firm and permanent state.  

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,894
  for most parts of the tire,   

15
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,230
   they reinforce the rubber    
      with nylon fabric.        

16
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,100
  the machine heats and kneads  
 rubber slabs until they melt,  

17
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:45,037
  then coats both sides of the  
material with a molten rubber.  

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,240
   when the fabric-reinforced   
    sheet of rubber cools,      

19
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,777
   the machine slices it into   
 pieces of a specific length,   

20
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,448
 making the cuts at a diagonal, 
     called a bias angle.       

21
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,118
  a skilled tire builder then   
 joins the edges of the piece   

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,052
        to form a band,         

23
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,188
sticks it to an identical band  

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,323
            made of             
   an opposite bias piece --    

25
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,458
layering increases strength --  

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,329
   then stretches this two-ply  
              band              
 over a tire-building machine.  

27
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,798
  next, he applies the belts,   

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,135
    two opposing bias pieces    
 of fabric-reinforced rubber,   

29
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:20,873
 which he lays diagonally onto  
  the tread area of the tire.   

30
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,676
 a laser guide marks the edges  

31
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,678
 so that he can match the belts 
        to each other.          

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,949
 these belts help give the tire 
     stiffness, strength,       

33
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,584
        and stability.          

34
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:39,091
        he uses a roller        
 to press out any trapped air   

35
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,160
 between the plies and belts.   

36
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,762
       this helps ensure        
       a thorough bond.         

37
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,299
     after a stitcher wheel     
     folds down the plies,      

38
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:50,836
      he folds the ends of      
the material into the machine.  

39
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,905
        then, he applies        
a contact cement-type material  

40
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,375
     to enhance the natural     
            adhesion            
      of uncured rubber.        

41
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:02,381
     meanwhile, an automated    
             machine            
    makes the tires' beads,     

42
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,984
  the rigid hoops around both   
     sides of the opening,      

43
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,385
      which holds the tire      
     firmly to the wheel.       

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,923
       each bead is made        
   from a thick, steel wire.    

45
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:15,194
          the machine           
    first encapsulates it in    
            rubber.             

46
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,540
 then, it winds the bead around 
  a mandrill up to 50 times,    

47
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,874
        forming a hoop.         

48
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,144
  the machine forms four beads  
          at a time.            

49
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,017
   the next machine wraps the   
              hoop              

50
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,420
           in a piece           
 of fabric-reinforced rubber.   

51
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,890
     this additional layer      
  will stiffen the sidewall,    

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,959
      the non-treaded area      
         of the tire.           

53
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,767
    the builder uses a tool     
     called a bead server       

54
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,436
  to mount the finished bead.   

55
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,904
  while the tire is spinning,   

56
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,640
     he applies the contact     
     cement-type material       

57
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,843
            to help             
 the rubber-to-rubber adhesion  

58
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,480
 when he wraps the plies around 
the bead to secure it further.  

59
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:14,787
       the stitcher wheel       
    smoothes the plies flat     

60
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,256
  and pushes out trapped air.   

61
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,858
    then, the tire builder      

62
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,729
       applies a strip of       
   fabric-reinforced rubber on  
              top               

63
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,264
      and rolls it flat.        

64
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,200
      this strip will make      
  the bead area more durable    

65
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,802
         when the tire          
    is mounted on a wheel.      

66
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,071
       he applies a layer       
   of non-reinforced rubber     

67
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,339
       on the sidewall.         

68
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,009
          this covers           
    the edges of the plies      

69
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:41,013
     and will help the tire     
retain air once it's inflated.  

70
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,216
  this machine makes the tread  
               by               
    extruding molten rubber     

71
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,152
         through a dye          
   into a continuous strip,     

72
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,489
        then applying it        
    onto the spinning tire.     

73
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:54,360
   the fully constructed tire   
now goes into a press to cure.  

74
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,696
   inside, a hot mold closes    
     around the perimeter,      

75
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,832
      while a bag inflates      
        in the middle,          

76
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:03,302
    pushing the tire outward    
against the walls of the mold.  

77
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,704
    when the tire comes out,    
   about half an hour later,    

78
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,240
    the rubber is no longer     
       soft and pliable,        

79
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,109
   and its chemical structure   
        is stabilized,          

80
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,379
      locking in the final      
          dimensions.           

81
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,582
 workers seal the wheel opening 
     and inflate the tire       

82
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,918
       to hold the shape        
    until the rubber cools.     

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,854
   once the rubber has cooled   
     to room temperature,       

84
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,388
  which takes about an hour,    

85
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,592
  the tire undergoes a series   
  of quality-control checks.    

86
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,995
    here, a worker performs     
      a visual inspection       

87
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,465
    while trimming off excess   
             rubber             
      from the bead area.       

88
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:37,469
    before the decals go on,    
   they also x-ray the tire,    

89
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,872
    looking for any internal    
             flaws.             

90
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,210
     life in the fast lane,     
   while exciting, is short.    

91
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:46,212
         dragster tires         
      need to be replaced       

92
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:50,082
    every four to six trips     
     down the drag strip.       

93
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,766
   narrator: icing dates back   
   to 17th-century england.     

94
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,703
         early versions         
    were poured directly onto   
             cake.              

95
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,504
       the cake was then        
     put back in the oven       

96
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,374
       until the topping        
 cooked into an icelike glaze,  

97
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,443
     hence the term icing.      

98
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:21,814
    hundreds of years later,    
 success never tasted sweeter.  

99
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,722
 today, icing comes ready-made  
      in cans and tubes.        

100
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,925
 no need to make a sticky mess  
        in the kitchen.         

101
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,928
     just press the nozzle      
 to transform a plain cupcake   

102
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,398
  into an elaborate dessert.    

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,268
   it takes a dozen different   
  ingredients to make icing,    

104
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,538
         beginning with         
   vegetable-oil shortening.    

105
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,808
 they encapsulate food coloring 
  in the block of shortening.   

106
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,677
  this keeps the food coloring  
    from becoming airborne,     

107
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,213
      as a mixture creams       
  the shortening with sugar,    

108
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,483
        which they pipe         
directly into the mixer basin.  

109
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,153
  sugar is the main ingredient  
           in icing.            

110
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,760
           corn syrup           
    is the next ingredient.     

111
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:12,163
     it adds more sweetness     
   and liquidity to the mix.    

112
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,367
  the mixer arm spirals around  
  the basin for a few minutes   

113
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,771
     to blend everything.       

114
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:25,110
   then, they add cornstarch,   
              which             
    will act as a thickening    
             agent.             

115
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,980
 they pour warm water into the  
mixture and beat until smooth.  

116
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,650
    if the icing consistency    
         is too thin,           

117
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:35,254
    they thicken it with more   
             sugar.             

118
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:38,657
    this 1,000-pound batch of   
              icing             
           is done,             

119
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:43,061
   and there's enough to fill   
     2,000 aluminum cans.       

120
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,930
           a conveyor           
 delivers the cans to fillers   

121
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,535
    that inject half a pound    
    of icing into each can.     

122
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,811
        the system fills        
      3,600 cans an hour,       

123
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:02,147
     and no one has to get      
     their fingers sticky.      

124
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,217
   plastic nozzles now funnel   
    toward the containers,      

125
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,085
   and with perfect timing,     

126
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,290
   a press seals one to each    
   of the icing-filled cans.    

127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,893
       at the same time,        

128
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,364
 a pump shoots air into a small 
hole in the bottom of the can.  

129
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:22,468
  this pressurizes the icing so 
               it               
can be pumped out when needed.  

130
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,905
    the burst of air carries    
  a tiny, rubber cap with it,   

131
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,476
     and it plugs the hole      
   to maintain the pressure.    

132
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:37,082
 the cans move forward and meet 
 up with the applicator tips.   

133
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,187
 there are four tips per can,   

134
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,123
         held together          
by little, plastic connectors.  

135
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,260
  the four applicator clusters  
    fall out of the feeder      

136
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,362
 and land on the can nozzles.   

137
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,567
    clear caps then fall into   
              place             
         on the cans.           

138
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:03,008
 a blade cuts a labeled plastic 
 sleeve to the correct length.  

139
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,477
    the sleeve drops onto the   
             cans,              

140
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,980
      draping them loosely      
        for the moment.         

141
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,618
          they ride by          
    a spinning plastic disk     

142
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,055
     that tucks the sleeves     
       all the way down.        

143
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,492
   then, it's into a drier,     

144
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:24,496
   where the heat shrinks the   
              wrap              
    to the cans, sealing the    
             icing.             

145
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,368
      it's a perfect fit.       

146
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,843
     next, they make icing      
    for packaging in squeeze    
             tubes.             

147
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,179
      they blend together       
     the same ingredients,      

148
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,450
    but in different amounts    
   and in a different order.    

149
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:47,519
         this achieves          
    a thicker consistency.      

150
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:53,058
   thicker icing can be more    
 easily squeezed out of tubes.  

151
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,062
    for ready-made icing, it    
             really             
   is all in the packaging.     

152
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,732
        a mechanized arm        
   picks up the squeeze tube    

153
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,735
        and delivers it         
    to the filling machine.     

154
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,442
  a vacuum pump sucks out air   
     and any contaminants.      

155
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:16,748
       another mechanism        
 orients the tube for filling.  

156
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,484
   nozzles now inject thick,    
 yellow icing into the tubes,   

157
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,286
         but stop short         
    at a complete fill-up,      

158
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,556
         leaving space          
for the open ends to be closed  

159
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,492
    and sealed by hot jaws.     

160
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:36,101
          once closed,          
 the machine ejects the tubes.  

161
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,638
       each one contains        
     four ounces of icing.      

162
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,107
    it's about half as much     
          as the can.           

163
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,976
     to decorate with icing     
         from a tube,           

164
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,980
    the consumer squeezes it    
    out of the bottom tip.      

165
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,386
   to apply icing from a can,   
  you pump it out of the top.   

166
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:58,957
   no matter how you ice it,    
   the result will be sweet.    

167
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,610
         the egyptians          
built the earliest known docks  

168
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,546
  on the shores of the red sea  
        around 2500 bc.         

169
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,415
 more than 4,000 years later,   

170
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,684
    our lakes and rivers are    
             dotted             
   with floating structures     

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,021
     where boaters can dock     
  their crafts, go for a dip,   

172
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,826
  or just lounge in the sun.    

173
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,895
   floating docks can be much   
              more              

174
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,698
       than just walkways       
  where you tie up your boat.   

175
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,501
     they can be waterborne     
            buildings           
  with slips, jet-ski ports,    

176
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,838
   and even a rooftop deck.     

177
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
   this facility has created    

178
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,576
     its own computer-aided     
       design software.         

179
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:55,714
    with it, they can quickly   
             design             
   each component of a dock in  
              3-d.              

180
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,051
      the program will even     
            calculate           
  how many floats are needed    

181
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,352
    and where they should be    
             placed             

182
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:03,255
     to keep the dock level     
         in the water.          

183
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:06,591
   thanks to its lightweight,   
      rustproof strength,       

184
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,062
 aluminum is the ideal material 
      for building docks.       

185
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:14,066
 all the aluminum here has been 
   extruded in unique shapes    

186
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,534
           according            
  to the design requirements.   

187
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,805
     the plans are printed,     
    and workers consult them    
            closely             

188
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,607
          as they cut           
    and form the material.      

189
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,742
      the blades they use       
    are specially designed      

190
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,278
     for cutting aluminum.      

191
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,414
 they use a variety of methods  
      to form the shapes,       

192
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,284
    including drill presses     
   equipped with components     

193
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:35,620
       called hole saws.        

194
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,223
  workers lay the material out  
     on the factory floor       

195
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,626
         in preparation         
 for assembling the structure.  

196
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,962
       the final assembly       
     of the floating docks      

197
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,834
    will happen on the water    
         at the site.           

198
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,036
    they tack-weld the parts    
        to each other,          

199
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,839
         then make sure         
everything is perfectly square  

200
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,374
 before doing the final weld.   

201
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,778
  unlike steel, aluminum loses  
  strength when it's welded.    

202
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,515
        for this reason,        
 the designers of these docks   

203
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:07,853
 have created special aluminum  
sleeves for every major joint.  

204
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,188
 that means there's extra metal 
      supporting the weld       

205
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,326
      and strengthening the     
           structure.           

206
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,328
          to make sure          
   everything fits properly,    

207
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,864
 the workers join the sections  
         to each other          

208
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,867
   with stainless-steel bolts   
        and lock nuts.          

209
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,470
   there is minimal reaction    
 between the different metals,  

210
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,605
        because there is        
   so little stainless steel    

211
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,409
    relative to the quantity    
    of aluminum being used.     

212
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,479
    once the bottom section     
   of the dock is assembled,    

213
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,814
 workers build up from there.   

214
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,817
      for this test phase,      
      they use shortened,       

215
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,287
      temporary roof poles      
  to make the process easier.   

216
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,490
 the blue material on the poles 
   is polyethylene bushing,     

217
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,692
    which prevents creaking     

218
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,962
   when the dock is stressed    
      in turbulent water.       

219
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,031
        because aluminum        
      is so lightweight,        

220
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,167
   there's no need for cranes   
 in an aluminum dock facility.  

221
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,505
      manpower is enough.       

222
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,909
    workers attach a series     
  of narrow, aluminum tubes,    

223
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,511
        called purlins,         
     to the roof and deck.      

224
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,315
  workers install the roofing   
     by screwing it into the    
            purlins.            

225
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,318
         in most cases,         
  the roof won't be installed   

226
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,587
  until the dock is assembled   
           on-site.             

227
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,057
   satisfied that everything    
     assembles correctly,       

228
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,459
the workers take it all apart.  

229
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,263
  they flip the lower sections  
  over and attach the floats.   

230
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,800
    these floats consist of     
    roto-molded polyethylene    
            shells.             

231
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:32,270
       styrofoam has been       
       expanded in place        

232
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,206
    to fit inside the shell     
          perfectly.            

233
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,210
     even if the outer shell    
             breaks,            
  the dock will still float.    

234
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,880
      this facility offers      
  a range of decking options    

235
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,217
   from aluminum to concrete    
     to plastic composite       

236
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,821
    to specialty woods like     
this one, which is called ipe.  

237
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:54,625
  like teak, ipe is incredibly  
 durable and extremely stable.  

238
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,163
 in other words, it won't rot,  
      swell, or contract,       

239
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:02,200
   despite extended exposure    
       to a high-humidity       
          environment.          

240
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,441
 if the dock has an upper deck, 
      it needs a railing.       

241
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,309
     it's important to have     
            something           
        to lean against         

242
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,712
 when you're sipping cocktails  
    and watching the sunset     

243
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,113
    after a long boat ride.     

244
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,917
      of course, it's also      
   a crucial safety feature.    

245
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,053
     there are 12 different     
    components to assemble      

246
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,655
  for just this one section,    

247
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,792
   and there might be as many   
   as 15 different sections     

248
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:29,561
       of varying lengths       
      for an entire dock.       

249
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,166
  customers can choose to add   
    a range of accessories      

250
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,735
       to floating docks        
    made at this facility.      

251
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,070
   to make things like safety   
     railings and ladders,      

252
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,607
          workers use           
  a hydraulic bending machine   

253
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,610
    to shape aluminum tubing    
   to the required contours.    

254
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,746
     all the aluminum these     
       manufacturers use        

255
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,748
    in their floating docks     
    is a marine-grade alloy     

256
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,285
      especially resistant      
        to degradation          

257
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,754
    when exposed to water.      

258
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,890
  finally, it's time to build   
      the docks in place.       

259
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,360
 thanks to careful planning on  
the part of the manufacturers,  

260
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,095
     assembly is a breeze.      

261
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,898
     the crew doesn't need      
 much more than a ratchet set   

262
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,233
   to pull it all together.     

263
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,570
      it's smooth sailing       
       from here on out.        

264
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,920
   in the modern world, steel   
              pipes             
  form an underground network   

265
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,190
     to deliver necessities     
 like drinking water or fuel.   

266
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,193
     these pipes are often      
        spirally welded         

267
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,195
 and can be made in any size.   

268
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,532
      in fact, longer pipe      
      means fewer joints        

269
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,468
         and less work          
 to install them underground.   

270
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,676
  spirally welded pipes can be  
  short, or they can go on and  
              on.               

271
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,745
      the potential length      
         is limitless,          

272
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,947
            because,            
 unlike other kinds of pipes,   

273
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,016
          spiral pipes          
     don't have to conform      

274
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,621
  to the size of a forming roll 
               or               
    the dimensions of a steel   
             plate.             

275
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:07,425
   they can spiral-weld these   
              coils             
  of steel sheets endlessly.    

276
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,032
   but first they have to take  
               the              
 kink out of the coiled steel.  

277
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,301
     a machine unwinds it       

278
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:22,506
 and pushes it between rollers  
   to completely flatten it.    

279
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,776
    a fixed arm then presses    
   the steel against rollers    

280
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,446
          to round it           
    to a precise diameter,      

281
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,650
 and an automated system welds  
    the formed pipe from the    
            inside.             

282
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,186
    a barely visible mantel     
       of powdered flux         

283
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,589
 protects the welding process.  

284
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,395
   copper-coated steel wire     

285
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,864
   acts as both an electrode    
    for the welding process     

286
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:49,200
    and as filler material.     

287
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,903
with the inside weld complete,  

288
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,406
     a second welder device     
   works on the outside of the  
              pipe              

289
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,342
   to give it a double-welded   
             seam.              

290
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,549
  a plasma torch cuts the pipe  
  to length cleanly by melting  
              it.               

291
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,685
         in this case,          
  they're making a water pipe   

292
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:12,090
   that's 6 feet in diameter    
    and 50 feet in length.      

293
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:16,361
    the pipe then rolls over    
     to the next station.       

294
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,232
     here, a worker grinds      
     both ends of the pipe      

295
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:23,068
    to improve the profile.     

296
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,507
   then it's over to a die.     

297
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,175
   it stretches one end of the  
              pipe              

298
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,512
   to create a slight flare,    
           or bell.             

299
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,014
     this will allow it to      
  be connected to the narrower  
              end               

300
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:41,119
    of another pipe, forming    
 what's known as a lap joint.   

301
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,454
         next, they cap         
     the ends of the pipe       

302
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,992
       and pump in water        
to a highly pressurized state.  

303
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:48,660
   they look for leaks in the   
              weld              

304
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,995
          and confirm           
     that it's watertight.      

305
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,532
 another worker installs rubber 
dams at both ends of the pipe.  

306
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:04,709
   a cement fixture then flows  
              into              
    a long applicator with a    
            nozzle.             

307
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:11,082
 the nozzle applies the cement  
   to the pipe's inner wall     

308
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,285
      as the pipe spins and     
            generates           
     a centrifugal effect       

309
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,755
        that's 70 times         
     the force of gravity.      

310
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:20,291
     this causes the cement     
 to be distributed uniformly.   

311
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:24,829
    the rubber dams contain     
     the cement during this     
            process.            

312
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,298
  the spinning displaces water  
        in the cement,          

313
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,369
 and a blower forces that water 
       out of the pipe.         

314
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,039
 next, a worker drapes plastic  
  onto both ends of the pipe.   

315
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,842
   he tacks it with magnets     

316
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,078
  and then secures it tightly   
     with an elastic cord.      

317
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,850
       he pumps hot steam       
        into the pipe.          

318
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:51,122
   over a period of 18 hours,   
  the steam cures the cement.   

319
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,925
        it's a slow cure        
      for better structural     
           integrity.           

320
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,728
        for our camera,         
 they open one end of the pipe  

321
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,198
       for an inside look       
    at the steaming action.     

322
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,801
        18 hours later,         
 they remove the rubber dams.   

323
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:09,140
 the spiral-welded pipe now has 
    a tough, protective inner   
             liner.             

324
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,410
   next, the pipe moves into    
       a blast chamber,         

325
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,480
     where fine, steel shot     
   bombards the outside of the  
              pipe              

326
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,482
    to clean it thoroughly.     

327
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:20,552
        this prepares it        
      for the next step.        

328
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,490
       a sprayer applies        
      a liquid adhesive.        

329
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,962
  over the adhesive, they wrap  
  a polyethylene-backed tape.   

330
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,900
           they apply           
   a total of three layers of   
             tape.              

331
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,903
         the first one          
 provides corrosion protection  

332
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,439
 to the spirally welded steel.  

333
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,843
      the other two layers      
      protect the first.        

334
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:50,782
 they give the spirally welded  
   pipe a tough outer skin.     

335
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,584
       the three tapes are      
          color-coded.          

336
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,786
        this will allow         
    the depth of any damage     

337
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,389
     to be quickly assessed     
            on-site.            

338
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,533
   they produce approximately   
15 spirally welded water pipes  

339
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:12,070
      per eight-hour shift      
       at this factory.         

340
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,810
 they should last for a century 
         underground.
