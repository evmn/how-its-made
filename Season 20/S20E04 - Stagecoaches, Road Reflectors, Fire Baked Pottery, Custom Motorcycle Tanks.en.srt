captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,988
narrator: long before trains and buses,  

4
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,325
the stagecoach transported passengers and goods.      

5
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:02,328
the coach would travel an established route in stages.             

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,264
but over time, the word "stage" was used    

7
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,333
to describe the coach itself.  

8
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,402
drawn by two or four animals,  

9
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,572
it relied quite literally on horsepower.          

10
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,677
like a classic movie scene come alive,           

11
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:23,616
seeing a stagecoach in action is a throwback to a bygone era.              

12
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,419
even today, building a stagecoach,      

13
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,088
horse-drawn carriage, or covered wagon         

14
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,690
borrows techniques from a time  

15
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:33,626
when engineering and design were done by hand.        

16
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:37,897
the creation of the stagecoach begins with drawings       

17
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,833
detailing both the look of the final product       

18
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,234
and its exact dimensions.    

19
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:46,438
they start with construction of the stagecoach body.     

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,976
a worker puts framing rails for the back wall into place   

21
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,446
using a mortise and a tenon joint.        

22
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,048
the final panel slides into place,        

23
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,518
and another framing rail holds the end wall together.   

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,120
the end wall is added      

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,390
to other pieces of the stagecoach body      

26
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,859
that have already been assembled.         

27
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,929
the end wall has ribbing for added strength.       

28
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,466
although the floor is partially curved,       

29
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,069
passengers will sit or stand on the part that is flat.    

30
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:21,073
the coach maker inserts the door pillars into the mortise     

31
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,075
with a few taps of a hammer.   

32
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:27,345
he lowers the roof beam onto the top part of the door pillars             

33
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,449
and fastens it firmly into place.        

34
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:37,156
forging of stagecoach suspension components is done by hand.   

35
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,893
the blacksmith begins stretching the heated bar of steel     

36
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,028
into a component called a jack.              

37
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,431
he repeatedly heats and hammers the steel bar          

38
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,034
until it reaches the desired shape.        

39
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,636
he hammers the tapered steel bar over an anvil          

40
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,973
to shape it into a curved hook.              

41
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:57,375
once the hook becomes an eye, he hammers a pin into it.    

42
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,979
the blacksmith wraps the heated steel around the pin               

43
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,181
to form a snug joint.      

44
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,050
the transformation is done    

45
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,585
without the help of presses or dies.       

46
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,920
it's the blacksmith       

47
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,322
who essentially sculpts the metal bar          

48
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,391
into a piece that has both function and form.     

49
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,128
the blacksmith positions the finished and cooled jack   

50
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,529
onto the undercarriage      

51
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,866
and attaches it firmly into place.           

52
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,669
the assembly has to withstand the stresses           

53
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,738
of the leather suspension    

54
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,075
used to make the stagecoach ride more comfortable for passengers.           

55
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,081
using a clip, the blacksmith attaches the step              

56
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,483
used to climb into the stagecoach       

57
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,019
to the jack assembly.      

58
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,689
he attaches a clevis to the jack assembly.      

59
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,491
with four jacks in opposing corners,       

60
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:51,363
the leather suspension will rest in the clevises.    

61
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:55,100
now on to the stagecoach interior.     

62
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:59,505
the trimmer inspects the hide of leather.       

63
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,574
he positions patterns carefully,           

64
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,310
choosing leather cuts that match.           

65
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,378
then he'll cut the leather pieces        

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,047
with each pattern designated   

67
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,149
for a specific part of the stagecoach.        

68
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:16,188
he places the newly upholstered cushion on the seat bench    

69
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,326
and buckles the retaining straps that hold it securely in place.             

70
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,402
in the paint booth, this particular undercarriage  

71
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,405
is given coats of yellow and black stripes.   

72
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,275
a worker coats the running gear and wheels with sealer      

73
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,144
to weatherproof the undercarriage.        

74
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,414
workers gently lower the newly painted and upholstered wagon  

75
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,583
onto the undercarriage.     

76
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:52,824
they connect the two using mounting bolts.      

77
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,362
they fix the name plate to the center of the rear axle.              

78
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,170
to help protect passengers from the elements,        

79
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:07,772
this particular model comes with a roof.        

80
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,243
workers lower the roof posts into receiver eyes        

81
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,913
and make sure they're securely attached.    

82
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,783
next, a worker positions a brake pad           

83
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,152
against one of the rear wagon wheels.    

84
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,124
he then tests the brake assembly.       

85
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,265
the face of the brake pad can be wood, steel, or rubber,     

86
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,002
depending on the vocation of the wagon.          

87
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,273
now for a suspension test.    

88
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:45,010
the process that began with raw lumber and steel    

89
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,545
ends up about 1,200 hours later              

90
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,083
with a stagecoach that's ready to hit the dusty trail.     

91
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,766
narrator: road reflectors originated   

92
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,169
a cat's eyes reflected in headlights on a foggy night,             

93
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,638
alerting a driver to the fact  

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,573
that he was about to veer off the road,   

95
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,042
provided the flash of inspiration.         

96
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,643
the driver went on to invent   

97
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,046
a mechanical version of the cat's eyes --       

98
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,148
reflective road studs.      

99
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,787
today's reflective road studs  

100
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,189
are shining examples of innovation.          

101
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,126
these versions are computerized and solar-powered,        

102
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,728
so they're energy efficient   

103
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,797
and they'll function in a power blackout.       

104
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:48,807
it takes more than 20 parts to make one road reflector.   

105
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,343
the assembler first solders two wires     

106
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,946
to the back of a solar circuitry board,   

107
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:57,216
establishing a connection.    

108
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:00,085
she flips the solar circuitry board around      

109
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,555
and applies double-sided tape.  

110
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,357
she places two strips of copper             

111
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,929
on conductive pads       
in the corners above the tape.  

112
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:15,968
she removes the backing from the double-sided tape.   

113
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,836
using a vacuum tool,       

114
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,506
she transfers the solar cell to the tape.           

115
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,509
once in place, she turns off the vacuum     

116
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,912
and smoothes the cell to the tape.           

117
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:31,383
she solders the copper strips to the conductive pads,     

118
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,252
creating the circuitry.     

119
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,922
she connects the solar panel to the board           

120
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,725
with short, little wires called jumpers.         

121
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,195
she slides rubber protectors onto the board.         

122
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:47,665
each road reflector will have two of these solar units.    

123
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,936
next, she assembles the flashing l.e.d. lights.   

124
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,472
she solders wires to the back panels        

125
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,411
to link the lights to the main computer board.   

126
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:03,148
she then applies adhesive to the panel           

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,651
and presses the framework for the l.e.d. lens to it.    

128
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,761
she inserts the polycarbonate lens into the framework,     

129
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,830
and it clicks in.        

130
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:22,233
there are two l.e.d. lights per road reflector.       

131
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,837
she now assembles the reflector.           

132
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,575
she angles shiny aluminum flaps to bounce light.         

133
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:34,913
she tucks the lights into the reflector,       

134
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,915
and they adhere to the double-sided tape     

135
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,584
applied to the base.       

136
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,321
she powers up the flashing lights       

137
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,923
and checks the intensity     

138
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,760
and the effect of the reflective flaps.     

139
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,600
things are looking good, so now she inserts foam     

140
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,003
in a slot at the center of the aluminum casing.     

141
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:02,207
she places the reflective light unit on it.        

142
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,478
she installs a foam-wrapped rechargeable battery       

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,482
in a compartment on one side of the lights.    

144
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,819
she places the main       
computer board and solar cells  

145
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,455
in the compartment on the other side.        

146
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:24,496
and then a computer technician programs the road reflector   

147
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,767
to interface with a control system on the street pole.    

148
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,036
the reflector is now ready to stop traffic         

149
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,506
or at least slow it down.    

150
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,242
a crew carves a slot in the road              

151
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,044
sized precisely for the reflector.        

152
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,516
to keep the pavement clean during installation,       

153
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:49,588
one of them tapes the perimeter of the hole.    

154
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,722
he then pumps          

155
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,925
industrial-strength epoxy into it.             

156
00:09:53,927 --> 00:10:00,666
he inserts a cast-iron framework into the epoxy-filled hole.   

157
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:05,237
he wipes up the epoxy overflow and removes the tape.      

158
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,675
entrenched in the pavement,   

159
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,211
this cast-iron framework will encase the road reflector,           

160
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:16,548
allowing it to hold up to heavy traffic.        

161
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,952
he screws a protective crossbar over the lights         

162
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,622
and then secures the road reflector        

163
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,357
to the support structure.    

164
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,493
they install the wireless communication system       

165
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,962
atop a pole.           

166
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,098
this positions it to activate the road reflectors           

167
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,735
when the curbside crosswalk button has been pressed.     

168
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,642
modern communications technology           

169
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,978
has improved on this 1930s invention.     

170
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,184
today's road reflector systems are flashier than ever,     

171
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:55,520
designed to attract a driver's attention       

172
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,257
and keep it on the road.     

173
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,810
narrator: in tribal communities in the american southwest,    

174
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,147
pottery takes shape much as it has for 2,000 years.             

175
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,483
in the hands of native artisans,            

176
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:27,752
mud becomes a cooking pot or a storage vessel.       

177
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:31,556
no pottery wheel necessary, no kiln required --       

178
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,792
just a roaring campfire.     

179
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,765
times may change, but in the southwest,      

180
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,234
tribal culture is true to its roots,      

181
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,103
creating pots that look like ancient artifacts,        

182
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,105
except they're new.       

183
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,840
crafted from local clay,     

184
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,110
the pots are both lightweight and durable,           

185
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,314
and their appeal is truly timeless.        

186
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,649
the potter gathers her own clay.              

187
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:02,453
this is micaceous clay from volcanic deposits in new mexico.             

188
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,390
she also mines minerals like iron oxide         

189
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,992
to paint the pottery.      

190
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:11,062
in its raw form, micaceous clay sparkles in the sunlight.    

191
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,866
its natural glitter will make the finished pottery shimmer.  

192
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,268
she picks out leaves and tree roots          

193
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,671
because anything organic will outgas           

194
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,340
and cause the pottery to crack.             

195
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,744
she transfers the clay to a bucket of water.      

196
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,615
after three or four days, it dissolves,          

197
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:34,085
and she filters it to remove smaller contaminants.          

198
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,555
once the clay thickens to a gravy-like consistency,   

199
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,358
she transfers it to a fabric-lined mold.     

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,227
she leaves it to set       

201
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,796
and coagulate to a dough-like consistency.   

202
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:51,270
she kneads a chunk of it to remove air bubbles.      

203
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,441
she then shapes it into a bowl.              

204
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,846
it will serve as the base of a traditional storage pot.  

205
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,582
she scrapes the pot base inside and out          

206
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,718
to thin it as it dries.     

207
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,455
the thinning process also works the clay into a harder state.  

208
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:17,195
she moistens the tip of the bowl to make it malleable       

209
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,930
and flattens the edge,      

210
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,800
creating a foundation to build up the pot.       

211
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,804
she now rolls another piece of clay      

212
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,272
into a long, thin strand     

213
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,075
and coils it around the pot.   

214
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,811
she blends the strand into the pot base        

215
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,048
and then shapes it to extend the pot upward.    

216
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:42,087
the process is called coiling.  

217
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,757
she continues to build up the coils,      

218
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,026
blending them until they become completely enmeshed       

219
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,095
and seamless to the rest of the pot.     

220
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,566
as she coils and blends, she turns the pot inward,    

221
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:58,169
creating a shoulder near the top.          

222
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,838
she smoothes the lip and thins the extensions     

223
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,174
to ensure the thickness is consistent.          

224
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:07,912
this will prevent structural weakness.       

225
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:12,718
in the hands a skilled artisan, a lump of clay has become a pot,              

226
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,787
but there's more work to be done.           

227
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,723
she narrows the opening.     

228
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,130
she cuts the lip in six symbolic orientations,  

229
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,999
representing north, south, east, and west,      

230
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,269
the sky, and the earth.     

231
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,405
she scallops the edge      

232
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,575
in the direction of the cuts to accentuate them.       

233
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,614
she smoothes the pot with a wet sponge.        

234
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,550
before dawn, when the wind is low,      

235
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:50,021
she lights a fire and places the pots directly into it.    

236
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,825
she stacks wood around the pots, and flames engulf them.     

237
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,628
this changes the clay's molecular structure       

238
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,764
so that it can never turn back into sticky mud.         

239
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,367
she covers the fire with a metal tub.        

240
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:06,370
the flames subside, and the pots cool.        

241
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,041
curing clay over an open fire isn't an exact science.     

242
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,511
heat is uneven, and this causes fracturing.   

243
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,981
20% of these clay pots will be damaged.         

244
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,850
she examines them carefully   

245
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,453
and rejects anything that is not intact.       

246
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:24,922
in addition to the micaceous clay pots,   

247
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,126
she also fires some red clay ones.       

248
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,062
she paints geometric motifs onto those,           

249
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,999
using the mineral paints she's prepared herself.     

250
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,535
each pot is one of a kind.    

251
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,870
quality varies depending on the nature of the clay    

252
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:44,008
and smoke patterns created during firing.      

253
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,078
she leaves the pots made of micaceous clay unpainted   

254
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,414
for traditional reasons.     

255
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,349
she signs the vase        

256
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,752
and includes the name of her tribe.      

257
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,822
she tucks her biographical information into it.       

258
00:15:56,824 --> 00:16:00,492
she's been making pottery since childhood.         

259
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,093
from a handful of mud      

260
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,563
to a storage vessel or cooking pot,         

261
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,430
southwest native pottery     

262
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,334
continues to be a triumph of ingenuity.     

263
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,585
narrator: as a group,      

264
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,255
motorcycle riders aren't big on convention.    

265
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,657
so when it comes to the look of their ride,          

266
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,392
they often go their own way.   

267
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:37,195
the gas tank presents the greatest opportunity     

268
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,864
when customizing the facade of the bike.     

269
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,466
prominent and up-front,     

270
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,402
the tank both fuels the ride and defines it.         

271
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,607
on a car or truck,        

272
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,143
the gas tank is tucked away out of sight.          

273
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,879
but on a motorbike, there's no place to hide it,   

274
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,550
so you may as well just show it off.        

275
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,152
to make a custom gas tank,    

276
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,221
the metalworker starts with a sheet       

277
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,490
of sturdy cold-rolled steel.   

278
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,159
he traces around paper patterns            

279
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,962
to transfer their outline to the steel.          

280
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,831
there are seven pattern pieces.             

281
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,635
the design is a tapered classic one.    

282
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,906
he follows the lines with an electric metal shear.  

283
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:24,142
with it, he can produce a rough cut quickly.       

284
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,450
he switches to a lever-operated shear    

285
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,353
to trim the parts cleanly and precisely.          

286
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,392
he physically bends one piece around a tube     

287
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,394
to create the tunnel.      

288
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,730
the tunnel is the lower section of the tank  

289
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,633
that fits around the backbone portion of the bike frame.    

290
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:55,707
he cuts the tunnel to size along marked lines.       

291
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,315
he drills holes in the tunnel for the mounting tubes.     

292
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,088
using threaded bolts as guides now,          

293
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,491
he positions the two mounting tubes on the holes   

294
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:17,696
and welds them to the tunnel, creating leak-proof seams.    

295
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,504
with rods attached as a mockup of the rest of the tank,     

296
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,572
he tests the fit to the bike.  

297
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,042
he confirms the handlebars move freely    

298
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,911
and that there's no interference with the engine.         

299
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:38,849
next, he uses an english wheel on the two top panels.      

300
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,519
he rolls each panel between two wheels        

301
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,990
to take the profile from flat to curved.       

302
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:48,259
he tests the curvature against the mockup rods.     

303
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,261
it needs tweaking.        

304
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,263
he continues to shape it     

305
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:56,734
until the custom gas-tank part matches the mockup perfectly.  

306
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,204
using another machine now,    

307
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,140
he forms a stylish curl onto the edges.         

308
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,208
this will also allow the two parts          

309
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,277
to be joined neatly at the peak.              

310
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,280
after marking the location of the fuel cap,         

311
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,684
he punches small holes for mounting screws.       

312
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:16,954
he cuts out the hole for the gas cap.         

313
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,892
he joins the two top sections of the custom gas tank      

314
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,027
with tack welds.         

315
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,430
a more permanent weld will come later.         

316
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,298
he drills holes for mounting   

317
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,234
the top panel assembly to the tunnel,           

318
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,604
spacing them to correspond with the mounting tubes.     

319
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,842
with the mockup rods removed from the tunnel,     

320
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,312
he joins the top panel assembly to it.      

321
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,781
he then tack-welds the sides   

322
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,084
to this custom gas-tank assembly.        

323
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,123
he hammers the tank's front cap against a form          

324
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,427
to give the outer edges a rounded profile.        

325
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,267
he sands the part around the edges         

326
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,438
to fine-tune the contours and ensure a perfect fit.    

327
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,742
he tack-welds the front cap   

328
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,945
to the rest of the motorcycle tank.     

329
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,614
and with the tank structure complete,            

330
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,817
it's time to make it leak-proof.           

331
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,289
he does a full penetration weld on every seam.          

332
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,825
using a pneumatic tool,     

333
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,062
he sands the seam smooth and flat.            

334
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,768
he then sands the rest of the tank by hand       

335
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,437
to make the entire surface uniform.             

336
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:47,645
he positions the tank on the bike.      

337
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,982
after equipping the gas cap with a gasket,          

338
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,951
he screws it tightly to the custom tank.       

339
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,059
using mounting screws and wing nuts,          

340
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,597
he secures the tank to the bike frame.        

341
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,933
this custom gas tank now becomes a canvas.      

342
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,602
he paints it and applies silver borders    

343
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,806
and graphics requested by the customer.         

344
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:18,343
he connects the tank to the carburetor,        

345
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,379
and this bike is ready to show off its new custom look.              

346
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,424
