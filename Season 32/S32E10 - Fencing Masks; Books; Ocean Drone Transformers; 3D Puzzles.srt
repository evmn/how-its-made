  oldest forms of armed combat. 

15
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,427
    in the late 18th century,   
  fencing evolved into a sport. 

16
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,596
  as fencing gained popularity, 

17
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,864
 a steel mesh mask was invented 

18
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,968
  to protect the eyes and face  
          from injury.          

19

      as an olympic sport,

 affixing the mesh to the hoop. 

37
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,276

         a specific code        
     through plastic tubes,     

125
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,247
       while puffs of air       
  align that character's matrix 

126
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,982
   with the injection nozzle.   

127
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,319
the nozzle dispenses molten lead
         into the matrix        

128
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,622
    while the machine ejects    
       the cast character       

129
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:39,524
           onto a tray          
       called the galley.       

130
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,394
    as the lines of text exit   
          the machine,          

131
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:45,330
 the typecast specialist inserts
         a strip of lead        

132
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:49,868
    to create spacing, called   
   leading, between each line.  

133
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,738
     he transfers the galley    
       to the press room,       

134
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,141
     where a proofing press     
    spreads ink on the type.    

135
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,411
      he places a sheet of      
    newsprint over the galley   

136
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,880
          and releases          
      an impression roller.     

137
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,282
the roller prints the characters
        on to the paper,        

138
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,051
       generating a proof.      

139
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,691
     meanwhile, a typesetter    

140
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,627
      assembles the larger      
      display copy manually     

141
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,429
  by placing individual letters 

142
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,498
    into a composition stick.   

143
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,968
  this method was used for all  
   copy prior to the invention  

144
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,872
  of the automatic typecasting  
     machines in the 1890s.     

145
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,243
          books printed         
     in large sizes of type     

146
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,346

       by manual typeset.       

147
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,450
         once complete,         

148
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,453
  multiple galleys that make up 
    several pages of the book   

149
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:44,590
   are placed in a steel frame  
         called a chase         

150
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:48,861
         and loaded into        
       the printing press.      

151
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,464
    this cylinder press feeds   
  one sheet of paper at a time  

152
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:56,868
 to grippers that pull the paper
  around a cylindrical roller.  

153
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,737
     as the roller rotates,     

154
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,206
         the paper drops        
      onto the inked type,      

155
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,476
     printing the characters    
         into the sheet.        

156
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,680
    one press sheet typically   
 contains eight pages per side. 

157
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,082
         another machine        
        folds the sheets,       

158
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,619
        then bookbinders        
     manually collate groups    

159
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,155
 of 16 consecutive pages to form

160
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,091
      sections of the book      
       called signatures.       

161
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,096
     next, a bookbinder sews    
     the signatures together    

162
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,030
          one at a time         

163
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:29,101

        fully assembled.        

164
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:32,638
   this method of bookbinding,  
   called smyth sewn binding,

    is of the highest quality   

166
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,245
       because pages can't      
     fall out or be removed.

        the book cover is       
    meticulously handcrafted.   

170
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,524
     a book binder hot glues    
        a piece of cloth        

171
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,993
    to the back of the cover.   

172
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,062
        the cover is made       
        of flexible paper       

173
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:01,667
      and thick cardboard.      

174
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,137
   then she flattens the cloth  
          on all sides.         

175
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,876
      using a razor blade,      
  the book binder makes a slit  

176
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,144
         for the cloth,         

177
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:15,080
       where she'll place       
     a recessed label later.    

178
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,549
     this enables the cloth     
          to spread out         

179
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,686
     and form to the spine's    
         rounded shape.         

180
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,688
      the cloth is pressed

       attaches the cover       

183
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,565
       to the bound pages,      
     called the book block.     

184
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,502
     first, she applies glue    
       to both components.      

185
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,441

 the book block on the cover... 

186
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,545
  ...and presses them together. 

187
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,051
       she places the book      
       in a nipping press.

191
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,061

     the interior structure     
      of the vehicle starts

00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,649

    the vehicle's equipment.    

246
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,653
   in-house technicians build   
   the multiple circuit boards  

247
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,657

    processing unit, or cpu.    

248

     element of the vehicle,

  electronics and water are not 
    a compatible combination,   

251
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,940
  so the manufacturer designed  
   a water-tight acrylic tube

   all the sections are flat,   

364
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,026
     so the final step is to    
    attach the flat sections    

365
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,829
       to make the puzzle       
       three-dimensional.       

366
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,565
  for an additional challenge,  

367
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,301
          you can forgo         
  the step-by-step instructions 

368
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,137
        and refer only to       
     the photos on the box.     

369
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,841
        if you happen to        
      lose a puzzle piece,      

370
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:45,043
          you can go to         
      the company's website     

371
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,578
       to trace the number      
     of your missing piece,     

372
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,248
 then order a new piece online. 

373
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,850
 the company will mail it to you

374
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,785
         so that you can        
      complete your puzzle.     

375
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,588
      unlike a traditional      
          flat puzzle,          

376
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,594
  you can move your 3-d puzzle  
    without it falling apart.   

377
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,597
   it takes four to six months  

378
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,801
      to develop and design     
   this incredible 3-d puzzle.  

379
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,003
     now it's time to spend     
           even longer          

380
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,239
  piecing this puzzle together.
