00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,491
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,127
drill bits...         

3
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,565
...photo booths...       

4
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,706
...and stamps.         

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,586
drill bits are attachments   

6
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,121
you fasten to drilling tools. 

7
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,123
a taper-point drill narrows to a point       

8
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,192
so the threads of the screw grab the wood.         

9
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,195
a countersink makes the top of the hole the same diameter 

10
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,462
as the screw head       

11
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,732
so that the head lies flush or below the surface.     

12
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,934
a plug cutter removes a round piece of wood     

13
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,869
with which you plug the hole afterward       

14
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,137
to hide the sunken screw.   

15
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,544
countersinks and plug cutters start out as steel bars.    

16
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,677
to make a countersink,     

17
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,613
this computer-guided tooling machine        

18
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,482
uses what's called a center drill         

19
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,750
to pierce a starting hole,   

20
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,753
then switches to its main drill,
which bores right through.   

21
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,223
next, it uses what's called a rough turning tool      

22
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,360
to shape the countersink's angled nose, then its body.  

23
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,297
the machine now switches to a milling cutter.      

24
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,233
this tool shapes the countersink's four blades. 

25
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,441
a cross-drilling tool bores a hole for the two screws   

26
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,377
that'll hold the countersink to the drill.         

27
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,779
a tap cuts threads into the hole.         

28
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,984
next, a tool called a dovetail cutter sharpens the blades.  

29
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,323
then, finally, a cutoff blade removes the tool.       

30
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,063
the same machine makes plug cutters.      

31
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,266
its center drill makes a starting hole,     

32
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,402
but this time, the main drill doesn't bore right through.  

33
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,739
it stops at the depth that the plug cutter is designed to cut.

34
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,076
just as before, the rough turning tool shapes the body, 

35
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,879
and the milling cutter sculpts the four blades.    

36
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,683
some plug cutters on the market
have fewer blades.       

37
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,018
this company makes four    

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,154
so the cutter will clear the wood chips more efficiently

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,690
when it tunnels into the wood. 

40
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,560
after the dovetail cutter sharpens the blades,      

41
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,963
a tool called a boring bar refines the hole in the center,

42
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,632
making it the proper size.   

43
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,101
another turning tool now forms the shank,      

44
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,835
the stem of the plug cutter  

45
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,505
that you insert into the power tool.      

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,041
then the cutoff blade slices the tool off.      

47
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,779
now for some manual touch-ups. 

48
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,183
first, they grind the plug   
cutter against an abrasive wheel

49
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,586
to remove excess metal from the cutoff.        

50
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,856
then they do what's called side-chipping,         

51
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,193
grinding the sides of each blade
to a particular shape     

52
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,995
that'll clear the wood chips. 

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,066
here's how the plug cutter looks

54
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,602
before and after grinding off the excess           

55
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,804
and before and after side-chipping.         

56
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,876
and now for making the drills 

57
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,044
to which the countersinks attach.            

58
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,614
it all starts with a tapered piece of steel 

59
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,283
because this will become a taper-point drill.      

60
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,086
straight drills begin with a straight piece.     

61
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,489
a mechanical arm inserts this drill blank, as it's called,  

62
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,357
into a computer-guided grinder.

63
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,827
the machine has two wheels made of boron nitrite granules,

64
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,564
a natural material that's tough
and abrasive.         

65
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,900
the first wheel shapes the smooth blank    

66
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,369
into lengthwise spirals called flutes.         

67
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,772
a second wheel then grinds sharp
cutting edges on the flutes  

68
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,642
and shapes the tip of the drill
to a point.          

69
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,578
back to the countersinks now. 

70
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,247
the steel is still relatively malleable,     

71
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,184
so a worker runs each one through a stamping machine   

72
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:16,321
that imprints the size of the tool and the company name. 

73
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,457
whereas the drills are made of a different type of steel  

74
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,926
that's already hard enough,  

75
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,994
the countersinks and plug cutters        

76
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,863
must undergo a heat-treating process to harden --      

77
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,666
about 20 minutes in a fiery oven

78
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,001
along with a secret recipe of chemicals.         

79
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,271
the intense heat -- 1,750 degrees fahrenheit --  

80
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,607
transforms those chemicals into gases           

81
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,277
which then permeate and harden the steel.     

82
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,213
after cooling in warm water and oil for about 15 minutes, 

83
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,815
workers submerge the tools   

84
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,817
in an industrial-strength cleaning solution       

85
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,152
that removes all the oil grit, 

86
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,723
then a bath in acid to remove soot from the oven. 

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,428
then, finally, 20 minutes in a blackening solution,   

88
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,630
the ingredients of which are, again,          

89
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,632
a closely guarded company secret.        

90
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,768
this last step is purely cosmetic.      

91
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:09,174
so, how do the three drill bits
we've seen all work together? 

92
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,110
first, you use the plug cutter to make the plug.       

93
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,946
then you pop out the plug with a screwdriver.      

94
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,853
next, mounting the countersink,
that black tool,        

95
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,521
onto the taper-point drill.  

96
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,792
you drill a hole for the screw.

97
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,261
then you drive the screw into the hole,         

98
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,129
sinking it below the surface. 

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,601
then you cap the hole with a plug.          

100
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,610
these tools come in an extensive
range of sizes and grades   

101
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,014
for both amateur and professional woodworkers  

102
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,049
and for industrial machines.  

103
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,294
narrator: photo booths were first introduced in the 1920s 

104
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,628
in the united states.     

105
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,098
today, the small, private cabins
still enable us to be kooky  

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,102
in several snapshots or one large picture.     

107
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,038
the booths are quaint reminders
of our pop culture,      

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
but they use the latest technology           

109
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,342
to make portraits worth treasuring.       

110
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,314
this model simulates a painting

111
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,185
or a drawing based on the photo
it takes of you.        

112
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,654
to customize the preassembled cabin,    

113
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,190
a worker applies stickers to the outside.        

114
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,192
these advertise local businesses

115
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,327
or the booth's eventual location,       

116
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,164
such as a shopping mall or amusement park.       

117
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,939
inside, there are five shelves for equipment.         

118
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,610
two layers of plexiglass glued together         

119
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,212
will act as safety glass,   

120
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,214
protecting the equipment from vandals.         

121
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,150
it fits over an opening in the wall          

122
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,750
that divides the seating area 

123
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,187
from the camera and a tv monitor.       

124
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,758
the worker installs a metal plate in another opening.   

125
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,494
it will cover the coin acceptor

126
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,029
and give the booth operator access to the money      

127
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,566
people pay to have their photo taken.       

128
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,035
the coin acceptor attaches to brackets      

129
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,503
on the back of the door.    

130
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,840
they'll program it to accept tokens or specific currencies. 

131
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,310
a black-and-white photo usually costs $3.       

132
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,611
color is $5.          

133
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,420
this 15-watt bulb provides some light for your photo.   

134
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,423
it goes in a panel that fits into the wall.    

135
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,529
next, a motorized tripod to hold the camera.      

136
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,864
in this model,         

137
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:50,001
they use a digital camera with an 8-millimeter lens.   

138
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,403
"up" and "down" buttons on the control panel      

139
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,539
adjust the camera angle.    

140
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,407
a computerized voice from a speaker         

141
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,677
will prompt you to make selections.      

142
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,748
a fan attaches to the ceiling to vent the cabin       

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,417
and keep the equipment from overheating.       

144
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,286
and two 40-watt florescent lights       

145
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,289
will provide most of the frontal
lighting for the subject.   

146
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,094
another 15-watt light behind a frosted panel     

147
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,230
provides some diffuse light.  

148
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,633
the booth's power panel has connections        

149
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,635
for up to 19 pieces of equipment.         

150
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:28,172
here, a worker plugs in the camera...        

151
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,309
then a tv monitor...      

152
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,244
and an ink-jet printer.    

153
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,246
software will process the photos,          

154
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,517
and the printer will print them
on photo-quality paper.    

155
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,793
a plexiglass window protects the 15-inch monitor  

156
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,097
that's used for viewing and making selections.     

157
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,934
two other monitors fit in windowed panels     

158
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,335
on the outside of the cabin.  

159
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,471
the monitors all connect to the computer        

160
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,872
and show the same images at the same time,       

161
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,176
including what stage of development your picture is at.

162
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,415
they install a dispenser    

163
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,052
that sells optional cardboard frames for your portrait.   

164
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,558
money from these sales falls through a slot      

165
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,461
into a metal coin box inside the cabin.       

166
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,372
the dispenser holds up to 100 cardboard frames,  

167
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,374
each large enough to hold one portrait          

168
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,976
measuring 8 by 11 inches.   

169
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,444
if the dispenser is out,    

170
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,647
a sign reading "out of frames" drops into the tray.      

171
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,984
for security,         

172
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,120
the two doors enclosing the equipment    

173
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,588
each have two key locks,    

174
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,857
one at the top and one at the bottom.     

175
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:58,263
the worker installs four signs on the cabin roof.       

176
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,198
they're plexiglass boxes    

177
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,467
with vinyl posters and florescent lights.     

178
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,536
the cabin's curtain lets you make goofy faces in private,  

179
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,440
but is short enough to let people know you're in there.  

180
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,876
inside the cabin,       

181
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,478
the control panel helps you guide the camera.       

182
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,515
you press "up" or "down" to adjust the camera angle.  

183
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:27,425
then you choose one of three photos the camera has captured.

184
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,128
the computer bases its portrait
on this photo.         

185
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,834
you can tell it to make a caricature,         

186
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,502
a simulated work of art,    

187
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,939
or four small portraits in different artistic media.  

188
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,380
you can choose an oil painting,
a pencil sketch,        

189
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,384
or a drawing in charcoal or pastel.           

190
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,954
now you've got a masterpiece starring you.         

191
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,730
narrator: the world's first postage stamp      

192
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,333
was introduced in england in 1840            

193
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,269
as part of a major reform of the postal system.     

194
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,605
until then, the letter recipient
had to pay the postage.    

195
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,408
this first stamp was called the penny black        

196
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,943
because it cost one penny   

197
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,279
and featured queen victoria's profile    

198
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,580
on a black background.     

199
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:31,289
today's postage stamps feature all types of illustrations.  

200
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,891
a graphic artist produces a design concept,       

201
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,228
working the computer cursor like a paintbrush on canvas.  

202
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,631
the concept goes to the postal service's    

203
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,366
design authority for approval. 

204
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,635
once approved, the design goes to the printing company. 

205
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,771
the printer produces one type of stamp       

206
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,174
using two different types of printing presses,      

207
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,509
one of which requires an engraved printing plate.  

208
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,711
the company's master engraver 

209
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,715
draws his artistic interpretation of the concept 

210
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,918
using photographs of real subjects for inspiration.   

211
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,587
then he paints his drawing in watercolors.        

212
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,054
the shading is key       

213
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,191
because it indicates where the engraving will have depth. 

214
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,694
this helps him envision the end product.        

215
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,266
once he's happy with the result,

216
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,602
he scans the image into a computer        

217
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,239
and shrinks the digitized image
to the actual stamp size.   

218
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,148
then he lays a sheet of clear acetate over the reduction.  

219
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,883
with a tool called a point,  

220
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,819
he etches the main elements into the sheet.        

221
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,722
this etching process is known as scribing.          

222
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:54,172
now he tapes the scribed sheet onto a piece of soft steel.  

223
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,907
he lifts the sheet and coats the metal surface  

224
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,543
with beeswax.         

225
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,383
then he lays the sheet down again           

226
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,652
and, rubbing with a burnishing tool,    

227
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,588
transfers the scribed image to the wax coating.      

228
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,130
now, under a microscope that  
magnifies the image seven times,

229
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,397
he etches the design      

230
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,834
using what's called a pointing-in tool.      

231
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:32,243
then he sharpens another tool called a lozenge graver.    

232
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,948
with that, he deepens the etched lines  

233
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,682
of the design's focal point.  

234
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,017
this adds depth,        

235
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,020
which will make the deer appear
almost three-dimensional    

236
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,389
on the finished stamp.     

237
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,180
once complete, the engraving will be copied multiple times 

238
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,848
onto a plastic master plate.  

239
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,117
workers coat the plastic with silver          

240
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,453
so that it will conduct electricity,          

241
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,923
then submerge it into a bath containing baskets of nickel. 

242
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,327
they run an electrical current in both the bath and plate.  

243
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,396
this dissolves the nickel and draws it onto the plate  

244
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,065
in a thorough and even coat.  

245
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,569
with a nipping tool,      

246
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,939
workers remove the excess nickel
along the perimeter,      

247
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,675
then extract their nickel printing plate.     

248
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,477
then they plate the nickel plate
in chrome.           

249
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,815
now it's ready to go on to the intaglio printing press,  

250
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,618
a specialized machine used to print only select elements 

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,152
on certain types of stamps.  

252
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,688
we will explain why later.   

253
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,758
this machine, meanwhile,    

254
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,093
produces the templates     

255
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,228
for carving what are called chablons,   

256
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,096
the rollers on the intaglio press     

257
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,466
that transfer ink to the printing plates.    

258
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,503
here, the machine traces a pattern        

259
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,172
for one of the stamp's intaglio elements,       

260
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,842
guiding a router on the other end to reproduce it      

261
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:13,311
in half the size in thick plastic.       

262
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,785
at another machine, meanwhile, a worker makes the chablons.  

263
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,720
he takes several ingredients --

264
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,990
what they are is a closely guarded company secret --    

265
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,860
and pours them into a roller forming machine.   

266
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,796
the mix heats to about 350 degrees fahrenheit,    

267
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,664
and over about an hour and a half,      

268
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,667
it thickens and hardens.    

269
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,738
now an automated router machine
with multiple heads      

270
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,973
goes to work.         

271
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,676
following the plastic template,

272
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,878
the heads carve away at the rubber,         

273
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,015
leaving behind a raised design in the shape of the elements  

274
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,051
the intaglio press will print. 

275
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,889
it's this raised area that transfers the ink     

276
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,525
to the printing plate.     

277
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,302
narrator: why do they print some parts of a stamp     

278
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,470
using one type of press    

279
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,439
and other parts of it using another type?      

280
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,706
simple.            

281
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,109
off-set printing presses are widely available,     

282
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,978
so if the entire stamp will be printed using that technology, 

283
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,780
counterfeiters would have it easy.      

284
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,982
intaglio printing presses, on the other hand,       

285
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,853
are harder to come by, making fake stamps harder to produce. 

286
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,123
the sheets first run through the offset press.   

287
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,859
it prints one color at a time, 

288
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,862
making a separate printing plate
for each color.        

289
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,198
the plate is wrapped around a cylinder.       

290
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,399
as it revolves,        

291
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,935
the plate transfers or offsets the ink image         

292
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,471
to a rubber cylinder rotating against it.      

293
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,005
as that cylinder turns,    

294
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,242
it transfers the image to the paper passing underneath. 

295
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,147
a postal-service official inspects the press output.   

296
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,748
using a magnifying glass,   

297
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,818
she scrutinizes the color and print quality,       

298
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,553
circling any problem areas   

299
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,757
for the press operator to investigate and correct.  

300
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,831
now the offset printed sheets move on to the intaglio press. 

301
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,772
the intaglio's chablon rollers spread ink           

302
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,974
over the printing plate the factory produced      

303
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,308
from the engraving.      

304
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,978
the ink fills the recessed lines
of the image.         

305
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,981
the press runs the plate against the paper sheets,   

306
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,583
transferring the image.    

307
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,586
intaglio printing leaves the ink
slightly raised        

308
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,588
above the surface of the paper.

309
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,525
this gives the image height, a third dimension.       

310
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,199
once again, the inspector checks the result.       

311
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,135
it's up to the press operator to correct any error.     

312
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,605
the cause can be as complicated
as a printing plate problem  

313
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,341
or as simple as a speck of dirt
in the machine.        

314
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,412
the printing now done,     

315
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,347
a worker loads the stamp sheets

316
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,150
into a computer-guided perforating machine.      

317
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,687
grippers pull the sheets forward
one section at a time.     

318
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,095
down comes a die with rows of steel pins,         

319
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,830
each just a fraction of an inch
in diameter.          

320
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,499
they punch through the sheet, 

321
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,767
framing each stamp with tiny holes        

322
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,237
spaced less than 1/16 of an inch apart.       

323
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,440
the machine knows just where to punch these perforations   

324
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,675
by reading the line of florescent ink       

325
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,178
that runs along the borders of each stamp.         

326
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,646
this ink, called tagging,   

327
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,115
is visible only under ultraviolet light.       

328
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,184
tagging also plays a role later on.           

329
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,653
the automated machines that process mail       

330
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,923
at the sorting plants are programmed to scan for tagging.

331
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,192
they reject all envelopes without it.          

332
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,661
those letters are either missing a stamp        

333
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,463
or bear counterfeit postage.  

334
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,004
after stacking the perforated sheets,     

335
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,874
workers trim them down to the finished size,      

336
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,210
usually sheets of 10 called panes.         

337
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,545
their trimming machine     

338
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,080
is appropriately called the guillotine,        

339
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,482
but unlike the head-chopping version,   

340
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,419
this one slices with a sideways
shearing action.        

341
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,555
that puts less wear on the blade.         

342
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,828
the machine holds the stack in place            

343
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,363
with more than 8,800 pounds of pressure          

344
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,567
so that it doesn't budge under the weight of the blade. 

345
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,069
the blade rings in at almost 71 pounds.      

346
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,977
now it's time to group the panes
into manageable-sized packs  

347
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,580
for post offices and other stamp retailers.   

348
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,115
this machine is called a vacuumatic counter      

349
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,652
because it uses suction to draw the panes       

350
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,021
across a paddle wheel which counts them.       

351
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,795
this stack adds up to 503 panes,

352
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,733
so the worker removes three to make an even 500.      

353
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:06,837
the counter inserts a tab between every 50.       

354
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:12,209
some stamps go through what's called bursting,    

355
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,213
the process of manually separating pairs of stamps   

356
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,683
for different post office   
product lines such as gift sets.

357
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,886
some burst stamps go onto first day cover envelopes,   

358
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,488
one popular collector's item. 

359
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,690
an automated pad picks up the stamps           

360
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,893
and runs them against a wet roller      

361
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,361
that activates the adhesive on the back.          

362
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,698
after a worker positions an envelope          

363
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,032
against the guide bar,     

364
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,634
the pad places the stamps in a precise spot       

365
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,837
and applies even pressure over them           

366
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,573
so that they'll lay flat and adhere securely.      

367
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,311
many stamps are still the old lick-and-stick type  

368
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,112
printed on paper that's coated 

369
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,183
with a moisture-activated adhesive on the back side.   

370
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,519
however, the most commonly issued stamps,         

371
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,787
known as definitives,     

372
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,523
are printed on what's called pressure-sensitive paper.   

373
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,059
that's a technical term for peel-and-stick --     

374
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,662
no water or saliva required.  

375
