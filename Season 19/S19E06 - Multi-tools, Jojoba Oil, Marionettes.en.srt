1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,920
            narrator:           
   having a multi-tool on hand  

2
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,590
         is like having         
    a toolbox in your pocket.   

3
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:01,327
    it contains anywhere from   
    5 to 21 basic implements,   

4
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,565
 from screwdrivers and scissors 
   to can openers and pliers.   

5
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,600
    they all fold in and out    
 of the handles, forming a case 

6
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,572
      that's compact enough     
  to be carried in your pocket. 

7
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,944
         this multi-tool        
  contains 14 different tools,  

8
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,080
  including scissors, a knife,  

9
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,149
          wire cutters,         
      two types of pliers,      

10
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:28,287
  three different screwdrivers, 
         and much more.         

11
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,555
       most of these tools      

12
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,758
       and the handle into      
  which they conveniently fold  

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
  are made of stainless steel.  

14
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,896
  the strip of stainless steel  
        winds off a reel        

15
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,499
        and moves through       
     a 300-ton punch press.     

16
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,568
            it works            
   like a giant cookie cutter,  

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,104
   striking a series of dies    
   against the passing metal,   

18
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,441
   progressively stamping out,  
          in this case,         

19
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:52,178
  one part of the multi-tool's  
        two-part handle.        

20
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,582
        17 strikes later,       
        it's fully formed       

21
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,519
    and ready to go through     
    a heat-treatment process    

22
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,190
          to strengthen         
      the stainless steel.      

23
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:09,195
next, a polishing robot runs the
handle against a grinding wheel.

24
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:12,130
    it does so with specific    
      programmed movements      

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,535
 which produce a delicate lined 
 pattern on the metal surface.  

26
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,673
         certain tools,         
       like knife blades,       

27
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,207
    are made of premium steel   

28
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,077
 that is too hard for the press 
        to punch through,       

29
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,281
   so they have to be cut out   
   by a computer-guided laser.  

30
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,618
   the laser's heat literally   
    melts through the metal.    

31
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,025
    the knife blades go into    
      a polishing machine,      

32
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,763
where they vibrate among ceramic
    stones for several hours.   

33
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,032
        this smoothes out       
  the rough edges by abrasion.  

34
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,636
a magnet then removes the blades
        from the machine.       

35
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,972
        the knife blades,       
    still dull at this point,   

36
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,042
    go onto a motorized table   
  that runs them back and forth 

37
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,044
     under a grinding wheel.    

38
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,114
 this finalizes the dimensions. 

39
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,585
          the two jaws          
    that form the plier head    

40
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,054
       are cast in steel.       

41
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,124
      workers assemble them     
        with a spring...        

42
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,629
           ...a pin...          

43
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,332
         ...and a rivet.        

44
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,812
          then a robot          
 performs a two-stage polishing,

45
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,614
  first against a grinding belt 
      with the rough grit,      

46
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,616
          then against          
     one with a finer grit.     

47
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,887
    the plier head is at last   
      ready to be assembled     

48
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,557
       to the multi-tool's      
        two-part handle.        

49
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,226
      they align the holes      
          of the handle         

50
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:51,497
  with holes of the plier head, 
  slipping a spacer in between. 

51
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,432
         they put a pin         
       and screw fastener       

52
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:57,770
   through the aligned holes    
   to connect handle to head.   

53
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,045
  back to the knife blade now.  

54
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,382
  until this point, the blade's 
   cutting edge has been dull.  

55
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:14,386
     now a robot sharpens it    
  against two grinding wheels.  

56
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,722
  this is what the knife blade  
      looks like before...      

57
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,659
           and after.           

58
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,597
with the handle and all 14 tools
      formed, heat treated,     

59
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,134
  and polished, and the pliers  
    connected to the handles,   

60
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,136
   final assembly can begin --  

61
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:34,873
   the remaining tools stacked  
 together inside the two handles

62
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,309
  with the stainless-steel ring 
  to fill up the excess width.  

63
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,816
   the assemblers thread a rod  
       all the way through      

64
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:46,818
      the holes of the base     
     of the handle and tools    

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,622
      to hold the alignment     
   until they secure the setup  

66
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,091
  with the stainless-steel pin  
           and rivet.           

67
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,892
    they repeat this process    

68
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,161
       in the other handle      
    with the remaining tools,   

69
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,763
   except for the knife blade   
          and scissors,         

70
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,499
       which go in later.       

71
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,568
     they apply a few drops     
         of thread lock         

72
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,437
     to immobilize the pins     
         in each handle.        

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,307
a bronze washer makes the handle
     housing the knife blade    

74
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,911
open smoothly to prevent injury.

75
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,780
   they install a safety cover  
       on that same handle      

76
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,751
    to shield the sharp knife   
      when it's not in use.     

77
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,324
   now the knife blade itself.  

78
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,129
     they rivet the scissors    
      to the other handle,      

79
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,599
  and the assembly is finished. 

80
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,204
    this multi-tool, with its   
    14 different implements,    

81
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:41,073
    is ready to be folded up    
     and tucked in a pocket     

82
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:46,045
    or unfolded, offering up    
  the right tool for the task.  

83
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,298
      narrator: jojoba oil      
     isn't actually an oil.     

84
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,835
     it's a liquid wax from     
  the seed of the jojoba plant, 

85
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,038
  native to the sonoran desert  
        areas in arizona,       

86
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,373
     california, and mexico.    

87
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,242
          jojoba oil is         
  a common ingredient in soaps, 

88
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:21,446
     shampoos, moisturizers,    
    eye makeup, lip products,   

89
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,449
      and color cosmetics.      

90
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:29,054
     cosmetics manufacturers    
     buy refined jojoba oil     

91
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,123
   from a processing facility.  

92
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,991
   jojoba in its natural state  

93
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,462
            is golden           
 and has a slightly nutty odor. 

94
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:40,165
once refined, it can be rendered
     colorless and odorless.    

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,471
         the jojoba farm        
     takes selected cuttings    

96
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:48,741
   from mature jojoba shrubs,   
      roots and grows them      

97
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,076
    for 18 months to 2 years    
        in a greenhouse,        

98
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,079
      then transplants them     
        into the fields.        

99
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,883
     the wind carries pollen    

100
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:01,219
      from the male plants      
   to fertilize female plants,  

101
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,823
   after which the female seed  
       starts developing.       

102
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,892
       each seed is housed      
          inside a hull         

103
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,361
    that gradually dries out    
         and separates,         

104
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,231
dropping the seed to the ground.

105
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,701
        the fallen seeds        
     are mature for harvest.    

106
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:19,104
 the mechanical harvester works 
  like a giant vacuum cleaner,  

107
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,306
        sucking the seeds       
         off the ground,        

108
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,110
    along with a lot of sand,   
        twigs, and rocks.       

109
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,183
  the harvester then dumps its  
 collection into a large hopper 

110
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,853
     that feeds an elaborate    
     seed-cleaning machine.     

111
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:40,859
   in it, the seeds and debris  
 move from conveyor to conveyor 

112
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,929
        through a series        
      of vibrating screens,     

113
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,532
            each made           
  of increasingly smaller mesh. 

114
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,734
 the process gradually sifts out

115
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:52,071
    smaller and smaller bits    
          of debris...          

116
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,891
     ...until only the seeds    
            are left.           

117
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,894
          they go into          
     huge polyethylene bags,    

118
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:22,034
then off to the processing plant
  where workers empty the bags  

119
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,838
       into a holding area      
       called a seed pit.       

120
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,574
      from here, conveyors      
 take the seeds to the presses. 

121
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,511
   the liquid wax is contained  
  within the hard, white flesh, 

122
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,446
      called the cotyledon.     

123
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:40,652
 they expel the liquid wax with 
  conventional expeller press.  

124
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,988
      a long screw conveyor     
 feeds the seeds into the press,

125
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,859
        then crushes them       
        against a shaft.        

126
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,994
 this forces out the liquid wax 

127
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,064
          that makes up         
   about half a seed's weight.  

128
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:01,339
 the mashed seed-solids, called 
   cake, are put to good use.   

129
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,609
   some are used for compost.   

130
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:07,212
     some will be processed     
       into exfoliates --       

131
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,214
         abrasives used         
    in face and body products   

132
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,183
   to remove dead skin cells.   

133
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,086
           meanwhile,           
     a second screw conveyor    

134
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:17,622
  moves the expelled liquid wax 
    into a holding container,   

135
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:22,961
and from there, a pump pushes it
     through a filter press.    

136
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:26,498
       this press consists      
  of several plates and frames, 

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,035
        each one covered        
      with a filter cloth.      

138
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,437
        as the liquid wax       
         passes through,        

139
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,309
        the cloth catches       
   the last remaining solids.   

140
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:40,445
 this buildup of seed particles 
     and other minute debris    

141
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,382
     is biodegradable waste.    

142
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:47,920
  to make exfoliates, machines  
 grind the cake into particles, 

143
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,924
  then vibrating sifters divide 
     the particles by size.     

144
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:57,128
  what's too big or small goes  
  back to the farm for compost. 

145
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,465
    the extracted liquid wax    
    isn't yet fully refined.    

146
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,333
it's still cloudy and yellowish,

147
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,470
           so workers           
add natural powdered absorbents,

148
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,272
      then filter them out.     

149
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,343
  this clarifies the jojoba oil 
     to its finished state.     

150
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:16,014
 the company lab runs extensive 
 quality tests on every batch.  

151
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,484
           technicians          
    analyze several criteria,   

152
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:22,220
     including color, odor,     
    and chemical composition,   

153
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,625
     ensuring the oil meets     
 strict product specifications. 

154
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,627
        as the jojoba oil       

155
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,829
    flows from storage tanks    
      into shipping drums,      

156
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,833
    it passes through a final   
ultra-sensitive cartridge filter

157
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,634
          that removes          
      any minute particles      

158
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,972
     that might have slipped    
    through the filter press.   

159
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,774
         this processor         

160
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,111
       makes two varieties      
    of refined jojoba oil --    

161
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,446
           one golden,          
    with a mild, nutty aroma,   

162
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,251
           the other,           
     colorless and odorless.    

163
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,720
   the texture and consistency  
         are identical.         

164
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,989
          manufacturers         
      buy whichever variety     

165
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,957
   better suits their product.  

166

   narrator: string puppets,    
   also known as marionettes,   

167
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,745
       are an ancient form      
         of performance.        

168
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,881
     it's not known exactly     
          when or where         

169
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,284
    the first string puppets    
       made an appearance,      

170
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,018
           but it was           
     thousands of years ago.    

171
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,354
    today, they've still got    
          what it takes         

172
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,657
     to entertain audiences     
           worldwide.           

173
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,160
     [ circus music plays ]     

174
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,364
      digitized characters      
     may rule in the movies,    

175
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,834
  but onstage, there's no doubt 
    that string-animated ones   

176
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,170
   can still dazzle audiences.  

177
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,840
         a few movements        
    of the puppeteer's hands,   

178
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:53,979
 and some fantastical characters
      are brought to life.      

179
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,313
       behind the scenes,       

180
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,650
    making these marionettes    
     is a major production.     

181
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,987
    each one is painstakingly   
          hand-crafted          

182
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:03,722
 in a process that takes weeks. 

183
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,526
   it all starts with an idea.  

184
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:12,264
 the puppet maker draws several 
   sketches of the character,   

185
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,933
      tweaking the features     
      until he's satisfied.     

186
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:19,671
   he then draws a full-scale   
   version of the marionette.   

187
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,341
          referring to          
      that scaled drawing,      

188
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:24,209
  he sculpts the head in clay,  

189
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:28,813
    building it into a wooden   
framework known as the armature.

190
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,148
     the clay is oil-based.     

191
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,218
       it doesn't dry out       
as fast as the water-based kind,

192
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,521
    so there's time to tweak    
  the sculpture and perfect it. 

193
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,156
    lines drawn for reference   

194
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:42,360
   make it easier to position   
   the nose, eyes, and mouth.   

195
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,962
      he defines the mouth      
          a little more         

196
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,698
           to give it           
     a petulant expression.     

197
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,166
           he smoothes          
    the top of the clay head,   

198
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:52,170
  using a looped sculpting tool 
         and his thumb.         

199
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,240
      with a caliper tool,      
     he constantly compares     

200
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,242
  the dimensions of the sketch  
        to the sculpture        

201
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:02,581
 to ensure the head won't end up
     too large or too small.    

202
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:06,518
once the lips and other features
     have been smoothed out,    

203
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,855
       he prepares to make      
a plaster mold of the sculpture.

204
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,457
       he divides the head      
       into four sections,      

205
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,326
   and he outlines a trap door  
     at the back of the head    

206
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,330
     for easy access later.     

207
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:22,133
      he now inserts metal      
 shims along the dividing lines.

208
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:28,806
 he's essentially building walls
   to contain molding plaster.  

209
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,143
   the shims will also ensure   
that the plaster, once hardened,

210
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,748
  can be removed from the clay  
sculpture in four intact pieces.

211
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:43,688
  the plaster has been mixed to 
 the consistency of cake batter.

212
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,290
   he scoops a generous amount  

213
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,427
    into a walled-in section    
     of the clay sculpture.     

214
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,833
   the plaster generates heat   
     as it hardens and sets.    

215
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,003
          it then cools         
     for about half an hour.    

216
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:05,110
           he removes           
   the shims that surround it.  

217
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:11,182
    he then uses those shims    
  to wall-in the next section.  

218
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:15,821
he adds more plaster to build up
     this part of the mold.     

219
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,459
     when all four sections     
          are complete,         

220
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,263
     he gently chisels them     
 at the seams to separate them. 

221
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:28,333
        he opens the mold       
   and removes the sculpture.   

222
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:32,270
 its image has been transferred 
   to the inside of the mold.   

223
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,805
          the sculpture         
      is no longer needed,      

224
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:38,209
     and he's ready to cast     
the puppet head, using the mold.

225
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,813
        for that, he uses       
 plastic-infused cloth squares, 

226
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,081
      softened by solvent.      

227
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,752
    he transfers the squares    
      to the mold sections      

228
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:50,756
         and layers them        
       papier-mâché style.      

229
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:53,358
         a release agent        
       applied to the mold      

230
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,894
        keeps the squares       
       from sticking to it      

231
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,030
   as they begin to adhere to   
each other, and, in the process,

232
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,233
      conform to the mold's     
      curves and crevices.      

233
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,570
    with squares now applied    
      to all four sections,     

234
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,374
 he puts the mold back together 
  and joins them at the seams.  

235
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:13,244
         after 10 hours,        
  it's time for the big reveal. 

236
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:18,249
  all those little squares are  
 now one solid marionette head. 

237
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,920
 the casting looks pretty rough 
         at this point,         

238
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,458
 so he covers the entire surface
       with plastic wood.       

239
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,166
        what a difference       
 sanding the plastic wood makes.

240
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,467
     he then paints the head    

241
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:39,471
         and cuts holes         
     for the eyes and mouth.    

242
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:42,740
  from the inside of the puppet 
    head, he attaches springs   

243
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:47,045
  to enable the mouth and eyes  
       to open and close.       

244
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,754
  over in the paint department, 
 with every stroke of the brush,

245
00:15:55,756 --> 00:16:00,291
       the puppet becomes       
   a more colorful character.   

246
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,161
 coming up next, the marionette 
     gets its moving parts,     

247
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,999
         and, of course,        
they come with strings attached.

248
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:28,787
         narrator: with         
  their string-operated limbs,  

249
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,057
 marionettes can imitate almost 
 every human or animal gesture. 

250
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,127
   the more joints and strings  
         the puppet has,        

251
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,797
 the wider the range of movement

252
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,334
     and the more lifelike      
     the character becomes.     

253
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,007
         before the head        
      of the penguin puppet     

254
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,609
  can be attached to the body,  

255
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:54,012
          it just needs         
  a few more dramatic touches,  

256
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,014
         like curly fur.        

257
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,416
    yes, in the fantasy world   
          of puppetry,          

258
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:02,086
     anything is possible --    
     even fur on a penguin.     

259
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:06,090
  he traces the pattern on the  
reverse side of the furry fabric

260
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,359
         and cuts it out        
      from that side, too,      

261
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,229
    to prevent any snipping     
    of the fur on the front.    

262
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,431
 he stitches the darts together 

263
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,167
     to conform to the shape    
      of the penguin head.      

264
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:22,907
  this process must be repeated 
   for each fur-covered part.   

265
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,909
      he checks out the fit     

266
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,647
  and confirms that it achieves 
       the desired effect.      

267
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:36,187
   satisfied with the results,  
  he moves on to the eyelashes. 

268
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:40,859
   he traces the pattern onto   
 rubber and cuts the lashes out.

269
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:45,463
     to accentuate the eyes,    
   the lashes are substantial.  

270
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,805
he inserts a pair of lashes into
  slits in each wooden eyeball. 

271
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:58,276
        from head to toe,       
    no detail is overlooked.    

272
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,946
   here, he glues rhinestones   
            to shoes            

273
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:03,782
 for some serious onstage bling.

274
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,420
     he's now ready to build    

275
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,490
       the torso and limbs      
       of the marionette.       

276
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:16,428
 he traces the pattern of those 
parts onto blocks of poplar wood

277
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,297
and then carefully cuts them out
        with a band saw.        

278
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,936
 this particular part is a hand 
   for the penguin character.   

279
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:35,380
         the initial cut        
 is rough and needs fine-tuning,

280
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,382
    so he chisels away at it    

281
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,118
      to remove excess wood     
      and define the shape.     

282
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,958
     he files it with a rasp    
      to round the profile.     

283
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:55,133
    it takes about five hours   
to produce just one puppet hand.

284
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,869
     the other parts receive    
  an equal amount of attention, 

285
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,538
          because with          
  ball-and-socket-style joints, 

286
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,875
   each limb must fit smoothly  
          to the next.          

287
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,945
       he attaches the two      
   limb segments with a hinge   

288
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,347
            made from           
    a kind of fiber board --    

289
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,686
        the same material       
  used to make steamer trunks.  

290
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:19,324
he confirms that the joints will
 move freely under the costume. 

291
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,365
    when the marionette body    
    has all its moving parts,   

292
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,135
            it's time           
     to stretch those limbs.    

293
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,771
       so they suit him up      

294
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,773
     and thread the strings     
         from the puppet        

295
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,243
       to the correct spot      
        on the controls.        

296
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,579
        the control bars        
  are shaped like an airplane.  

297
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,582
  they're known in the world of 
puppetry as an airplane control.

298
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:49,987
 the thread they use is fishing 
 line because of its strength.  

299
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,589
 they run nine strings or more, 

300
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,726
   depending on the complexity  
       of the marionette.       

301
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:58,129
    some of these strings are   
 for support, some for movement,

302
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:03,067
   and others for effects like  
  nose growing or ear wiggling. 

303
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,871
 of course, the string placement
 is crucial for proper movement.

304
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,073
     with the strings strung    
        and well knotted,       

305
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,076
       the marionette body      
         comes to life.         

306
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,712
  and now the defining moment.  

307
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,148
      they attach the head      
          to the body.          

308
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,150
        it's a good fit.        

309
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,154
  this new character is almost  
  ready to meet his audience.   

310
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,292
         all that's left        
      is to run the strings     

311
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:33,030
    for controlling his head    
    and facial expressions.     

312
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,800
   and a little accessorizing.  

313
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,974
 they now manipulate the strings
   to check his limb dexterity  

314
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:46,644
 and the movement of his mouth, 
       eyes, and eyebrows.      

315
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,848
         this marionette        
   is now ready for the stage.  

316
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,651
   between shows, he reclines.  

317
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:57,855
           after all,           
     you can't always be on.    

318
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,325
           incredibly,          
   it takes up to 1,500 hours   

319
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,229
            to create           
 each one of these marionettes. 

320
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,606
      after all that work,      
they're ready to cue the talent.
