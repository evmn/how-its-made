00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,436
around a flask-shaped aluminum

removes the block.              
he fuses the edges by running a

he fuses the edges by running a

entire length of the joint.     
meanwhile, on another press,    
workers stamp out pewter-sheet

00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,061
workers stamp out pewter-sheet  
rectangles.                     
the metalsmith solders one      

66
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,529
rectangles.                     
the metalsmith solders one      
rectangle to the top of the

00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,332
the metalsmith solders one      
rectangle to the top of the

with jeweler scissors.          

70
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,543
then cuts it to the right shape 
with jeweler scissors.          
next, he solders on a pewter    

71
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,345
with jeweler scissors.          
next, he solders on a pewter    
thread for the cap.             

72
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,628
before fusing a pewter rectangle
to the bottom of the flask, he  
stamps it with a maker's mark.  

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,497
to the bottom of the flask, he  
stamps it with a maker's mark.  
then he dabs the bottom of the  

74
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,431
stamps it with a maker's mark.  
then he dabs the bottom of the  
flask in flux, a chemical which 

75
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,034
then he dabs the bottom of the  
flask in flux, a chemical which 
helps solder run smoothly       

76
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,101
flask in flux, a chemical which 
helps solder run smoothly       
without globs.

helps solder run smoothly       
without globs.                  
then, just as he did with the   

78
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:02,508
without globs.                  
then, just as he did with the   
top, he solders on the bottom,  

79
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,376
then, just as he did with the   
top, he solders on the bottom,  
then contours it.               

80
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,458
next, he puts a drill through   
the cap thread and bores a hole 
for filling and boring.         

81
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,593
the cap thread and bores a hole 
for filling and boring.         
then, with an abrasive belt, he 

82
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,461
for filling and boring.         
then, with an abrasive belt, he 
grinds all the solder seams     

83
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,096
then, with an abrasive belt, he 
grinds all the solder seams     
flat, making them barely        

84
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,499
grinds all the solder seams     
flat, making them barely        
noticeable.                     

85
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,234
flat, making them barely        
noticeable.                     
workers now fill the finished   

86
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,936
noticeable.                     
workers now fill the finished   
flask with water to check for   

87
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,437
workers now fill the finished   
flask with water to check for   
leaks and rinse out the         

88
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:39,611
flask with water to check for   
leaks and rinse out the         
interior.                       

89
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,213
leaks and rinse out the         
interior.                       
then they screw a pewter cap    

90
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:48,587
interior.                       
then they screw a pewter cap    
onto each thread.               

91
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,823
then they screw a pewter cap    
onto each thread.               
now a buffer takes over.        

92
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,758
onto each thread.               
now a buffer takes over.        
with a cloth wheel and pumice,

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,226
now a buffer takes over.        
with a cloth wheel and pumice,  
he removes any surface          

94
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,027
with a cloth wheel and pumice,  
he removes any surface          
imperfections, such as marks    

95
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,929
he removes any surface          
imperfections, such as marks    
left by the abrasive belt they

00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,765
imperfections, such as marks    
left by the abrasive belt they  
used earlier to grind down the

00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:05,637

used earlier to grind down the

98
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,373
used earlier to grind down the  
solder seams.                   
once the buffing's complete, the
