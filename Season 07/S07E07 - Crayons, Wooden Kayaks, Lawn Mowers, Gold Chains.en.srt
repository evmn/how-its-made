00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,291
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,193
crayons...           

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,966
...wooden kayaks...      

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,772
...lawn mowers...       

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,411
...and gold chains.      

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
crayons are a popular drawing tool     

9
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,721
for today's young artists.   

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,524
the average north american kid uses 730 of them        

11
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,859
by the age of 10.       

12
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,996
an american chemical company invented crayons in 1903.   

13
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,464
it took the basic wax crayon it already made        

14
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,999
for marking crates and barrels 

15
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,734
and came up with a nontoxic version    

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,071
in different colors.      

17
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,411
these crayons are made from a combination of waxes -- 

18
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,414
primarily paraffin, which is ideal for making crayons    

19
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,217
because it's inexpensive and easy to melt.       

20
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,286
it also has what's called a nice rub-off,        

21
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:31,056
meaning it leaves enough wax on the paper.         

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,362
they melt the wax at 143 degrees fahrenheit.   

23
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,099
then add a secret powder to strengthen the crayon    

24
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,101
and act as a filler,      

25
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,370
boosting the number of crayons the wax will produce.     

26
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,776
they also add various synthetic chemicals --     

27
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,378
there's one to keep the wax from sticking to the mold...  

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,051
and a fatty acid, called stearic
acid, to improve the rub-off. 

29
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,652
now they tint the wax --    

30
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:05,924
in this case, yellow and red to produce orange crayons.   

31
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,727
this factory can produce 127 different colors.     

32
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,998
every ingredient in the crayons is nontoxic.  

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,667
after adding more wax,     

34
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,104
they blend the mixture for about 45 minutes.      

35
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,845
now they pump the wax into this
device called a rotary machine.

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:37,222
it first injects the wax into crayon-shaped molds.   

37
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,625
then it envelops the molds in cool water,         

38
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,828
hardening the wax within roughly a minute.    

39
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,839
as the molds continue along the circuit,          

40
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:58,376
a blade scrapes off the excess,
which gets recycled.      

41
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,578
just one rotary machine    

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,715
molds more than 2,700 crayons per cycle.           

43
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,918
with several machines operating simultaneously,   

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,290
this factory churns out 30,000 crayons per hour.    

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,474
the machine ejects the crayons,

46
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,478
and a conveyor transports them to the labeling machine.    

47
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:41,086
one by one, they drop into   
the grooves of a revolving drum.

48
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,221
at the bottom left,      

49
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,756
a gluer coats the surface in between the grooves     

50
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,960
just before the crayons go in. 

51
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,298
the machine then slaps a label onto each crayon.       

52
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,501
a roller presses the label against the adhesive,     

53
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:01,973
then a little arm wraps it around the crayon.  

54
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:06,979
this machine labels 8,500 crayons per hour.    

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,903
the crayons exit the labeling machine and land in a bulk box.

56
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,476
workers sort the crayons by color            

57
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,679
into the appropriate hoppers of the packing machine.    

58
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,349
the packaging line is entirely automated.     

59
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,018
the factory programs the machine

60
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,154
to collect a certain number of crayons in specific colors 

61
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,957
according to the type of pack in production.     

62
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,560
their best sellers are packs of 16 and 24.    

63
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,434
the packing machine is designed
to handle the crayons gently. 

64
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,435
occasionally, though,     

65
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,239
a crayon does crack or a label comes loose.    

66
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,175
when that happens, a sensor automatically stops the machine

67
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,844
and a light goes on above the problem hopper.   

68
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,581
workers clear the jam, then production resumes.    

69
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,856
once the count is complete,  

70
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,794
the crayon line and the box line meet.     

71
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:33,932
a pushing device slides each set of crayons into a box.

72
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,535
a built-in scale weighs every box.       

73
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,002
should one be underweight,   

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,872
the machine automatically blows
it off the conveyor belt.   

75
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,608
a worker then manually adds the missing crayon,    

76
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,080
ensuring a full complement of 
colors for every budding artist.

77
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,624
narrator: for thousands of years,    

78
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,761
aboriginal people in the arctic
have used kayaks to hunt    

79
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,095
and for good reason.      

80
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,764
these slender vessels glide swiftly in the water   

81
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,366
and are light enough to carry. 

82
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,702
high-tech materials make today's wooden kayaks   

83
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,970
more durable than ever,    

84
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,106
but its shape and performance in the water  

85
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,241
are basically the same.    

86
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,983
it starts with plywood made from okoume --      

87
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,985
a rugged type of mahogany.   

88
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,720
a computer-guided routing machine        

89
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,922
cuts out the boat's various parts.         

90
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,592
one has finger joints that interlock with another piece  

91
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,329
to make one long strip.    

92
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:39,998
these panels will cover the sides of the vessel    

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,866
and most of the top.      

94
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,134
the planks are so thin --   

95
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,336
just a little over an eighth of an inch --    

96
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,208
that the entire kayak will weigh only 37 1/2 pounds. 

97
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,879
then there are bulkheads, end panels, footrests,     

98
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:57,549
and curved pieces to support the deck and sides. 

99
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,822
after applying two coats of epoxy resin,        

100
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,290
a craftsman assembles the parts

101
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,494
and secures them in a jig for six hours until the glue sets. 

102
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,563
the side panels will span the entire length of the boat, 

103
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,832
at just over 16 1/2 feet.   

104
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,368
assembling the kayak is pretty straightforward,   

105
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,704
so if you want to save money and do it yourself,      

106
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:24,376
you can buy this kayak cheaper as a kit.       

107
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:28,246
he planes and sands the end panels to create a curved tip. 

108
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,491
he drills small holes spaced 4 3/4 inches apart   

109
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:43,194
along the edges of the bottom panels.     

110
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,397
then he threads copper wire through the holes.       

111
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,332
this stitches the panels together temporarily,     

112
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,601
keeping them flexible     

113
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,871
and thereby easy to assemble for gluing.          

114
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,943
he places wooden pegs between the side panels    

115
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,346
to pry them open...      

116
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,949
then joins those panels    

117
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,487
with two screws in the front and two in the back.      

118
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,423
at this stage, the kayak is upside down,   

119
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,758
so they add the bottom panels. 

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,560
he attaches them with copper wire        

121
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,896
because it won't stick to the resin he'll use     

122
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,665
to glue these parts together. 

123
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,243
after flipping the boat,    

124
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,712
he attaches a bulkhead with more wire.        

125
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,650
it's one of two separators that
create stowage compartments.  

126
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,785
using a putty knife as a gauge,

127
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,920
he ensures the gaps at the seams are even,     

128
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,524
then he flips the boat and coats the seams in resin. 

129
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,795
he lets it dry for 6 hours,  

130
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,599
just part of the 40 hours it takes to build the kayak.  

131
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,870
before the glue hardens,    

132
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,373
he makes sure the top of the boat is level. 

133
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:06,011
this way, he can adjust the pieces if he needs to.   

134
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,413
after removing the wire from the seams,        

135
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,016
he applies more resin to these areas.        

136
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:15,220
over this, strips of fiberglass 
cloth to form a watertight seal.

137
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,689
he'll also apply three more coats of resin   

138
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,592
throughout the inside of the kayak.         

139
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:29,501
once it dries, and he sands and
varnishes the entire surface, 

140
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,236
the craftsman adds the footrest assembly.  

141
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,772
this one's got pivot pads   

142
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,508
with cables that control    
a rudder to help steer the boat.

143
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,777
this is an optional feature.  

144
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,312
otherwise, there's a simple foot brace,  

145
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,049
and you just use your paddle. 

146
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,124
next, craftsmen apply resin along the kayak's upper rim.  

147
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,660
they add the top panel to form the deck,       

148
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,329
then they wrap the entire boat in packing tape,        

149
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:03,468
which compresses the panels as the resin sets for 12 hours.

150
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,338
these pieces form a raised rim around where the kayaker sits. 

151
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,540
a waterproof skirt fits under this rim,      

152
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:13,077
keeping the area dry in the water.         

153
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,480
the deck gets two coats of resin.    

154
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,149
an hour later, they spread fiberglass over the bottom   

155
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,484
to seal and protect the wood. 

156
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,755
the bottom then gets three coats of resin.     

157
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,229
next, they spray on up to six coats of varnish,  

158
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,232
depending on the type of finish
the boat will have.      

159
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,635
this protects the wood from sun damage.        

160
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,237
they add a foam backrest    

161
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,040
and a seat for your comfort on the trek. 

162
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,447
and finally, flexible rubber straps --   

163
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,050
they're for securing your paddle
to the kayak.         

164
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:55,020
now it's off to the water.   

165
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,064
narrator: gardeners' jobs got much easier in 1830    

166
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,335
with the invention of     
the first mechanical lawn mower.

167
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,839
nowadays, most lawn mowers have
electric motors or gas engines.

168
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,209
they turn blades that are either
on a reel and cut like scissors 

169
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,746
or rotate like a propeller to chop the grass.       

170
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,819
these gas mowers have rotary blades       

171
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:33,691
that spin horizontally on a vertical crankshaft.   

172
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,895
to make the blade housing, which is called the deck,    

173
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,497
a machine first applies a lubricating chemical     

174
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,834
to sheet steel, which was coiled
when it came to the factory.  

175
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,904
the chemical helps flatten it so it's easier to cut.     

176
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,042
a press then perforates the sheet every 2 feet.    

177
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,713
after the press separates the segments     

178
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,382
and rounds off the corners,  

179
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:02,587
a robotic arm moves each segment onto a die. 

180
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,924
a 500-ton press bends the steel
like tinfoil between two molds 

181
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,295
to give the deck its basic shape.        

182
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,669
a robot lifts the oily decks with suction cups       

183
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,739
and moves them to another press.

184
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,615
this machine trims away the excess around the deck's edges.

185
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,158
another machine bends the sharp bottom lip inward  

186
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,427
to make the deck safer to handle.        

187
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,631
the factory uses robots because
they work faster than humans, 

188
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,867
processing 500 decks an hour. 

189
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,305
after a thorough cleaning,   

190
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,174
the decks move into an electrostatic-paint booth. 

191
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,044
they lace the powder paint   
with a negative electric charge,

192
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,246
the decks with a positive one. 

193
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,582
this draws the paint particles onto the decks,        

194
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,652
creating a thorough and even coat.         

195
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,455
the factory's six paint booths are on tracks         

196
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,190
so when it's time to change color,        

197
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:17,128
workers can easily switch the entire chamber for a clean one.

198
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,500
the paint cures at 374 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes.   

199
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,338
this press bends 8-foot-long tubing       

200
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,741
to form the mower's upper handle.         

201
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,614
another press bends 6-foot-long tubes       

202
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,883
to make a shorter, lower handle.

203
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,485
workers will later attach the two handles        

204
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,087
to form one folding handle.  

205
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,957
by folding, it takes up less space in the shipping box 

206
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,929
and, later, in your garage.  

207
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,435
here's the mower's 5-horsepower engine.      

208
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:01,839
a worker attaches it to the deck
with three bolts.       

209
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,240
he uses a powerful torque gun 

210
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,643
so the bolts won't loosen because of vibrations.     

211
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,979
later, workers will mount the blades     

212
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,981
to the engine's crankshaft   

213
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,984
that protrudes through an opening in the deck.

214
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,056
next, workers install a plastic rear door,      

215
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,993
through which the grass clippings eject.   

216
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,528
this door attaches to brackets,

217
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,663
which have levers that adjust the mower     

218
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,999
to nine different height positions.       

219
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,879
it's time to mount the plastic rear wheels.    

220
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,282
next an adaptor to stabilize the blade on the crankshaft,  

221
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,351
then the blade.        

222
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,851
it's wider at each end     

223
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,522
to create the proper airflow inside the deck.        

224
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,630
they secure the blade tightly with a powerful wrench     

225
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:03,167
because it's going to spin at 3,300 rpm.         

226
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,236
the front wheels are 1/3 smaller
than the back ones.      

227
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:11,242
this makes the mower easier  
to maneuver over uneven terrain.

228
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,911
they put rubber covers on the height-adjustment levers

229
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,780
so they're softer on the fingers.        

230
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,182
the mower adjusts from 1 inch 

231
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,786
to nearly 3 1/2 inches off the ground.        

232
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,921
they secure the lower handle, 

233
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,590
then loosely attach the upper handle to the lower one.    

234
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,360
the consumer can tighten this after shipping.        

235
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,933
they add a safety handle that turns the engine off   

236
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,535
if you're not squeezing it against the upper handle.    

237
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,203
it attaches to a caliper system,

238
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,440
much like what you'd find on a bicycle.         

239
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,816
finally, workers apply labels 

240
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,352
to indicate the mower's horsepower and width.     

241
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,990
fill it up with gas, and it's ready to give your lawn a trim.

242
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,502
narrator: some of the first gold chains 

243
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,304
date back to the ancient cultures of iraq and greece.  

244
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,041
they were symbols of wealth, royalty, and the divine.    

245
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,445
lucky for us, jewelers now make these personal treasures 

246
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,780
more affordable and more durable than ever.  

247
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,916
but you may be surprised to learn what they put in the gold

248
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,885
to make it better.       

249
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,394
pure gold is fairly soft and bright yellow,       

250
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,930
so it's common to create an alloy to strengthen it   

251
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:39,997
and alter its color.      

252
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,534
copper lends a reddish hue.  

253
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,471
and brass helps the alloy melt more quickly than gold  

254
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,805
and copper would alone.    

255
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,607
depending on the ratio,    

256
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:54,078
adding these metals produces 14- or 18-karat gold.     

257
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,282
they melt the mix in a crucible
at 1,850 degrees fahrenheit.  

258
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,817
just three of these scoops   

259
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:04,889
are enough to make about 5,000 14-karat-gold chains.     

260
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,697
a worker pours the molten alloy
into a casting machine.    

261
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,235
water cools the metal to around 700 degrees fahrenheit, 

262
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,169
solidifying it.        

263
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,038
the metal passes through a round die          

264
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,174
which shapes it into a golden rod       

265
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,510
that's nearly 6 1/2 feet long. 

266
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,448
after cutting the rod in half, 

267
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,718
workers pass it through what's called a breakdown mill.

268
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,187
the machine reshapes the rod from round to square      

269
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:40,658
so it will be easier to stretch.

270
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,199
next stop -- a tandem mill.  

271
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,567
it's got 12 rollers that stretch the rod      

272
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,004
until it's about as thin as a piece of spaghetti.    

273
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,207
as it emerges, rollers shape the rod into a coil      

274
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:59,177
that's nearly 78 feet long.  

275
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,084
workers soften the coiled metal
in an oven.          

276
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,490
then they uncoil and continue stretching what's now a wire  

277
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,826
by passing it through a die lined with industrial diamonds.

278
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,894
to prevent overheating,    

279
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,963
the machine sprays lubricant to cool the wire        

280
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,632
while reducing it to the width of a human hair --

281
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,700
its final size.        

282
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:31,476
the wire then winds into a spool
that's over 1 1/2 miles long. 

283
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,847
next, they unwind 32 of the spools         

284
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,516
and run the wires through another oven      

285
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,118
to soften them even more.   

286
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,387
just in case you're thinking about walking off       

287
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,655
with some of them,       

288
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,657
you should know that security is very tight.         

289
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,992
employees must pass through metal detectors        

290
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,261
before going home,       

291
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:54,465
and wearing jewelry to work is strictly forbidden.     

292
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,735
this machine makes what's called cable chain.   

293
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,870
it passes wire through a link and closes it  

294
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,138
to make another link.     

295
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,242
the machine makes 600 links per minute.          

296
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,449
here, a worker does a random quality check.  

297
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,223
this machine makes a chain in what's called a venetian style.

298
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,892
the wire passes through a channel           

299
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,960
where mechanical jaws bend it over a die       

300
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:25,563
to make a link with the preceding segment.  

301
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,703
to make what's called a spider style,        

302
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,506
this machine passes a wire through up to five loops    

303
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,942
before closing the link.    

304
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,516
for a figaro-style chain,   

305
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,452
this machine makes three short links    

306
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,722
before a mechanical arm moves the chain to another area   

307
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,660
to add one longer link.    

308
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,263
the arm then moves it back to add three more short links. 

309
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,072
the simplest style is what's called a rope chain. 

310
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,274
to make it, this machine threads a wire  

311
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,809
through as many as two loops  

312
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:16,047
then closes it to make another loop.     

313
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,420
they coat the finished chains with a lubricating powder   

314
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,889
that prevents the links from sticking to each other  

315
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,189
during the next step,     

316
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:30,694
when they heat the chains to 1,500 degrees fahrenheit.  

317
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,431
this activates a soldering agent
added to the metals earlier.  

318
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,602
it fuses the ends of the links to each other.         

319
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:45,042
this machine welds a link to a clasp on the chain.    

320
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,312
a tag indicating the gold quality goes onto the clasp.  

321
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,448
finally, the chains go through four chemical baths,

322
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,317
which thoroughly clean them,  

323
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,255
then workers plate them with  
a layer of 14- or 18-karat gold.

324
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:01,192
plating gold with gold creates a more vibrant finish. 

325
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,194
after one last quality check, 

326
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,662
these chains are ready to dazzle their way      

327
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,432
to a neckline near you.
