00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,358
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,728
plastic bottles and jars...  

5
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,632
...mail...           

6
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,004
...eggs...           

7
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,011
...and handcrafted wooden pens.

8
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,921
whether you're buying apple juice or peanut butter, 

9
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,590
you've probably noticed that fewer products      

10
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,193
come in glass containers these days.          

11
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,329
plastic packaging is becoming more common.    

12
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,533
plastic bottles and jars are lighter to carry      

13
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,135
and leave no shards of glass to clean up          

14
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,438
if you drop your grocery bag. 

15
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,210
many transparent bottles and jars            

16
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,279
are made from a type of plastic

17
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,547
called polyethylene terephthalate,         

18
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,383
or p.e.t.           

19
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,288
an automated mixer combines p.e.t. pellets         

20
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,757
with flakes of recycled p.e.t. 

21
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:37,563
reprocessed plastic loses   
some of its physical properties,

22
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:41,233
so the recycled content can't exceed 10%.       

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,172
the p.e.t. drops from the mixer 
into a plastic injection machine

24
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,109
that heats it to a piping 600 degrees fahrenheit.    

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,881
the dry raw material melts into
thick and gooey liquid plastic.

26
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,919
the machine then shoots it at high pressure into a mold. 

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,257
this plastic injection molding process            

28
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,126
casts pieces of plastic called preforms,        

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,929
starter shapes that subsequent machines    

30
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,465
will transform into bottles or jars.     

31
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,203
the molded preforms harden almost instantly,       

32
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,074
thanks to a built-in cooling system.        

33
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,210
these preforms are now on their way      

34
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,046
to becoming single-serving juice bottles.         

35
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,821
this is another plastic injection molding machine.   

36
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,890
it uses the same method to make preforms        

37
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,727
for a different model -- 1 1/2- to 2-liter bottles.   

38
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,305
the preform's next stop    

39
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,409
is a machine called a reheat stretch-blow molder. 

40
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,446
in a matter of seconds,    

41
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,582
it heats each preform just enough          

42
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,651
to make the plastic malleable, 

43
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:09,054
then inserts a rod to stretch the preform lengthwise     

44
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,191
while at the same time blowing in air         

45
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,459
at extremely high pressure.  

46
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:18,463
this forces the preform into a bottle-shaped mold.   

47
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,799
cold water circulates within the mold        

48
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,336
to cool and set the plastic almost instantly.       

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,273
this lightning-fast machine  

50
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:32,010
churns out 10,600 bottles per hour.           

51
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,581
no wonder we've had to show it to you in slow motion.     

52
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,957
a conveyor belt transports the finished bottles      

53
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,460
to the packaging area.     

54
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,304
before blow molding,      

55
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,974
the preforms for certain models
first pass through an oven.  

56
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,911
a technician sets the heat level

57
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,780
of each infrared oven lamp individually,         

58
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,450
applying more or less heat at various points       

59
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:15,654
to influence the thickness and shaping of the plastic.  

60
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,790
from the oven,         

61
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,126
the preforms go into another reheat stretch-blow molder   

62
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,664
that transforms them into peanut jars.       

63
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,668
it's the same process for this peanut butter jar.  

64
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,471
after molding, the machine instantly cools the plastic,  

65
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,574
locking in the shape.     

66
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,813
the factory pulls samples off the line at regular intervals 

67
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,749
for quality-control testing.  

68
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,885
technicians measure the thickness of the plastic  

69
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,656
and perform a compression test to gauge its strength.     

70
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,764
they verify the sample's dimensions and capacity.    

71
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,034
they also evaluate resistance to vacuum pressure       

72
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:06,771
because containers are often vacuum sealed after filling.  

73
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,708
some models must also be strong enough   

74
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,177
to resist the pressure of their contents --      

75
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,413
carbonated soft drinks, for instance.         

76
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,518
the recycled material used in making these bottles and jars 

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,521
doesn't come from used plastic containers. 

78
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,390
for hygienic reasons,     

79
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,126
the factory recycles only new plastic        

80
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,996
left over from its manufacturing process.

81
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,666
the finished containers,    
of course, are fully recyclable.

82
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,470
they're typically reprocessed into other plastic products  

83
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:41,506
or into products that contain some plastic.   

84
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,619
narrator: what do the letters "f," "d," "i," "o," and "u"  

85
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,154
have in common?        

86
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,557
they're all part of postal codes

87
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,626
used in abbreviations for state names.        

88
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:05,030
these letters and numbers are read by high-tech machines 

89
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,998
that sort our mail.      

90
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:16,174
the trucks unload the containers
picked up from postal outlets...

91
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,845
and bags of mail that were   
collected from public mailboxes.

92
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,714
the containers go straight to automated sorting.     

93
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,285
their contents have already been classified by size.    

94
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,889
not so for the bags.      

95
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,128
postal workers empty them and put standard-size envelopes

96
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,797
on a conveyor belt leading to one sorting machine...    

97
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,935
...and large envelopes     
into a bin destined for another.

98
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,074
the standard-sized letters travel to a high-speed,    

99
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,811
high-tech machine that checks for postage.    

100
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,682
stamps contain an invisible fluorescent material      

101
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,884
that illuminates under ultraviolet light.    

102
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:04,556
the machine's u.v. sensor scans
both sides of every envelope. 

103
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,091
no glow, no go.        

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,629
letters with postage are canceled with a postmark  

105
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,297
so the stamps can't be reused. 

106
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,834
the postal mark contains the date, the state, 

107
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,870
and the sorting plant's postal code.          

108
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,774
next stop, a machine      

109
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,578
called the multiline optical character reader...      

110
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,180
an impressive piece of equipment

111
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:33,384
that processes up to 30,000 letters per hour. 

112
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,587
it reads and digitally photographs   

113
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,455
each destination address,   

114
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,792
matching it to the computer's address database.       

115
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,194
then it prints the postal code 

116
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,864
in barcode format on the front of the envelope. 

117
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:57,008
a scanner now reads the barcodes
and does a preliminary sorting. 

118
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,278
local and regional mail stays here           

119
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,947
and moves on to the next sorting machine  

120
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,348
for a more detailed breakdown. 

121
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,685
letters addressed to other regions        

122
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,553
go to the postal plants there, 

123
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,056
where a thorough sorting will take place.        

124
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,027
but what happens when all this sophisticated technology    

125
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,496
just can't make out the address

126
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,834
due to, say, sloppy handwriting
or smudged ink?        

127
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,305
the optical character reader machine puts the letter on hold

128
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,242
and sends the address photo to the video encoding system. 

129
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,245
a postal worker deciphers the writing     

130
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,247
and types in the postal code, 

131
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,851
sending the letter back into the sorting system.    

132
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,220
now the local and regional mail

133
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,058
goes through what's called the bcs -- the barcode sorter. 

134
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,329
this performs a more detailed sorting by postal route.    

135
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,898
the machine scans the barcodes 

136
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,469
at a rate of 30,000 letters per hour, sending the mail   

137
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:01,206
to the corresponding letter carrier's bin.     

138
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,207
a worker preps the mail    

139
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,511
for each route, grouping and labeling it by sector.   

140
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,483
meanwhile, the large envelopes 

141
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,085
go through what's called the flat sorting machine.   

142
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,887
it does what three machines did

143
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,223
for the standard-sized letters --           

144
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,359
postmarks the stamp, reads the address,       

145
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,963
applies a barcode sticker, reads the barcode,       

146
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,965
sorts the mail, and drops it  

147
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,701
into the corresponding letter carrier's bin.      

148
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,371
if the machine can't make out an address,          

149
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,640
the envelope goes for manual sorting.      

150
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,777
in manual sorting,       

151
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,780
postal workers handle more than just illegible addresses. 

152
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,450
they also hand sort mail going out of country      

153
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,852
and envelopes that are too thick or bulky  

154
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,189
to go through the automated machines.    

155
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,325
at all stages         
of mail processing and delivery,

156
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,926
workers are on the lookout   

157
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,063
for envelopes bearing insufficient postage.     

158
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,067
those letters are returned to sender.    

159
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,338
letter carriers sort the mail 

160
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,407
for the routes by street and house number.       

161
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,609
if they have a walking route, 

162
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,279
they load up their first bagful
and head off.         

163
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,880
a truck delivers the rest   

164
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,384
to a locked box along the route
called a relay box.      

165
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,756
carriers pick up the rest of  
their mail when they pass by it.

166
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,559
some letter carriers have   
what's called a motorized route.

167
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,896
they deliver all their customers' mail by truck,   

168
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:35,900
which sure beats walking door-to-door in a blizzard.  

169
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,778
narrator: hens don't have to mate to lay eggs,       

170
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,847
and as long as there's no rooster in the vicinity,    

171
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,984
the eggs will remain unfertilized and edible.    

172
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,187
the color of the shell is determined by the breed of hen,

173
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,722
but there's no pecking order  

174
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,524
when it comes to shell color.        

175
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:03,094
white or brown, all eggs are the same inside. 

176
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,867
the action begins in the hen house,       

177
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,536
where female chickens start laying eggs       

178
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,538
when they're 19 weeks old.   

179
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
the building is well-ventilated,

180
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,377
and the temperature and humidity
are strictly controlled.    

181
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,346
to stimulate laying,      

182
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,150
fluorescent lighting simulates 15 hours of daylight.

183
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:30,955
the hens eat a measured amount of food three times a day.   

184
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,225
their feed is made up of various grains       

185
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,361
mixed with soybeans for protein.

186
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,097
it's fortified with vitamins and minerals          

187
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,967
and contain calcium to strengthen the eggshells.  

188
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,104
the hens drink water from nipple-ended tubes    

189
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,973
attached to their cages.    

190
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,576
all these carefully monitored conditions 

191
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,645
are designed to maximize the yield.     

192
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:57,382
the average hen lays about 300 eggs a year.  

193
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,984
the cage floor is sloped    

194
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,955
so the eggs automatically roll onto a conveyor belt.     

195
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,259
then it's onto a larger conveyor belt,    

196
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,663
which transports the eggs to the packing room.      

197
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,865
the hens' manure drops through the bottom of their cages   

198
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,668
onto a conveyor below.     

199
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,205
even so, some eggs get dirty. 

200
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,942
they'll be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected later on.   

201
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:46,231
automated equipment transfers the eggs onto plastic flats.  

202
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,366
it places them wide-end up   

203
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,269
to keep the yolks properly centered.       

204
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,907
the flats go into a cold room 

205
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,710
until a refrigerated truck ships
them to the grading station,  

206
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,447
whose job is to classify the eggs by quality.      

207
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,519
the best, grade "a," end up on supermarket shelves. 

208
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,656
lesser grades go to processing plants    

209
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:15,660
to be turned into ingredients used in foods, pharmaceuticals,

210
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,196
and products such as shampoos. 

211
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:23,000
this automated station is high-tech and high-speed,  

212
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:27,172
processing 144,000 eggs per hour.           

213
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,143
first, a suction machine lifts the eggs off the flats     

214
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,746
and transfers them onto a moving track      

215
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,082
leading to the cleaning station.

216
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,684
there, a washer gently scrubs the eggs     

217
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,887
with soap and disinfectant.  

218
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,891
the water is just over 100 degrees fahrenheit.    

219
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,961
anything hotter would cook the eggs.      

220
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,031
then, it's into a dryer for five seconds,       

221
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,699
where a fan sucks up the moisture.         

222
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,971
the eggs then pass over a bright light,        

223
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,640
which highlights the condition of the shells.  

224
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:06,244
workers do a preliminary visual inspection,       

225
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,580
removing any that are cracked. 

226
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,451
a grading camera above     

227
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,653
assesses the condition and quality          

228
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,188
of the shell's exterior.    

229
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,661
further down the line,     

230
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,198
other cameras will inspect the interior for blood.    

231
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,469
to check the strength of the eggshells,       

232
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,672
acoustic sensors tap on the eggs.        

233
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:38,843
they detect brittle shells by the different sound of the tap.

234
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,083
the inspection machines mark and reject any egg       

235
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,952
that doesn't make the grade -- grade "a," that is.      

236
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,090
the approved eggs move on to electronic scales,     

237
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:56,094
which register their weight class from peewee to jumbo.  

238
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,364
pressure-controlled claws then transport them      

239
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,766
to the corresponding packaging line.        

240
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,236
on the way, every egg gets stamped with a lot number    

241
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,705
for quality-control tracking. 

242
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,574
the packing machine stamps the egg cartons     

243
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,109
with a "best before" date.   

244
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,246
the eggs have a shelf life of 35 days.          

245
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,948
as for the hens,        

246
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,451
their expiration date comes at 72 weeks,       

247
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,254
when the eggs they lay are no longer consumption-quality. 

248
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,256
for all their hard work,    

249
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,994
they win an all-expenses-paid trip to the slaughterhouse.  

250
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,474
narrator: a pen set is a classic
gift for any occasion,     

251
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,211
be it a birthday, graduation, or promotion.         

252
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,347
we're not talking pens     

253
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,016
of the inexpensive, ball-point variety...     

254
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,018
but rather those cadillac models

255
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,888
in sleek metal or sumptuous wood.       

256
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:10,101
the quill dates back to about 700 a.d.       

257
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,103
made from a bird feather,   

258
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:15,039
it's tip had to be repeatedly dipped in ink.         

259
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,107
messy and inefficient,     

260
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,444
the quill remained the norm for more than 1,000 years.   

261
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,647
in 1884,            

262
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,115
an american invented the fountain pen,       

263
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,653
with its built-in refillable ink barrel.     

264
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,657
but the true revolution came with the no-fuss ball-point pen

265
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,861
patented by two hungarian brothers in 1938.       

266
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,008
handcrafted wooden pens can be made from just one type of wood

267
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,477
or from a combination of woods.

268
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,614
this artisan uses some 50 different kinds, 

269
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,617
ranging from domestic maple and oak            

270
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,888
to imported rosewood, ebony, olive wood, and purpleheart.  

271
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,361
when using just one type of wood,            

272
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,563
he runs the block through a band saw,      

273
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,566
cutting a strip 6/10 of an inch wide.     

274
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,037
then, with a radial saw,    

275
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,438
he cuts that strip into two pieces,        

276
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,507
each about two inches long.  

277
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,412
these will become the pen's top
and bottom casings.      

278
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,382
using a tool called a drill press,     

279
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,051
he bores a hole roughly 3/10 of an inch in diameter  

280
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,154
right through each piece.   

281
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,525
making a pen from a combination of woods  

282
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,593
takes a little more work.   

283
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,663
instead of using a block of solid wood,         

284
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,998
he constructs a block     

285
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,967
by gluing together thin planks of contrasting woods.     

286
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,541
once the glue dries, he uses a wood planer     

287
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,577
to remove the excess and smooth out the sides.   

288
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,482
then, just as he did for the single-wood pen,    

289
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:08,219
he cuts the block into strips 6/10 of an inch wide.     

290
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,490
this time, he slices diagonally

291
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,793
so that each strip showcases the multiple woods.      

292
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,631
again, he cuts pieces for the top and bottom casings,

293
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,501
then drills a hole through them.

294
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:27,705
from this point on, whether he's using one or more woods, 

295
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,941
the process is the same.    

296
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,111
he coats two brass tubes with glue           

297
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,046
and inserts one in each casing.

298
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,182
a few drops of water are added to expand the adhesive     

299
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:42,453
into any gaps between the tube and surrounding wood.     

300
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,190
these brass tubes will house the pen's mechanism.

301
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,995
the glue takes about an hour to dry.  

302
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,868
then he uses what's called a hand mill          

303
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,671
to square all the angles and remove the excess glue.  

304
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,279
now for the artistic part.   

305
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,884
he turns the casings on a lathe to shape them.   

306
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,285
first, he rounds them out.   

307
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,222
then, using a series of tools, 

308
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,825
he gives each casing unique detailing.       

309
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,767
he highlights the grooves by using the heat       

310
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,937
that friction generates to burn them dark.       

311
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,648
when the design work's done,  

312
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,685
he runs sanding cord inside the grooves.       

313
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,727
then he sands the surface three times          

314
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,330
with progressively finer sandpaper.           

315
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,468
to protect the wood,      

316
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,803
he varnishes the casings    

317
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,339
with four coats of hardwood-floor varnish,   

318
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,075
sanding between each application.       

319
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,680
when the last coat dries, he can assemble the pen,    

320
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,715
starting with the tip.     

321
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,285
he glues it to the bottom casing,     

322
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,022
tapping it with a mallet to ensure it's fully inserted. 

323
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,964
the tip is made of titanium, a very resilient metal.    

324
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,901
next comes the clip, also made of titanium.     

325
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,570
he glues it into the top casing.

326
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,773
finally, using a vise,     

327
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,709
he forces in the pen's mechanism.      

328
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,247
the mechanism houses a replaceable ink cartridge.  

329
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,850
a titanium ring joins the two casings.     

330
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,454
as an added touch,       

331
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,025
the pen can be personalized with an engraved clip.     

332
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:07,931
and the gift box can bear the recipient's name      

333
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,067
or a corporate logo.
