00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,491
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,193
        glass bottles...        

5
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,133
         ...hacksaws...         

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,973
      ...and goalie masks.      

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,187
     whether they're colored    
            or clear,           

8
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,522
     glass bottles and jars     
           are green.           

9
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,592
      no trees died to make     
  this eco-friendly packaging.  

10
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,996
    glass is made of natural    
 ingredients that are abundant. 

11
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,264
you can recycle glass endlessly,

12
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,502
 and making it uses less energy 
than producing metal or plastic.

13
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,744
      the recipe for glass      

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,747
  combines about a half a dozen 
     natural, raw materials,    

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,484
        but the main ones       
   are silica sand, soda ash,   

16
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,086
         and limestone.         

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,223
  silica sand usually makes up  
     about 45% of the batch.    

18
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,494
     the soda ash helps melt    
       the silica evenly.       

19
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,029
     it comprises about 15%.    

20
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,299
a limestone content of about 10%

21
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,502
     make the finished glass    
          more durable.         

22
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,305
 they combine these ingredients 
       with recycled glass      

23
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,773
         called cullet.         

24
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,981
  the factory's equipment feeds 
precise amounts of the materials

25
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,583
         into a furnace.        

26
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,718
        over a full day,        
        the fiery heat --       

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,521
   2,730 degrees fahrenheit --  

28
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,123
   melts everything together,   

29
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,059
    producing a gooey liquid    
that's the consistency of honey.

30
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,928
        the molten glass        
    pours out of the furnace.   

31
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,331
      sheers cut the flow       
      at precise intervals      

32
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,333
  to produce cylindrical gobs.  

33
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,535
            each gob            
  is the exact amount required  

34
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,470
   to make one bottle or jar.   

35
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,872
      they drop to a device     
        called the scoop.       

36
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,141
 the scoop moves them to troughs

37
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,678
  that feed them to jar-forming 
  and bottle-forming machines.  

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,824
      a gob of molten glass     
  goes into a preliminary mold. 

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,093
     in a matter of seconds,    

40
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,161
  it comes out as what's called 
           a parison,           

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,264
      a miniature version       
      of the final bottle.      

42
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,968
     each parison then moves    
        into a blow mold,       

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,238
the cavity of which is the shape
      of the final bottle.      

44
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,777
     the equipment blows the    
compressed air into the parison,

45
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,212
  stretching the glass outward  

46
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,548
         toward the wall        
       of the mold cavity.      

47
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,118
      this process creates      
     the final bottle shape     

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,387
   and hollows out the inside.  

49
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,123
     these are amber-colored    
          beer bottles.         

50
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,060
      the color is produced     
by adding small amounts of iron,

51
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,963
       sulfur, and carbon       
       to the glass mix.        

52
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,207
   the factory uses a similar   
      manufacturing process     

53
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,208
     to produce other types     
      of bottles and jars.      

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,876
    in this run, the company    

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,013
    is making 375-millimeter    
          wine bottles          

56
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,949
       out of clear glass.      

57
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,887
      this run is producing     
 375-millimeter liquor bottles, 

58
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,290
    also out of clear glass.    

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,361
          but this mold         
    has a special feature --    

60
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,963
      a recessed insignia       
      on one of the walls,      

61
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,367
which produces a raised insignia
   on the front of the bottle.  

62
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,776
     after the bottles leave    
      the forming machine,      

63
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,444
   they travel through flames,  

64
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,513
      otherwise they would      
      cool down too quickly     

65
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,549
  and crack from thermal shock. 

66
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,459
   a loader now gently pushes   
           the bottles          

67
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,795
       into what's called       
       an annealing lyre.       

68
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,664
        the bottles cool        
      at a controlled rate      

69
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,332
 as they move through the lyre. 

70
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,535
      this releases stress      
    from the glass gradually.   

71
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,942
       as the bottles exit      
       the annealing lyre,      

72
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,679
 a sprayer coats their exteriors
         with lubricant.        

73
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,948
        this enables them       
        to move smoothly        

74
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,851
     through the rest of the    
 inspection and packaging line. 

75
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,823
     the bottles now line up    
         in single file         

76
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,360
   to head into the automatic   
       inspection station.      

77
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,162
      as the machine spins      
          each bottle,          

78
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,564
       cameras and probes       
     check for imperfections    

79
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,301
   such as cracks or bubbles.   

80
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,314
    the inspection equipment    
      then examines the top     

81
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,050
 to check dimensions and insure 
 the threads for the screw cap  

82
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,819
      are molded correctly.     

83
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,258
        before shipping,        

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,162
      a worker does a final     
       visual inspection.       

85
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,867
    the proportion of cullet    
and glass can be as high as 90%.

86
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,936
          cullet melts          
     at a lower temperature.    

87
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,539
   so for every 10% of cullet   
           in the mix,          

88
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,208
        the factory uses        
    up to 2 1/2% less energy    

89
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,676
      to produce its glass.     

90
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,546
     now that's an incentive    
           to recycle.          

91
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,824
            narrator:           
        the world of saws       

92
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,160
           is made up           
   of many marvelous tools --   

93
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,429
      big saws and jigsaws,     

94
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,164
     handsaws and band saws,    

95
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,166
     backsaws and hacksaws.     

96
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,368
          they all have         
     their specific purpose.    

97
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,504
      hacksaws are chiefly      
        for cutting metal       

98
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,306
    or other tough materials.   

99
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,275
     so what keeps hacksaws     
      on the cutting edge?      

100
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,950
  hacksaws come in many shapes  
           and sizes.           

101
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,919
  companies make hacksaw blades 

102
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,656
       out of a wide range      
        of steel alloys.        

103
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,525
    here a thin band of steel   
      feeds into a machine      

104
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,195
    that cuts it into blanks    
      10 to 12 inches long      

105
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,231
      and a half-inch high.     

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,738
     workers load 300 blanks    
      at a time into a jig.     

107
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,072
    they lightly hammer them    

108
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,343
  to compress them into a block 
       for easier cutting.      

109
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,212
    they then feed the block    

110
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,347
         into a machine         
     called a mill grinder.     

111
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,084
       it cuts teeth into       
  the upper side of the blanks. 

112
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,556
     a water-based lubricant    
washes away the metal particles.

113
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,237
       this hacksaw model       
      has a 24-point blade,     

114
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,108
 which means there are 24 teeth 
         to every inch.         

115
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,511
           workers use          
     an ordinary paintbrush     

116
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,880
  to remove any metal residue.  

117
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,322
 the quality-control department 
 inspects each blade for flaws. 

118
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,791
then it's off to the next phase.

119
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,797
   next, a separator detaches   
     each of the 300 blades,    

120
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,568
  aligns them, then sends them  
   through a setting machine.   

121
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,340
   the machine bends the teeth  
         to either side         

122
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,609
       at a slight angle.       

123
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,077
   this is called offsetting.   

124
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,211
     it'll enable the blade     

125
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,347
     to clear away particles    
           as it saws,          

126
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,416
   preventing it from jamming.  

127
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,690
          now it's time         
      to harden the teeth.      

128
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,960
      the factory does this     
   by heat-treating the metal.  

129
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,564
  a worm gear aligns the blades 
    to enter a heating coil.    

130
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,438
        in this process,        

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,108
the electromagnetic heating coil
         heats the teeth        

132
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,111
     to temperatures as high    
   as 2,200 degrees fahrenheit  

133
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,979
 depending on the type of metal.

134
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,983
       this takes no more       
       than two seconds.        

135
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,119
      after the blades exit     
        the heating coil,       

136
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,055
       the surrounding air      
         cools them down        

137
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,790
  over the next several hours.  

138
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,860
      this phase is called      
         air quenching.         

139
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,996
    the blades are now ready    
          for printing.         

140
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,131
    an offset printing press    
           applies ink          

141
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,467
       to raised lettering      
         on a cylinder.         

142
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,934
 that cylinder transfers the ink

143
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,337
            to strips           
  mounted on another cylinder.  

144
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,272
     these strips then print    
        the company name,       

145
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,808
the blade length, and the number
        of teeth per inch       

146
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,243
   on the side of the blades.   

147
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,283
now a machine inserts the blades
        in groups of five       

148
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,019
   into slots called fingers.   

149
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,753
  the fingers rotate the blades 

150
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,023
         and place them         
       on a conveyor belt.      

151
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,966
  the machine raises the blades 

152
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,436
     and tapes them together    
           at one end.          

153
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,438
      this makes it easier      
        to transport them       

154
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,841
 to another part of the factory 
   where production continues.  

155
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,112
   next, the hacksaw's frame,   

156
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,782
    the component that holds    
           the blade.           

157
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,518
          workers place         
  the frame components in a jig 

158
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,988
        that's positioned       
     on a rotating carousel.    

159
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,992
        a robotic welder        
      fuses the components.     

160
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,000
   a press punches three holes  
          in the handle         

161
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,337
      for attaching a foam      
        or plastic grip.        

162
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,542
   workers fit the two halves   
  of the grip in a sonic welder 

163
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:13,745
      that fuses them using     
   high-frequency sound waves.  

164
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,281
 the sound waves create friction
          at the seam.          

165
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,618
   this generates enough heat   
   to melt the parts together.  

166
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,955
     now the frame is ready     
         for the blade.         

167
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,091
       an automatic device      
       tightens a wing nut      

168
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,026
  to put tension on the blade.  

169
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,430
 a final quality-control check. 

170
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,299
   with each randomly selected  
             blade,             

171
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,301
the testing machine cuts through
   a block of stainless steel.  

172
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,038
 the machine performs this test 
      six times per blade.      

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,776
  then the computer calculates  
 the average number of strokes. 

174
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:48,012
if the average falls within the 
norms for this particular model,

175
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,448
  the batch gets the thumbs-up. 

176
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,864
 narrator: goalie masks are all 
 about putting up a tough front.

177
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,400
       it's not just their      
   protective shell and cage.   

178
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,137
      their wild paint jobs     
   are designed to intimidate.  

179
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,538
 incredibly, back in the 1960s, 

180
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,275
    the first masked goalies    
     were ridiculed by fans     

181
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,877
      who viewed the masks      
     as a sign of weakness.     

182
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,847
          it was a case         
   of adding insult to injury.  

183
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,030
     today these masks allow    
 the goaltender to play it safe,

184
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,100
   so they're far less likely   
         to be sidelined        

185
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,102
      by a serious injury.      

186
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,273
 they start with a plaster mold 
       of an average joe.       

187
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,382
    they plug the mouth hole    
        with plasticine.        

188
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,453
   this insures that the mold   
     won't spring any leaks     

189
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,056
       while they fill it       
     with plaster of paris.     

190
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,538
         they let it dry        
        for half an hour.       

191
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,273
       then they pull off       
        the initial mold        

192
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,442
 to reveal the solid impression.

193
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,215
      they press plasticine     
      onto strategic areas.     

194
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,551
           this mimics          
     the foam safety guards     

195
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,520
    that cushion every mask.    

196
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,158
        the final result        
        is called a plug,       

197
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,528
  and it will be used to make   
  a two-part compression mold.  

198
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,234
 after applying a black sealer, 
     they polish it smooth,     

199
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,502
    eliminating imperfections   

200
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,238
      that would be visible     
           on the mold          

201
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,073
 they're going to make from it. 

202
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,779
    over at another station,    

203
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,550
   a worker in protective garb  
   unrolls fiberglass fabric.   

204
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,585
he cuts and layers sheets of it,

205
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:10,188
       then draws patterns      
       onto the tops one,       

206
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,257
       spacing the shapes       
        closely together        

207
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,391
       to minimize waste.       

208
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,865
      the goal is to score      
        100 goalie masks        

209
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,967
   from one roll of material.   

210
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,870
      using a disc cutter,      

211
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:29,774
   he slices through 25 layers  
    of the fiberglass fabric.   

212
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,684
     then he stacks various     
      composite fabrics --      

213
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,688
  several of the fiberglass one 
    and patches of kevlar --    

214
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,955
       for reinforcement.       

215
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,224
        kevlar can absorb       
         so much impact,        

216
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,094
         it's also used         
   to make bulletproof vests.   

217
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,998
      he places more fabric     
        over the kevlar.        

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,135
    he spreads an epoxy resin   
        onto each layer.        

219
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,574
   he drapes them over a mold   
 that's been made from the plug 

220
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,977
    and smoothes the material   
    to eliminate air pockets    

221
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,646
    as he continues to layer    
            and glue.           

222
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,326
 he's laminating all the pieces 
      together to form one.     

223
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,928
          he trims away         
       the ragged edges...      

224
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,133
       ...and then places       
 the inside portion of the mold 

225
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,135
      into the outside one.     

226
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:35,206
the wet fabric is now sandwiched
    between two mold pieces.    

227
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,748
    he lowers a one-ton press   
to compress the layers of fabric

228
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,353
   as the resins between them   
    continue to form a bond.    

229
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,924
       he adds some clamps      
      to keep things tight.     

230
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,099
   after 20 minutes, he pries   
 the laminated fiberglass shell 

231
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,600
        out of the mold.        

232
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,807
  this is one very tough shell. 

233
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,444
        it's the raw form       
        of a goalie mask,       

234
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,446
       but it still needs       
         a lot of work.         

235
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,616
       so it's over to the      
 trimming-and-grinding station. 

236
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,520
      he places a trim jig      
         over the shell.        

237
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,190
   using a high-speed router,   
he cuts an opening for the cage.

238
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,937
     he slices off the flash    
      with a disc grinder.      

239
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,275
        and then he sands       
      and grinds the edges.     

240
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,149
         he drills holes        
  to attach various fasteners.  

241
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,451
 then he carves out larger holes
         for ventilation        

242
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,953
and to reduce the mask's weight.

243
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,354
        coming up next...       

244
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,825
     watch as the paint pros    
   go to work on these shells.  

245
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,702
            narrator:           
   the makers of goalie masks   

246
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,238
       have turned safety       
       into an art form.        

247
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,374
         the goalie mask        
       has become a canvas      

248
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,043
   for some very bold designs   
           and colors.          

249
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,512
           it's a kind          
     of psychological tactic    

250
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,047
  to intimidate the other team, 

251
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,316
    and it also scores points   
          with the fans         

252
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,218
  who like the cool paint job.  

253
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,593
       they prep the mask       
       by roughing it up        

254
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,528
     with an orbital sander.    

255
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,133
     then they pour a sealer    
        into a container.       

256
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,402
         the technician         
   wears a charcoal respirator  

257
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,805
because the emissions are toxic.

258
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,874
             he adds            
    the activator solution...   

259
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:55,113
     and a reactive reducer     
 and stirs the sealer together. 

260
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,818
  then he sprays the sealer mix 
         onto the masks.        

261
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,353
 the finish will cure and harden

262
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,489
     as the chemicals in it     
    generate their own heat.    

263
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,494
   next, this system stirs up   
 some hot hues automotive paint 

264
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,932
as the technician sprays a vivid
 gold base coat onto the masks. 

265
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,308
        computer graphics       
  created with signlab software 

266
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,843
      are sent to a plotter     

267
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,346
     that cuts out adhesive     
       vinyl paint masks.       

268
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,855
  he pulls away unneeded vinyl  
       around the stencil,      

269
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,057
    a process called weeding.   

270
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,328
    then he presses the vinyl   
stencils against the goalie mask

271
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,764
and peels off the paper backing.

272
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,602
       applying a stencil       
     to the crown is tricky     

273
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,005
       because the surface      
     is curved with ridges,     

274
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,340
     so it doesn't lay flat.    

275
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,143
  he lifts and cuts the pattern 
      with a utility knife      

276
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,345
  and then straightens it out.  

277
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,618
  this mask is starting to look 
       pretty impressive,       

278
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,288
 but they cover the whole thing 
        with white paint.       

279
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,624
   it's a temporary cover-up.   

280
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,627
    this process is all about   
  layering patterns and color.  

281
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,367
  they apply more vinyl shapes. 

282
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,836
         and then, using        
   a pressurized paint system,  

283
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,706
      they spray everything     
           bright red.          

284
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,910
   next, an artist airbrushes   
         some shadowing         

285
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:36,114
   onto the now barely visible  
        image of a leaf.        

286
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,722
       he peels away some       
    of the paint-mask vinyl.    

287
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,963
          and it's time         
    for a really neat effect.   

288
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,968
    he sprinkles the surface    
    of the mask with water.     

289
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,074
  then he mists it with paint,  

290
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,643
     and the water droplets     
        catch the paint.        

291
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,749
  he blasts it with a heat gun. 

292
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,283
      the water evaporates,     

293
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,219
       but the paint dries      
        in droplet form,        

294
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,989
 giving the mask a frosty look. 

295
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,163
   he airbrushes a drop shadow  
     around some lettering,     

296
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,102
dispensing with the usual safety
  gloves for this detail work.  

297
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,839
     and now all is revealed    
   as he peels away the vinyl.  

298
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,644
         the goalie mask        
   is showing its true colors.  

299
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,650
           but wait --          
a little touch-up job is needed.

300
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,789
     he traces the pattern      
     onto see-through paper     

301
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,792
      and then transfers it     
       onto bristol board.      

302
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,195
         he cuts it out         
      with a utility knife.     

303
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,932
        then he aligns it       
    with a shape on the mask    

304
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,067
    and precisely airbrushes    
            around it           

305
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,603
  to make the smudge disappear. 

306
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:14,145
    with a final clear coat,    
  this mask has visual impact.  

307
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,747
 it makes a colorful statement. 

308
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:21,151
        and now it's time       
 to put all the pieces together.

309
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,353
          she screws on         
    the stainless-steel cage    

310
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,022
    and applies a little glue   

311
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,059
 to reinforce the adhesive-back 
        foam cushioning.        

312
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,299
   she attaches the sweatband   
           with velcro          

313
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,202
so it can be removed and washed.

314
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,177
      and then she moves on     
       to the back plate.       

315
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,512
     she threads the harness    
     through the back plate     

316
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,881
    to the front of the mask    
         to attach them.        

317
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,316
     the harness is elastic,    

318
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,387
      so it gives the mask      
        some flexibility.       

319
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,457
         now it's ready         
       for some ice time.       

320
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,925
     and with their various     
       custom paint jobs,       

321
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,696
       these masks all say      
     the "puck" stops here.     

322
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,805
