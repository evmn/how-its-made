00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,291
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,160
fishing reels...        

3
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,932
...miniature houses...     

4
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:41,540
...and kitchen mixers.     

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,721
the chinese in the 12th century

6
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,323
were first to wind excess fishing line on their rods   

7
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,859
before unreeling it back into the water.      

8
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,461
today's reels have gears    

9
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,729
to quickly deploy and retrieve the line.     

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,532
they're made with lightweight, high-strength materials    

11
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,801
so you can catch bigger, stronger fish --        

12
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,670
or at least try to.      

13
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,613
antique reels are heavy and have just one speed.    

14
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,083
modern reels have two speeds and fewer parts.  

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,485
to make a reel's frame,    

16
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,221
a computer-guided router cuts four openings       

17
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,223
in a cylinder made of aluminum.

18
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,424
they let the angler -- the person fishing --      

19
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,360
access the spool inside the frame        

20
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,329
to undo any knots in the line. 

21
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,435
another cutting machine shapes a stainless-steel blank    

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,637
into a spindle, the inner part of the reel   

23
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,438
around which the fishing line winds.    

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,609
it also carves         
two pinion gears into the piece.

25
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,644
the high gear retrieves line faster.     

26
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,781
the low gear gives more power to fight big fish.       

27
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,588
the machine's cutters are made of carbide,      

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,123
an extremely durable material. 

29
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,093
even so, workers change them weekly.  

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,534
another cutter carves the reel's main gears --    

31
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,602
a high-speed and a low-speed. 

32
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,339
these main gears interact with the pinion gears 

33
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,007
to make the spool revolve.   

34
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,110
this lets the angler wind line back onto the reel. 

35
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,550
this cutter drills small indentations,   

36
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,152
part of the reel's drag system,

37
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,288
which lets the angler adjust line tension      

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,558
to fight large fish.      

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,894
the next cutter engraves the company name   

40
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:46,564
into one of the reel's two side plates.        

41
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,568
yet another cutter engraves the drag settings --      

42
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,070
"1" through "4" and then "strike."       

43
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,839
strike lets the angler     

44
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,708
fight fish weighing up to 2,000 pounds.  

45
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,046
next, a process called anodizing.  

46
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,916
the side plates are dipped in a series of chemical baths 

47
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,586
that bind a gold-colored dye to their surface.       

48
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,060
now time to assemble the fishing reel. 

49
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,996
first, they apply waterproof grease and lubricant

50
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,265
to two safety catches that prevent an angler     

51
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,734
from applying too little or too much line tension.   

52
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,942
a worker then adds a bearing  

53
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,811
to support the spindle in the spool.         

54
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,080
he also installs what's called a click plate  

55
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,849
that makes clicking sounds when a fish takes the line.  

56
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,590
he adds a stainless-steel   
spindle sleeve and drag plate...

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,729
...and a sturdy synthetic washer.       

58
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:56,635
he then adds the spindle and pinion gears to the spool. 

59
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:00,105
the spool is now ready to go into the frame.      

60
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,780
using a rotating clamp to steady the reel,      

61
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,849
another worker installs    

62
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,319
a stainless-steel fixture that attaches the reel to the rod...

63
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,892
and installs the left-side plate
with six screws.        

64
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,735
this metal spring and plunger 

65
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,537
enable the angler to change speeds from high to low 

66
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,674
with just the push of a button.

67
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:41,813
a metal clip locks the mechanism in place. 

68
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,415
a little grease to the gearing,
then a plastic cover,     

69
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,951
and the spool is fully assembled.      

70
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,755
he inserts it in the frame and installs a harness lug,  

71
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,889
used to attach the reel    

72
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,624
to what's called a fighting harness,      

73
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,758
worn to prevent a fish     

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,560
from yanking the rod out of your hands.       

75
00:04:57,498 --> 00:05:00,032
now the worker mounts the right-side plate.  

76
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,368
he adds a lever and a knob to adjust the drag settings.  

77
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,038
you turn the knob clockwise for more tension,       

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,174
counterclockwise for less.   

79
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,982
next, he installs the     
stainless-steel-and-plastic knob

80
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,084
you use to reel in the line.  

81
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,090
and finally,          
the button for switching speeds.

82
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,194
he tests the drag lever and gears           

83
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,730
to check if they engage properly.    

84
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,698
he puts it into high speed to see     

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,668
if the safety catch prevents what's called free spooling,  

86
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,004
a glitch that could send a 1/2 mile of line       

87
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,808
flying wildly out of control and leave you "reeling."    

88
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,092
narrator: for hundreds of years,     

89
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,227
dollhouses have been hot property.    

90
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,694
at first,           

91
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,497
they were built to entertain the children of the wealthy,  

92
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,899
but eventually,        

93
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,969
mass production made these mini mansions widely available.

94
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,104
and today, they continue to be 

95
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,208
great places for childhood fantasies to reside.      

96
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,252
any home-building project is all about the details,   

97
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,922
but the details don't get much smaller than this.    

98
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:34,392
these dollhouses are miniature versions of actual homes,   

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,128
made to scale.         

100
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,863
they take a big sheet of plywood

101
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,666
and slice it into smaller pieces.      

102
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,869
for a consistently accurate job,
they use a saw guide,     

103
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,874
which positions the wood for a specific cut.      

104
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,309
there's a different guide for each dollhouse part.    

105
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,280
using a hot iron,       

106
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:00,318
they brand the company name onto a foundation part.    

107
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,026
this dollhouse will be sold as a kit,     

108
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,829
and here, they demonstrate how to put it together.    

109
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,707
back on the production line, they're milling the siding.   

110
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,709
this machine cuts furrows in wood panels         

111
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,244
to mimic a clapboard finish.  

112
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,457
next, using a router, they cut window and door holes.

113
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,269
and now the walls go up.    

114
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,139
because this is a kit, each piece has to be a perfect fit, 

115
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,342
because, unlike a real construction project,  

116
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,112
they can't do recuts on-site. 

117
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,022
they install the second floor 

118
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,024
and tape it with ordinary masking tape   

119
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,226
while the glue dries.     

120
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,699
and now for the second story. 

121
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,100
it can take up to 100 hours  

122
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,236
to paint and assemble all the parts in a dollhouse kit, 

123
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,440
depending on how elaborate the design is.  

124
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,115
next, they raise the roof.   

125
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,650
this victorian design     

126
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,386
has a two-part roof with a tower in the middle.  

127
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,260
they add weight to apply pressure while the glue dries. 

128
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,663
this machine's protective cover
has been temporarily removed  

129
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,332
to show its inner workings.  

130
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,435
they carefully feed in a piece of pine.        

131
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,408
it cuts the board into little shingles,     

132
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,379
which fall into a bin below.  

133
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,086
once the shingles are stained, they hot-glue them to the roof,

134
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,223
following a grid        
that was penciled on in advance.

135
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,967
they wrap the roof with tape  

136
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,236
to stabilize it while the glue dries.     

137
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,973
back in the factory,      

138
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,242
four cutting wheels shape a piece of pine     

139
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,112
into moldings that will be used
for trim on various models.  

140
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,120
the door now goes on.     

141
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,455
it's been trimmed       

142
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,124
with some of the molding we just saw being made.     

143
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,365
the windows also have some molding details.     

144
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,401
all this trim has been made on the same machine,      

145
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,071
using different cutters for the different profiles.  

146
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,476
this railing is a nice touch  

147
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,279
and will also provide support for the structure.       

148
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,921
all that's left is the interior decorating.  

149
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,094
some people spend       
a small fortune on this stuff --

150
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,362
tiny toilets...        

151
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,595
chairs...           

152
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,032
even full kitchens in miniature.

153
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,635
and in this model of president lincoln's home,  

154
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,237
the details are historically accurate.   

155
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,309
now they carefully pack up all the pieces.        

156
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,314
soon, they'll make       

157
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,116
some child's dream of home ownership come true,  

158
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,720
but first, somebody had better read the instructions.     

159
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,063
narrator: whipping up a dessert     

160
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,265
used to take a fair bit of muscle power,  

161
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,200
until they invented a mixer with a motor      

162
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,803
in the early part of the 20th century.      

163
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,271
the first ones were very industrial-looking    

164
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,741
and not much like today's sleek models.     

165
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,076
but with this invention,    

166
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,546
the job of pastry-making has become a piece of cake.  

167
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,887
today's mixers         

168
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,724
can whisk you into a world of the culinary arts. 

169
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,227
to make one,          

170
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,363
a machine straightens wire between a row of wheels.    

171
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,299
computer-programmed forming tools         

172
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,503
make a total of a dozen bends to produce arc shapes,     

173
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:49,874
which will be used to build  
a whip attachment for the mixer.

174
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,457
to assemble a whip,      

175
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,994
a technician fits the wire arcs
into an aluminum hub,     

176
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,729
starting with the largest one 

177
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,300
and graduating down to the smallest.     

178
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,070
underneath, a punch mechanism dimples the hub        

179
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,239
to fasten each wire to it.   

180
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,548
here, they drop some dough hooks and beaters  

181
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,717
into a vibrating bowl full of metal nuggets.     

182
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,820
the friction polishes these zinc mixer attachments  

183
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,757
and gets rid of the sharp edges.

184
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,174
next, they thread a band of aluminum 

185
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,178
into a machine that bends it to the contour of the mixer.

186
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,214
it's a piece of trim that carries the brand name.  

187
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,124
a bowl feeder now funnels hollow iron weights      

188
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,929
toward a system that threads wire through each of them.   

189
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,002
mechanical arms pinch and bend the wire,    

190
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,204
making little hooks on the ends.

191
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,873
two of these weights will be used in each speed governor,  

192
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,342
a device that keeps the mixer's speed constant,  

193
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,211
despite changes in the load.  

194
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,548
to assemble the speed governor,

195
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,150
they arrange a brass hub, spring, and a washer      

196
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,820
in a holding device...     

197
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,223
and then press-fit them together.    

198
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,162
they attach the two weights to the spring assembly,    

199
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,364
using the protruding wires.  

200
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:56,501
the speed-governor system is now complete.        

201
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,105
here's how the governor weights fly out  

202
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,074
to regulate the mixer's speed. 

203
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,181
and now it's time to prepare the motor shaft.  

204
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,252
they lower this spinning steel cylinder to a revolving cutter.

205
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,453
lubricant keeps the cutter cool

206
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,190
as it carves spirals into the end of the shaft.   

207
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,063
the spiraling grooves will allow the shaft      

208
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,733
to drive the mixer's internal gears.  

209
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,871
they install the shaft,    

210
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,007
with motor windings and bearings attached,     

211
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,842
into the mixer body.      

212
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,280
next, they rivet electrical contacts 

213
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,683
to plastic control boards.   

214
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:49,354
these contacts will convey electricity to drive the motor.

215
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,435
they deliver an electrical charge to the contacts     

216
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,571
to make sure they're working. 

217
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,774
then they           
attach screws, nuts, and springs

218
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,910
to complete the control-board assembly.  

219
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,579
the control board will work  

220
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,513
in concert with the governor weights   

221
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,118
to control the mixer's speed. 

222
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,326
for these mixers to really shine,        

223
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,528
they'll need a good paint job. 

224
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,797
to prepare the mixer parts for painting,         

225
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,566
they polish them on an abrasive belt.      

226
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,338
then it's into the paint booth.

227
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,540
this is a highly charged process.   

228
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,676
the paint has a positive electrical charge  

229
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,879
and is attracted to the zinc mixer parts,    

230
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,814
which are negatively charged. 

231
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,352
now all the parts are in the mix.        

232
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,553
coming up next...       

233
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,324
we'll show you how they all come together.  

234
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,702
narrator: behind many a successful cook 

235
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,438
is a well-oiled machine that's made for speed,     

236
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,975
and that's the electric mixer. 

237
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,445
it produces the best results when the blades turn rapidly. 

238
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:24,048
if they turn too slowly, they 
won't mix the batter thoroughly,

239
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,118
and that means your pastry could be a flop.  

240
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,658
to assemble this tilt-head mixer,     

241
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,060
they install          
a gear to drive the attachments.

242
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,995
next comes the stator,     

243
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,665
which creates the electrical field for the motor.      

244
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,066
a dab of oil,         

245
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,735
and then they mount the shaft and motor windings  

246
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,237
inside the unit.        

247
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,811
they slide two motor brushes into predrilled holes.     

248
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,013
the motor brush will supply electricity    

249
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,416
to the internal components.  

250
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,490
this bearing bracket holds the motor in place.   

251
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,227
they lubricate the front of it 

252
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,897
before installing the electrical control board. 

253
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,805
they wrap a trim band with the brand name on it   

254
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,074
around the outside.      

255
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,981
next, they pour gobs of grease 

256
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,517
into the section of the mixer that will hold the gears.   

257
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,656
the gear section will be sealed
so the grease can't leak out. 

258
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,860
they attach the other half of the unit   

259
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,130
that has some gears already fixed to it.      

260
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,798
they insert a drive pin    

261
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,868
in the shaft that moves the whisk and other attachments

262
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,505
and screw the two halves together.    

263
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,075
they apply more grease to this section        

264
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,743
and then install the planetary gear.      

265
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,881
this gear will rotate the mixer
attachments around the bowl.  

266
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,883
with a mallet,         

267
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,487
the worker hammers a pin to attach the planetary gear. 

268
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:13,124
he taps a decorative ring onto the outside.       

269
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:22,300
he mounts the motor unit to the base...         

270
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,671
and marks an identification number onto the bottom.    

271
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,044
now they take the tilt-head mixer for a spin.

272
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,323
and the next step is to adjust the speed.    

273
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,792
the technician installs a speed-setting tool 

274
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,727
in the hub of the mixer.    

275
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:54,064
while the gears turn, he checks
the readout and tunes it up.  

276
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,199
each mixer has to be able   

277
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,670
to make a dizzying 200 rotations per minute.   

278
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,078
they cap the hub.       

279
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,848
the final step is testing the beater.     

280
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:17,287
they check that it's correctly positioned above the bowl.   

281
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,690
one last polish, and it's ready.

282
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,894
over at another station,    

283
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,364
they're making         
a more commercial type of mixer,

284
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,365
one with a bowl that lifts to the beater    

285
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,968
instead of a tilt-head that lowers to the bowl.    

286
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,175
they screw a base to a bowl-support piece.    

287
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:48,386
then they attach the lower housing for the beater motor. 

288
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,793
as the mixer moves on a conveyor,         

289
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,930
they install the motor and gears.      

290
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,998
they add a generous squirt of grease  

291
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,733
to lubricate the transmission 

292
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,770
and then encase the top of the motor with more housing.

293
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,640
continuing down the line,   

294
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,409
they install the electrical speed controls, 

295
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:16,113
topping it off with more housing.       

296
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,551
they wrap the signature piece of trim around it.    

297
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:35,233
using a probe, they check the wattage and speed.     

298
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,738
it passes inspection, and it's ready for packing.  

299
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,044
it's taken approximately 10 minutes    

300
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,447
to assemble this bowl-lift mixer,     

301
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,916
but it's been made to last a lifetime.      

302
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,852
and with such a range     
of attachments for these mixers,

303
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,321
you can really go "stir" crazy.
