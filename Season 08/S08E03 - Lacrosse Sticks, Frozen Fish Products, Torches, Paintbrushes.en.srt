00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,358
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,093
       lacrosse sticks...       

5
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,800
   ...frozen fish products...   

6
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,671
        ...flashlights...       

7
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,744
      ...and paintbrushes.      

8
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,921
   lacrosse is north america's  
          oldest sport.         

9
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,523
    it was back in the 1400s    

10
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,192
       that native people       
      got the ball rolling,     

11
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,261
   playing with a distinctive   
          netted stick.         

12
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,063
       french missionaries      
   decided the stick resembled  

13
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,333
the stafflike crosier, or cross,
       carried by bishops.      

14
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,170
and so the game became lacrosse.

15
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,814
     lacrosse has never been    
 more popular than it is today. 

16
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,150
    to make a lacrosse stick,   

17
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,886
    they split a hickory log    
        down the middle.        

18
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,555
  this tree was cut in the fall 
      when the sap is out,      

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,892
  so it's easier to work with.  

20
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,897
    they continue subdividing   
   the log into eight pieces.   

21
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,366
  each piece then goes through  
           a band saw,          

22
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,103
    which trims it to a width   
        of 2 1/2 inches.        

23
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:51,443
  hickory is the wood of choice 

24
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,712
       because it's tough       
        and can withstand       

25
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,848
      the high-impact game      
          of lacrosse.          

26
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,717
      but to work with it,      
   they need to soften it up,   

27
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,020
    so they steam the sticks    
         for 45 minutes.        

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,731
     then a craftsman places    
   the hickory stick in a jig.  

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,467
      in this steamy state,     
the wood is completely flexible.

30
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,404
     he easily curls one end    
     around a form by hand.     

31
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,544
  he loops wire around it so it 
  will hold its crooklike shape 

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,847
      while the wood dries      
         for one month.         

33
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:33,618
    at the end of that month,   

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,755
      he puts the other end     
  of the stick in a steamy jig  

35
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,224
        and bends it back       
      just below the crook.     

36
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,593
  this is called the back bend. 

37
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,535
      he sets it on a rack      
       to dry and harden.       

38
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,505
     this is the basic form,    

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,908
and as you can see, it resembles
      the bishop's crosier,     

40
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,878
      the one that inspired     
      the name of the game.     

41
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,994
   after two weeks of drying,   
the stick is ready to be carved.

42
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,965
  using a drawknife, he shaves  
    the bark from the stick.    

43
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,805
   then he sculpts it thinner,  

44
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,141
       following the bends      
          of the stick.         

45
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,875
    the carver is an artisan    

46
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,345
who has the experience and skill
      to do this job well,      

47
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,813
       which is important       

48
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,483
    because the stick must be   
 approved by the toughest judge,

49
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,785
           the player.          

50
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,634
      next they drill holes     
  in the curve of the stick --  

51
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,402
          21 in total.          

52
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,311
        then they give it       
        a heavy sanding.        

53
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,114
      the surface has to be     
        absolutely smooth       

54
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,617
          so the player         
    won't get any splinters.    

55
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,127
   then, using a rag, they rub  
   linseed oil into the stick   

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,664
        to keep the wood        
      from getting too dry.     

57
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,300
     the brand name goes on.    

58
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,072
and now it's time for the weaver

59
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,807
      to build the sidewall     
           of the net.          

60
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,676
        in the old days,        
   they used rawhide for this,  

61
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,213
      but today they weave      
       with nylon string.       

62
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,483
        he interlaces it        
      with leather runners      

63
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,453
 that have been threaded through
   the holes at the back bend.  

64
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,493
     he brushes polyurethane    
    on the completed side web   

65
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,994
         to stiffen it.         

66
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,366
 next he attaches the other end 
     of the leather runners     

67
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,834
    to the top of the crook.    

68
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,102
     the player will be able    

69
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,237
       to change the depth      
      of the netted pocket      

70
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,639
    to his or her preference.   

71
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,947
he interlaces the leather runner
weave with the nylon sidewall...

72
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,121
        ...and then pulls       
  the woven pocket over a post  

73
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,423
     to give it some shape.     

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,728
he loops the ends of the leather
     runners in a half hitch    

75
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,797
    and snips off the excess.   

76
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,471
  every detail of this lacrosse 
   stick has been handcrafted.  

77
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,208
         it's a process         
   that's taken three months.   

78
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,311
  and now let the games begin.  

79
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,158
            narrator:           
    since prehistoric times,    

80
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,361
      the innuit have used      
quick-freezing to preserve fish.

81
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,564
     they threw their catch     
       onto the arctic ice      

82
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,865
     to instantly freeze it.    

83
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,967
         it wasn't until        
     the early 20th century     

84
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,435
   that the rest of the world   

85
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,038
 discovered that this was better
       than slow freezing.      

86
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,175
     it's a case of progress    
    moving at a glacial pace.   

87
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,586
   fish that's rapidly frozen   
        right on the ship       

88
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,789
        is more flavorful       
    and retains its texture.    

89
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,658
this is minced cod frozen solid.

90
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,527
   it underwent quick-freezing  
            in china            

91
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,462
         and was shipped        
      in this frozen state      

92
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,065
           all the way          
  to this nova scotia facility  

93
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,501
  where it will be turned into  
          fish sticks.          

94
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,873
 a worker loads the fish blocks 
         into a machine.        

95
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,942
a powerful ram forces the blocks
         through knives,        

96
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,611
   which slice them into logs   

97
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,946
    that are about 19 inches    
           in length.           

98
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,393
      workers load the logs     
     vertically into slots.     

99
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,632
       below, more knives       
   slice the logs into sticks.  

100
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,235
     they get 85 fish sticks    
          from one log.         

101
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,640
  they check for breaks as the  
sticks move to the next station.

102
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,310
   at another production line,  

103
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,645
     they dump quick-frozen     
         haddock fillets        

104
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,181
    into a big, steel hopper.   

105
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,187
         it funnels them        
     to a flighted conveyor.    

106
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,192
 the conveyor meters the fillets

107
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,128
      and drops each bunch      
     onto a vibrating table.    

108
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,006
         the vibrations         
      separate the fillets      

109
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,675
   as they move into lanes...   

110
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,478
        and shuffle down        
    to an inspection station    

111
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,114
           where flaws          
     can be easily spotted.     

112
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,487
 now it's time for a hot shower.

113
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,689
     it lasts just a second.    

114
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,558
the hot water melts the fillets'
        protective glaze        

115
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,360
        but doesn't thaw        
        the fish itself.        

116
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,831
  deglazing allows the coating  
  mixture to stick to the fish. 

117
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,969
         the fish sticks        
        are now traveling       

118
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,436
   through a curtain of batter  

119
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,173
      made of flour, water,     
           and spices.          

120
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,515
       the excess collects      
         in a pan below         

121
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,050
      and coats the bottoms     
       of the fish sticks.      

122
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,523
       back on the haddock      
        production line,        

123
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,525
         they're loading        
      a toasted wheat blend     

124
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,127
into a machine called a breader.

125
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:53,064
    it creates a thick shower   
         of crumbs below        

126
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,468
  that evenly coats the fillets 
    as they journey through.    

127
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,380
then the breaded, frozen fillets
       head for the fryer.      

128
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,486
   the fish sticks go through   
  a fryer, too, for 28 seconds, 

129
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,422
        just long enough        
  to cook the outside coating,  

130
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,158
   but the fish remains frozen  
         on the inside.         

131
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,832
   with the coating baked on,   

132
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,037
 the fish sticks and fillets are
  now en route to the freezers. 

133
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,177
   meanwhile, over on a third   
        production line,        

134
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,181
  they dump oil and red peppers 
    into a high-speed mixer.    

135
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,650
      they add some parsley     
         for seasoning,         

136
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,454
        then hand-stir it       
      while it steam-cooks.     

137
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,258
      the red-pepper sauce      
  cascades from an applicator,  

138
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,394
     saturating these frozen    
        tilapia fillets.        

139
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,399
       this coating sticks      
      without being fried,      

140
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,134
     so the tilapia fillets     

141
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,805
          head straight         
   for the spiraling freezer.   

142
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,340
         the fish sticks        
   and breaded haddock fillets  

143
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,409
    are in similar freezers.    

144
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,745
        after 45 minutes,       

145
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,213
 the haddock slides down a chute

146
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,683
         which weighs it        
       to portion it out.       

147
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,853
   heated jaws seal the bagged  
        haddock fillets.        

148
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,365
 an oscillating feeder deposits 
   the fish sticks into boxes.  

149
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,304
       one last inspection      
  and they're ready for retail. 

150
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,508
        they vacuum-pack        
      the tilapia fillets,      

151
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,744
    and this meal is sealed.    

152
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,115
         and now there's        
     plenty of fish to fry,     

153
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,618
          depending on          
     where your tastes lie.     

154
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,298
    narrator: the flashlight    
  can illuminate any situation, 

155
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,534
 but the first version, invented
    in the late 19th century,   

156
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,003
   wasn't all that efficient.   

157
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,072
           it produced          
     only flashes of light,     

158
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,841
  so it was named "flashlight." 

159
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:34,358
 the flashlight shows us the way
      when things look dim.     

160
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,494
 to make a military flashlight, 

161
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,498
   they place an aluminum bar   
    in a computerized lathe.    

162
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:44,436
 blades go to work and shape it 
     into a flashlight body.    

163
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,308
 as a drill hollows out the bar,

164
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,511
   coolant flushes over it to   
prevent the metal from expanding

165
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,547
 as the tooling heats things up.

166
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,051
     this blade cuts threads    
         on the outside         

167
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,188
      so they can screw on      
  a flashlight lens cap later.  

168
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,125
a gripper now pulls out the tube

169
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,594
        so tools can work       
        on the back half.       

170
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,931
 a blade slims that section down

171
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,734
         and then carves        
    the cross weave onto it.    

172
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,945
  this heavy texture will make  
 the flashlight easier to grip. 

173
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:37,956
     next they drill a hole     
 in the flashlight's tail stud. 

174
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,059
       it's an attachment       
      for the wrist strap.      

175
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,299
    after the flashlight body   
        has taken shape,        

176
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,869
          they give it          
  a black, protective coating.  

177
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,040
   next, using tons of force,   

178
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,043
  a machine injects hot plastic 
          into a mold,          

179
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,013
      which forms the lens      
       for the flashlight.      

180
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:08,052
  they place the lens in a jig  
   and unscrew the mold core.   

181
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,321
   the core has formed threads  
           in the lens          

182
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,224
    so it can be screwed onto   
   the flashlight body later.   

183
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,931
 they use another injection mold

184
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,067
         to make plastic        
       flashlight bodies.       

185
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,335
     the plastic flashlights    

186
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,871
    are for more general use    
     than the aluminum ones.    

187
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,878
  for custom orders, they stamp 
   a logo onto the flashlight   

188
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,147
     using a hot-foil press.    

189
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:43,655
 next they insert light-emitting
  diodes into a circuit board.  

190
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,493
 the diodes are electronic lamps
      that are very bright      

191
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,031
   and can be used instead of   
 traditional incandescent bulbs.

192
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,769
     they solder the diodes'    
  lead wires to a circuit board 

193
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,372
       and then trim them       
         with snippers.         

194
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,847
 the diodes are now secured and 
 connected to the circuit board.

195
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,721
     for bigger flashlights,    
   they use a lot of diodes --  

196
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,190
        up to 60 of them        
       for this flashlight      

197
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,227
        that's being made       
   for search-and-rescue work.  

198
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:33,204
  next a stamping press shapes  
  the bronze battery contacts.  

199
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:37,175
      an ultrasonic welder      
 bonds them to a plastic plate. 

200
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,747
     then they solder a wire    
from the diodes to the contacts.

201
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,255
 the lamp part of the flashlight
          is now built.         

202
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,294
  now they insert springs into  
 the aluminum flashlight bodies.

203
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,568
    they load the batteries,    

204
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,070
         and the springs        
       hold them in place.      

205
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,776
  they slide the lamp assembly  
   into the flashlight cavity   

206
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,511
     and screw the lens on.     

207
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,581
    this aluminum flashlight    

208
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,116
   has just been put together   
           in a flash.          

209
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,786
          they move on          
   to the plastic flashlight.   

210
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,122
       the battery contact      
  and spring assembly goes in,  

211
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,725
   followed by the batteries.   

212
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,862
  the light-emitting diode lamp 
            is next.            

213
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,037
       they screw the lens      
         onto the lamp.         

214
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,344
    the plastic glare shield    
       is the final touch.      

215
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,415
    and now these flashlights   
       are ready to shine.      

216
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,101
            narrator:           
if you've got a paint job to do,

217
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,038
     the right type of brush    
  can make all the difference.  

218
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,773
  when you opt for latex paint, 

219
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,910
  it's best to use a paintbrush 
    with synthetic bristles.    

220
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,245
        they're typically       
   made of nylon or polyester.  

221
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,514
       if you're painting       
      with oil-based paint,     

222
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,583
           you can use          
    either a synthetic brush    

223
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,853
      or one with bristles      
  made of natural animal hair.  

224
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,460
      for natural bristles,     

225
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,129
   this factory uses pig hair   
       imported from china      

226
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,032
     that arrives in bundles    
        sorted by length.       

227
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,469
    each paintbrush contains    
  up to five different lengths. 

228
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,872
  this bristle structure makes  
  the brush sufficiently stiff. 

229
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,143
        all five lengths        

230
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,945
  go into a specially designed  
         mixing machine.        

231
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,481
  first it combs the bristles,  

232
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,483
     straightening them out     
 and removing any curved hairs. 

233
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,752
         then it spreads        
        the bristles flat       

234
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,155
 and mixes the lengths together.

235
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,097
  now a worker takes a handful  
   of bristles from the mixer   

236
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,965
          and pats them         
      on a vibrating table.     

237
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,701
 like human hairs, animal hairs 
     have a root and a tip.     

238
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,706
       the vibrations make      
 all the butt ends line up flat.

239
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,044
          each handful          
     goes into a storage box    

240
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,780
   until it's time to install   
  the bristles in the ferrule,  

241
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,750
         the steel band         
that goes around the paintbrush.

242
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,456
this machine makes the ferrules.

243
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:44,261
  it shapes a thin steel strip  
 that's 1.1 to 1.6 inches wide. 

244
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,565
      rollers imprint beads     
  to make the strip more rigid  

245
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,435
    and a herringbone pattern   
    that is purely cosmetic.    

246
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,338
   then a blade cuts the strip  
           into pieces          

247
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,008
      that are long enough      
    to wrap around the brush.   

248
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,880
  the machine bends each piece  
     around a forming horn,     

249
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,984
       then joins the ends      
     in a strong lock seam.     

250
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,858
    hammers flatten the seam,   
  and the ferrule is finished.  

251
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,631
    back to the bristles now.   

252
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:24,035
     a brush-making machine     
 will join them to the ferrules.

253
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,170
          workers load          
  the mixed batches of bristles 

254
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,972
    into one of the machine's   
             feeders            

255
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,274
and the ferrules into the other.

256
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:37,115
      the machine picks up      
the required amount of bristles.

257
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,518
   transfer jaws grab the tips  
  and insert them in a ferrule. 

258
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,586
       a vibrating device       
         called a patter        

259
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,422
pushes the bristles in straight.

260
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,864
 a continuous strip of cardboard

261
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,067
       feeds the next part      
        of the equipment.       

262
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,069
 the machine parts the bristles,
            cuts off,           

263
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,070
          and slots in          
      a piece of cardboard.     

264
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,006
        this centerpiece,       
         as it's called,        

265
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,074
         creates a well         
      inside the brush head     

266
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,944
     to help hold the paint.    

267
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,413
           the machine          
   then pulls the bristles out  

268
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,747
      to the proper length,     

269
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,751
  leaving about a quarter inch  
       inside the ferrule.      

270
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,288
      once the brush heads      
      come off the machine,     

271
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,423
        workers pick out        
       the loose bristles.      

272
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,293
         the lightweight        
       paintbrush handles       

273
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,163
  are made of plastic pellets.  

274
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,697
         a vacuum loader        

275
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,833
       sucks the material       
     up to a molding machine    

276
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,769
     which melts the pellets    
at about 400 degrees fahrenheit.

277
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,705
    the machine then injects    
       the molten plastic       

278
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,707
    into handle-shaped molds.   

279
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,975
       five minutes later,      

280
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,811
 the machine ejects the handles 
         from the molds.        

281
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,785
         workers attach         
 30 handles at a time to sticks 

282
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,854
and hang them across paint vats,

283
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,323
     then lower the handles     
      into the paint slowly     

284
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,792
 to avoid creating air bubbles. 

285
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,628
   the first coat is a primer.  

286
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,265
 after a half-hour, the handles 
  are ready for the next coat.  

287
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,936
   this time, the vat contains  
         colored paint.         

288
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,673
   it dries to a matte finish   
         in 30 minutes.         

289
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,076
          the third vat         
     contains clear lacquer.    

290
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,713
  this coat protects the paint  
  and makes the surface glossy. 

291
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:22,152
      now it's time to glue     
  the bristles to the ferrules  

292
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,221
     with strong epoxy glue.    

293
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,624
          it seeps down         
     into the bristle base.     

294
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,164
  workers now load the finished 
     brush heads and handles    

295
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,968
    into an assembly machine.   

296
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,439
  the machine inserts a handle  
      into each brush head,     

297
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,543
   shooting two or three nails  
  into each side to secure it.  

298
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,085
   finally, a printing machine  
     stamps the company name    

299
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,654
  onto one side of each handle. 

300
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,924
   paintbrushes come in a wide  
range of widths and thicknesses,

301
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:04,228
   providing different strokes  
      for different folks.      

302
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,738
