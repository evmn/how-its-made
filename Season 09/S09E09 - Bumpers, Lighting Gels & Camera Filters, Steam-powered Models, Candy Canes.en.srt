narrator: today on "how it's made"...

00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:25,958
bumpers...

...and candy canes.      

8
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,655
with all the attention we pay to our car's high-tech parts, 

9
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,790
it's easy to overlook the importance   

10
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,725
of a vehicle's bumpers.    

11
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,729
about 80% of car accidents are front or rear collisions. 

12
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,267
the bumper is designed to absorb
the force of the impact,    

13
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,969
minimizing damage in low-speed collisions.    

14
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:20,345
bumpers can be made of plastic,
fiberglass, aluminum, or steel.

15
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,881
this company makes steel bumpers.      

16
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,816
they start out as blanks,   

17
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,820
steel sheets just 8/100 of an inch thick.  

18
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,956
these are en route to becoming truck bumpers.   

19
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:35,160
a robot feeds each blank through
a series of seven to nine dies,

20
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,996
depending on the bumper model. 

21
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,467
each die stamps the blank into a particular shape,    

22
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,570
using some 2,000 tons of force.

23
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,906
this progressively forms the blank        

24
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,808
into the final bumper shape.  

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,718
both the front and rear bumpers
go through the same process,  

26
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,787
only with different dies.   

27
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,060
the bumpers now travel to the next production area,  

28
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:11,863
where a worker clamps each one onto a specially designed cart.

29
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,534
at this point, the factory paints certain models.     

30
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,003
these bumpers will get chrome plating.    

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,707
but first they travel through a series of buffing wheels.  

32
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,015
the bumper surface must be impeccably smooth   

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,216
because the chrome finish   

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,586
magnifies even the tiniest flaws.       

35
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,958
a computer-guided crane stacks the bumpers       

36
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,195
and maneuvers them through the chrome-plating process.  

37
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,301
first it submerges the bumpers in several cleaning tanks   

38
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,637
to remove any residue left on the surface      

39
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,440
from previous operations.   

40
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,976
the company won't divulge what chemicals it uses     

41
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,111
to clean the steel       

42
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,979
because this surface preparation

43
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,382
is the secret to first-rate metal plating.  

44
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,723
the first plating tank applies a coat of nickel    

45
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,459
to protect the steel from corrosion.        

46
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,795
the next tank applies the chrome layer.   

47
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,665
the factory uses the standard electroplating process.    

48
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,734
in a water-and-chemical-filled tank,             

49
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,536
the plating metal particles get a positive charge     

50
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,740
while a negative charge runs through the bumpers.   

51
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:32,210
this magnetically draws the particles onto the bumpers 

52
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,612
in an even layer.       

53
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,484
after a thorough rinse, the bumpers are inspected.   

54
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,020
workers scrutinize the chrome-mirror finish    

55
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,323
under high-intensity light.  

56
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:50,361
meanwhile, this machine pressure injects molten plastic

57
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,763
into various molds.      

58
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,598
a built-in cooling system   

59
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,167
hardens the plastic within seconds.        

60
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,970
then out comes the plastic components     

61
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,306
that attach to the bumpers.  

62
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,976
one of those plastic parts is this step pad        

63
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,511
that covers the top of the rear bumper.      

64
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,979
once the pad's in place,    

65
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,648
a worker attaches a built-in trailer hitch.   

66
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,650
steel mounting brackets    

67
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:16,120
help structurally reinforce the bumper.          

68
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,990
the front bumper goes down a different assembly line.   

69
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,193
a worker attaches a plastic trim

70
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,528
that hangs down just below the bumper.     

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,997
its aerodynamic shape helps direct air flow     

72
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,399
to the engine compartment.   

73
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,068
next, four steel reinforcing brackets      

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,338
that will attach the bumper to the truck's frame.     

75
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:50,489
and, finally, the license-plate holder...  

76
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,557
and fog lamps.         

77
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,832
workers tighten all the bolts to a specified tightness.   

78
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,236
this ensures that the bumper and its mounting brackets   

79
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,306
will adequately absorb the force of the collision.  

80
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,312
whenever a new model goes into production,     

81
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,248
the first few bumpers off the line          

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,716
go through a battery of tests 

83
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,252
to prove they can withstand stress, vibration,       

84
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:24,456
and a certain degree of what engineers call crash energy.  

85
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,192
other types of bumper systems use a combination of springs  

86
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,529
and energy-absorbing material, such as plastic foam.     

87
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,931
with either method,      

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,267
the goal is for the bumper to absorb the impact.     

89
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,869
in a low-impact crash,     

90
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,005
this should ideally confine  
the damage to the bumper itself,

91
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,541
leaving the headlights, the engine,          

92
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,277
and the driver unscathed.   

93
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,286
up next, some colorful products

94
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,988
that set the stage in a whole new light.     

95
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,092
narrator: gels and filters   

96
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,028
can turn a bad scene into a beautiful one.     

97
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,431
they're used in theater productions     

98
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,501
to enhance the mood on stage. 

99
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,770
they're also used in film and photography    

100
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,906
to adjust color temperatures from different light sources. 

101
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,317
these lighting gels can make any
scene take on a different mood.

102
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,254
they're called gels because they
used to be made of gelatin film,

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,558
but today they are made out of transparent polyester. 

104
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,195
the process begins       

105
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:41,199
with a mix of solvent, dye, and flame-retardant chemicals. 

106
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,568
this produces a colored lacquer.

107
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,010
a worker tests the lacquer's thickness    

108
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,480
by pouring it into a brass cup with a hole in the bottom.   

109
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,549
as the lacquer drains out of the hole, it's timed.    

110
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,820
if it flows too quickly, the lacquer is too thin,    

111
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,889
and if it drains too slowly, it's too thick.        

112
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,491
a steady flow         

113
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,093
means the lacquer mix is the perfect consistency -- 

114
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,695
about as thick as engine oil. 

115
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:15,166
a sample of every batch undergoes this test      

116
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,370
because the lacquer's consistency is critical.    

117
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,906
if the factory doesn't get it right,     

118
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,241
it won't bond to the clear polyester.    

119
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,712
with the lacquer prepared,   

120
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,116
workers load the polyester film
into the coating machine.   

121
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,459
a big roller soaks up lacquer from a tray below       

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
and spreads it on the film.  

123
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,268
a thin bar on the roller evens the spread 

124
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,636
and scrapes off the excess.  

125
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,942
the lacquer dries in seconds. 

126
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,477
every production run of the same color       

127
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,546
has to precisely match the last,

128
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,683
so inspectors regularly test the lacquer's hue       

129
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,685
on swatches of clear polyester.

130
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,357
if gel colors are even slightly mismatched, 

131
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,727
using them together will make for a patchy-looking job.   

132
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,704
differently colored gels create different effects.   

133
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,910
this orangey red one will warm up daylight     

134
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,346
to look more like indoor lighting.        

135
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,594
now, in a test, a gel swatch is held over a flame.     

136
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,330
the gel burns but never catches fire --   

137
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,665
proving that this batch is ready
for the hot lights       

138
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,067
of a movie set.        

139
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,276
over at another station,    

140
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,412
they're working on a different sort of color-changer --    

141
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,681
a filter that goes on a camera lens.     

142
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,551
a special sheet of optical plastic       

143
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,553
is dipped in hot water and dye.

144
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,155
the hot water opens the plastic's pores,   

145
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,158
allowing the dye to penetrate. 

146
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,826
when the plastic cools,    

147
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,362
the color will be trapped inside.    

148
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,831
the longer the plastic stays in the dye bath,     

149
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,634
the deeper the color.     

150
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,037
some sheets only get partially dyed.    

151
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,905
they'll be turned into filters 

152
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,976
that affect only half an image's exposure.      

153
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,978
filters made from a range of colors     

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,312
will help the camera's eye   

155
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,715
do what the human eye does effortlessly --      

156
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,951
adjust to different lighting conditions.      

157
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,794
the colored sheets are sheathed
in thin plastic.        

158
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,264
this prevents scratching as they're cut to size.    

159
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,342
these camera filters are nearly done.        

160
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,446
all that's left is for the ink-jet printer to brand them. 

161
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,159
a similar type of printer   

162
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,695
gives the lighting gels their trademark stamp.     

163
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,364
and now it's time to wrap things up.       

164
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,834
a cardboard core slides into a machine         

165
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,037
that winds the finished gel sheets onto it.      

166
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,040
then a pneumatic ram pushes the roll of lighting gel    

167
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,609
into a plastic bag.      

168
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,914
now these filters and gels are ready to show life     

169
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,083
in the best light possible.  

170
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,724
when we return,        

171
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,394
making tiny models that are a blast from the past.

172
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,866
narrator: when factories build live steam models,    

173
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,269
they're reconstructing history.

174
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:16,407
these working steam models take us on a nostalgic journey,

175
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,377
and they're fun for hobbyists of all ages.   

176
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,888
add a little water...     

177
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,025
light some fuel for the boiler...       

178
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,560
and it's full steam ahead   

179
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,897
for this mini replica of a 19th-century road locomotive.

180
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,640
production starts with the boiler.        

181
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:53,011
a hydraulic press repeatedly punches a piece of brass,   

182
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,880
stretching the brass cap into a cylinder.        

183
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,518
it's a process called drawing, 

184
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,921
and it also strengthens the metal.           

185
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,662
a flat piece of brass is transformed into a cylinder 

186
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:14,065
in only a few minutes.     

187
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,402
next the ends of the cylinder are trimmed.          

188
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,937
solder paste is brushed onto a brass cap  

189
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,874
and slotted into a holding device.     

190
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,349
paste goes onto attachments inside the cylindrical boiler. 

191
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:36,054
then the boiler and cap are press-fitted together.   

192
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,028
the cap boilers travel through a furnace,       

193
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,632
which melts the solder paste, 
fusing the caps to the cylinder.

194
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,404
workers polish the brass to give it a nice sheen.    

195
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,646
then they solder copper pipes to the boiler.         

196
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,648
these pipes will expel the steam

197
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,084
as it powers this little locomotive.    

198
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,994
next up -- trimming the flywheel,     

199
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,563
which has been precast.    

200
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,803
the flywheel will smooth out the engine's firing impulses  

201
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,505
so that it runs more evenly.  

202
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,579
the flywheel is tightly screwed
to the crank shaft.      

203
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,553
workers check the sliding action
of the piston and its cylinder.

204
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,089
then they attach the assembly 

205
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,026
to the engine frame and the crank shaft.      

206
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,365
lubricating the piston assembly
enhances its sliding action.  

207
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,439
using compressed air,     

208
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,376
workers make sure the engine functions and has no leaks.  

209
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,714
once the model passes the test,

210
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,851
it gets its front steering mechanism.      

211
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,186
this will control the model's front wheels    

212
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,288
while the back wheels power it forward.       

213
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,427
steam machines are usually rear-wheel drive. 

214
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,268
a wire called the drive band transfers the energy      

215
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,637
from the flywheel to the rear wheel.       

216
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,079
the steam model        

217
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,481
is hooked up to the compressed air tank once again      

218
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,283
for a final test run.     

219
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:49,721
and it looks like this model is ready for some action.   

220
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,358
all it needs is a canopy to provide a little shade.   

221
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,863
a ribbed design is punched into a little steel roof.   

222
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,436
after it gets a nice paint job,
it's attached to the model.  

223
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,709
production on this tiny treasure
is now complete.        

224
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,248
this model will also take you back in time,     

225
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,716
but in high style.       

226
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,618
it's a luxury touring car.   

227
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,536
workers install the piston cylinder assembly  

228
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,006
a little lower on this roadster
and fire it up.        

229
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,283
each of these mini steam models
is a tribute to the original  

230
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,151
and give us all a glimpse   

231
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,587
into the colorful history of transportation.       

232
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,962
coming up...          

233
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,932
turning sugar into one of our favorite holiday treats.

234
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,837
narrator: in the 17th century,      

235
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,238
a german choirmaster      

236
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,707
had some sugar sticks bent into shepherd's crooks  

237
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,844
as a special treat for his choir.         

238
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:24,048
and that's how the candy cane is
believed to have been invented.

239
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,717
but it wasn't until more than a century later      

240
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,486
that they earned their stripes.

241
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:39,330
today candy canes come in all different colors and sizes.

242
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,266
candymakers start by cooking up a big batch   

243
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,036
of sugar, water, and corn syrup.

244
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,143
next, they prepare a mix of starch and flavoring,    

245
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,480
like peppermint or strawberry. 

246
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,415
as they blend together,    

247
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,617
the flavoring binds to the starch.         

248
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,219
the flavoring mix       

249
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,888
is emptied into the middle of a syrupy slab.       

250
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,492
then the whole thing is fed into a machine     

251
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,962
that folds the batch repeatedly
using shovels and a plunger.  

252
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:15,033
this distributes the flavoring evenly.     

253
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,114
cold water is piped into the shovels and the kneading table 

254
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,616
to cool the candy-cane mix   

255
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,918
so it takes on the stiffer consistency    

256
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,754
that's necessary for the next step.       

257
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,726
now it's over to the automated pullers.   

258
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,463
these pullers stretch     
the mixture around a metal post.

259
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,866
this action aerates the candy, turning it white.       

260
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,802
this batch will make 3,200 candy canes,  

261
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,006
but there's still a lot more work to be done.  

262
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,484
the candy is rolled into a fat log,        

263
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,821
while heaters warm it until its pliable enough to shape.  

264
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:20,698
next, strips of red-colored candy are rolled out.     

265
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,537
a worker stretches and folds it
to widen the strip.      

266
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,446
two of the red strips are arranged          

267
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,315
on either side of the white candy.      

268
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,120
it weighs 100 pounds,     

269
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,457
so it takes two workers to   
transfer it to the next machine.

270
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,528
it's called a batch roller,  

271
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,531
and its cylinders roll the candy
thinner and thinner,      

272
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,066
dramatically reducing the log's diameter       

273
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,936
until it reaches candy-cane dimensions.     

274
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,139
a torch moves across the candy to keep it pliable.      

275
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,808
then the sugary batch travels between wheels     

276
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,577
that slim it down even more.  

277
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,682
the rope of candy moves forward
in a wave-like fashion.    

278
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,285
this gives it some slack so it doesn't stretch     

279
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,288
as it moves through the next set of wheels.    

280
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,065
the candy rope moves through two angled belts that twist it,

281
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:32,570
and a chain of knives cut the 
twisted rope to candy-cane size.

282
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,976
this production has been perfectly choreographed.    

283
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:43,247
one misstep, and the job would hit a snarl. 

284
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,652
here, a roll of cellophane unwinds,     

285
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,521
and a device wraps it around the candy sticks.    

286
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,924
a blast of hot air shrinks the cellophane     

287
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:54,992
on the ends of the canes.   

288
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,199
now it's time for these candy sticks     

289
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,001
to get their signature crooks. 

290
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,840
this machine, called a crooker deck, bends the ends.

291
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,413
an overhead bracket brush gently secures the canes    

292
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,883
because though they're pliable enough to bend,

293
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,451
they're still fragile.     

294
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,561
there's a camera inside this robotic arm,    

295
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,631
which allows it to spot the  
candy canes on the conveyer belt

296
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,499
and pick them up two at a time.         

297
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,974
it places them in cardboard packages by the dozen.     

298
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,184
it takes about half an hour to make a box of candy canes. 

299
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,788
and they're sure to come to a very sticky end      

300
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,223
in even less time.
