00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,454
narrator: the angle grinder created a major buzz       

4
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,256
in the workplace when it was developed      

5
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,791
in the middle of the 20th century.       

6
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,660
this power tool could do it all --        

7
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,464
cut, grind, and polish metal or stone.         

8
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,667
just change the disk or brush attachment       

9
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:09,068
to match the job,        

10
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,637
and work gets done automatically.          

11
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,342
with numerous attachments available,      

12
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:17,743
the angle grinder        

13
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,478
could be equipped for many different jobs.     

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,880
that makes it one of the most useful things    

15
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,817
on any job site.         

16
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,752
making angle grinders starts   

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,556
with these blocks of pure aluminum.        

18
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,823
fired in a furnace,       

19
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,695
the aluminum melts into a liquid form.       

20
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:38,096
the factory casts the molten aluminum       

21
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,266
to create gear housings.     

22
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,037
a robot transfers one of the gear housings     

23
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,173
to a milling station       

24
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,476
and then retrieves a finished part.         

25
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,781
the door of the machine closes,             

26
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,050
and a computerized cutter carves threads          

27
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,186
into the center bearing seat   

28
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:03,189
and generally improves the profile of the part.     

29
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:10,062
next up is the rotor for the electric motor.     

30
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:13,466
an automated system pushes special cardboard end disks   

31
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,535
onto the rotor shaft.      

32
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:20,539
the part on the right is equipped with end disks.   

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,376
the system now installs a part  

34
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,278
called the collector on one end.              

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,879
made of copper and plastic,   

36
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,816
the collector will transmit power to the rotor        

37
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,152
and ensure that the grinding or polishing attachment     

38
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,220
can turn.            

39
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:42,294
the part on the right has had the collector installed.           

40
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,563
spinning arms wind copper wire  

41
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,433
into grooves in the rotor at both ends.          

42
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,369
the wire will serve as an electromagnet       

43
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,338
and maximize power output.    

44
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,110
moving forward, the system inserts covers    

45
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,313
into slots in the rotor wall.  

46
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,048
they both insulate the rotor   

47
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,451
and stabilize the copper coil.  

48
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,853
spinning devices wrap copper wire         

49
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,255
around each half of the stater.             

50
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,792
this stater creates the electromagnetic field    

51
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,160
around the rotor.        

52
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,797
a robot puts the two halves   

53
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,266
of the stater together in a fixture,      

54
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:22,902
and welds make the assembly permanent.     

55
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:32,144
over to an injection molding machine now,       

56
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:37,282
it forms plastic into outer casings for the grinder.     

57
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:41,553
a robot transfers the casing to a platform for printing.   

58
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,024
this stamp adds silver ink to the embossed company logo,  

59
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,259
giving it greater visual appeal.             

60
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,966
a worker then slides the plastic housing over the stater,     

61
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:57,203
and a pneumatic machine press-fits the two together.   

62
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,108
the worker then wires the on/off switch        

63
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,176
for the angle grinder.      

64
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,513
the gear housing has, by now, been equipped      

65
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,116
with a drive gear and brake.   

66
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,186
he installs the gear system on one end of the rotor.     

67
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,325
he then inserts the rotor assembly in the stater.     

68
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,198
an automated system screws everything together    

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,068
to complete the angle grinder motor.     

70
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,007
next, a nozzle fills the gear head with grease.    

71
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,542
a worker places the spindle   

72
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,744
and safety clutch over the gear head,       

73
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,681
and a mechanized system screws it in place.       

74
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,889
she then wires the electrical plug       

75
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,958
to the angle grinder motor.   

76
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,503
she encloses the electrical wiring with a plastic cover.   

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,510
she locks the cover in places with screws,      

78
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,313
using a metal template to aid in their placement.    

79
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,452
this angle grinder        

80
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:25,057
is now ready to undergo quality control tests.      

81
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,326
this one depresses the angle grinder switch,    

82
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,927
while a computerized system   

83
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:33,065
analyzes the motor's performance.           

84
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,800
if it passes all the tests,   

85
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,136
the angle grinder is ready to take a chunk     

86
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,071
out of someone's workload.    

87
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,387
narrator: long before the development of pottery,   

88
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:59,258
people looked to the forest for containment materials.    

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,995
they made berry baskets from the bark of birch trees.  

90
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,597
the baskets were lightweight and waterproof,   

91
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,999
due to natural resins in the bark.       

92
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,467
the making of these baskets   

93
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,570
is a tradition that carries on.               

94
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,875
for containing nature's bounty,             

95
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,544
birch bark is a natural choice.             

96
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,880
this berry basket is made entirely         

97
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,083
from materials found in nature.             

98
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,019
making one starts with birch bark         

99
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,088
that's been carefully pried off the tree        

100
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,491
to avoid damage to the inner layer of bark.   

101
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,561
this cardboard pattern will be used as a template.   

102
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,965
the basket maker examines the bark        

103
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,968
for any holes or serious flaws.             

104
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,903
he flips the bark over.     

105
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,574
he'll use the inner side    
for the outside of the basket.  

106
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,845
he traces around the pattern,  

107
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,316
using a scribe that lightly scores the bark.     

108
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:00,853
this light scoring creates   
a visible outline on the bark.  

109
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,924
using scissors for cutting leather,       

110
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,592
he follows the pattern lines   

111
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,664
to cut the bark to the pattern shape.      

112
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,666
the contours are harder to follow,      

113
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,267
so he switches to scissors    

114
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,071
with curved blades to cut them out.         

115
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:21,940
he punches holes in the basket corners.      

116
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,342
this will stop the bark from splitting in these spots  

117
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,678
when it's folded.        

118
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,416
using a pointed instrument known as a divider,       

119
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,887
he now etches stitch lines around the perimeter.      

120
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,689
he maps out the location for the stitch holes       

121
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:41,093
by lightly piercing the bark along the etched lines.     

122
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,764
using a ruler for support,    

123
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,300
he bends the flaps of the pattern up,        

124
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,637
creating creases that will become permanent folds later.  

125
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,176
he punches out stitch holes   

126
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:59,411
where he had lightly pierced the bark.        

127
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,985
he drapes a damp towel over the birch bark       

128
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,055
and irons it.          

129
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,991
this softens the bark so that it doesn't split     

130
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,528
as he now forms the final bends along the crease lines.     

131
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,933
he overlaps the ends of the basket.          

132
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,869
he clips the structure to hold it together       

133
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,373
while he inserts wooden dowels in some of the stitch holes.   

134
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,946
once the dowels are in, he removes the clips.      

135
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,950
the dowels will keep the basket together for stitching.     

136
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,684
but first, he tapers the stem  

137
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,155
from a willow shrub using a wood plane.       

138
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:45,891
he inserts the stem in a cylindrical container    

139
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,828
and fills the cylinder with hot water.         

140
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,631
the tapered stem soaks overnight.         

141
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:56,434
it softens and becomes extremely flexible.       

142
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,639
using a wooden form, he shapes the stem into a ring.              

143
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,575
the tapered ends overlap for a consistent thickness    

144
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,244
all the way around.       

145
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,183
he clips the ring        
to the inner rim of the basket  

146
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:15,653
and also tacks it in place with a few stitches.       

147
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,522
this willow ring will add support         

148
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,425
to the lip of the berry basket.             

149
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,464
next, he stitches the seams together        

150
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,734
using the root of a spruce tree for thread.           

151
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:33,338
its tapered tip serves as a needle.           

152
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,739
he does precise backstitches   

153
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,142
and ensures all the seams are tight.       

154
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,416
moving back to the rim of the basket,          

155
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,952
he punctures the bark just below the willow ring,   

156
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,221
creating a row of holes     

157
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,223
to loop the root around the rim.         

158
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,695
this spruce root wrap protects the rim ring,      

159
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,732
and gives the basket a more finished look at the top.              

160
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,639
he slices a piece of cedar bark              

161
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,842
into long, narrow strips.    

162
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,314
he'll use these strips to make a handle for the basket.     

163
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,353
he weaves the cedar into a five-strand braid.    

164
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,192
he loops the cedar braid at the ends        

165
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,261
and uses the loops to stitch the handle       

166
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:30,696
to the berry basket.       

167
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,668
it takes this artisan about a day           

168
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,304
to craft a birch bark berry basket.          

169
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,409
his efforts will no doubt    

170
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,479
bear fruit for many years to come.     

171
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,032
narrator: choosing the right  
speakers for your sound system  

172
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,502
depends on how you prefer to hear music.          

173
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:15,240
unidirectional speakers radiate sound in a single direction.   

174
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,577
omnidirectional speakers radiate in all directions,        

175
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,446
so the sound bounces off the ceiling and walls.    

176
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:28,052
this omnidirectional speaker system has four towers --    

177
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,524
two main system towers and two subwoofer towers.    

178
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,392
the towers contain the drivers  

179
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:38,196
that radiate sound frequencies out of the speaker.       

180
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,732
this computer-guided mill shapes brass sheets       

181
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:44,736
into mounting plates for the main system towers.   

182
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:48,340
each of the main system towers contains six drivers --     

183
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:52,744
two tweeters, two mid-ranges, and two woofers.         

184
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,213
each subwoofer tower contains six drivers       

185
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,217
for the lowest human audible frequencies.       

186
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,087
after the brass mounting plate comes off the mill,       

187
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:04,289
workers grind the top surface smooth      

188
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,858
to prepare it for polishing and chrome plating.       

189
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,363
the mill then shapes brass rings.       

190
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,699
these are bases for the woofers,            

191
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,901
which fit an opening in the mounting plate.      

192
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,504
brass is the metal of choice for these parts,    

193
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,641
due to its acoustical properties.           

194
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,444
for aesthetics, the rings are painted black,        

195
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:27,179
and the mounting plates are electro-plated        

196
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,782
with galvanized chrome.     

197
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,517
in this part of the plant,    

198
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,787
they build tweeters for the main system towers.   

199
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,322
the first step is to lay strips             

200
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,724
of resin-impregnated carbon fiber           

201
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:43,528
in semi-circular molds.     

202
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,330
after removing the protective film       

203
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,998
that covers the carbon fiber,  

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,669
they lay foil strips at each end.           

205
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,204
these will direct heat from the oven          

206
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,739
to the carbon fiber strips    

207
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,275
and prevent the resin from flowing out.        

208
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:03,014
they assemble the molds and clamp them shut.       

209
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,217
they place the molds in an oven for 45 minutes    

210
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,087
at a programmed series of temperatures.         

211
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,556
this heats the resin in the carbon fiber,       

212
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,726
stiffening and forming the strips to the mold shape.  

213
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:18,297
using a punch press,       

214
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,299
workers slice each carbon fiber strip     

215
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,467
into several thinner strips.   

216
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,176
they construct each tweeter   

217
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,245
by gluing 24 of those thin strips       

218
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,113
to the tweeter's voice coil,   

219
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,516
a ring made of wound copper wire.        

220
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,255
they brush silicone in between the strips,      

221
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,791
coat the entire surface with more silicone,       

222
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:48,593
then place an aluminum cover plate on top.       

223
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:54,132
they construct each mid-range driver the same way,       

224
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,734
but with carbon fiber strips   

225
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,736
that are thicker and stiffer   

226
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,871
and therefore radiate lower frequencies better     

227
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,041
than the thinner, more flexible tweeter strips.  

228
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,812
placing the strips with tweezers            

229
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,282
and aligning them properly with a toothpick         

230
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:14,152
requires a good eye, excellent dexterity,       

231
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,121
and a lot of experience.     

232
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,792
like the tweeter, the mid-range driver       

233
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,628
goes into an oven for 45 minutes          

234
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,198
through a specific cycle of temperatures.         

235
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,440
once the driver comes out of the oven and cools,      

236
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,576
they glue strips of sound-dampening foam     

237
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:39,244
to the inside,          

238
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,981
sealing the gaps between the carbon fiber strips.     

239
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,583
this prevents sound from radiating inward      

240
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,386
rather than out the speaker.   

241
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,855
they solder the cables      

242
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,724
that bring the incoming electrical signal        

243
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,260
that carries the sound frequencies.      

244
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,463
that signal moves the voice coil up        

245
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,999
while the driver's magnet moves it back down.       

246
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,802
the repeated up and down motion             

247
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,471
flexes the carbon fiber strips,             

248
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,608
radiating the sound frequencies.          

249
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,411
after installing a center rod made of carbon,         

250
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,080
workers stuff the hollow space inside the driver        

251
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,016
with sound-dampening wool.    

252
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,351
they pour lubricating oil    

253
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,154
into a narrow gap in the driver's magnet,     

254
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,690
then insert the voice coil into the gap.          

255
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,692
the oil contains iron,      

256
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,362
so it conducts the electrical signal to the coil.       

257
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,633
they screw an aluminum mounting plate          

258
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,468
to the magnet's posts...     

259
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,340
...then apply a disk of a stiff sound-dampening material.    

260
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,380
they install the tweeter's magnet on the mounting plate,  

261
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,982
feeding the tweeter's electrical cables,        

262
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,319
not yet soldered to the tweeter, through the center rod.     

263
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,124
next they'll make the woofers.  

264
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,808
narrator: the sound system's amplifier  

265
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,344
that carries all the sound frequencies.      

266
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,746
inside each main system speaker,            

267
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,882
an electronic component called the crossover       

268
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,684
separates the frequency ranges  

269
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:28,352
and sends them, via designated cables,      

270
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,155
to the appropriate driver.    

271
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,360
they make each melon-shaped woofer       

272
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,695
out of 12 aluminum segments.   

273
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,565
they glue acoustic foam to each segment,         

274
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,201
then trim the foam to the shape of the aluminum.  

275
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,906
workers assemble the woofer upside-down           

276
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,442
in an assembly fixture.     

277
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,842
they glue the segments vertically            

278
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,645
between this woofer's voice coil,           

279
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,647
which has two cables attached to it          

280
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,382
and a mounting plate.      

281
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,850
the structural rod        

282
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,653
through which they'll feed the other driver's cables    

283
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,288
is in the center.        

284
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,129
once all the segments are aligned and fixed in place,             

285
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,064
they coat the edges with glue.  

286
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,804
then they adhere rubber gaskets in between the segments     

287
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,240
to block the gaps and prevent air from exiting.  

288
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,749
they seat copper strips in the segment's grooves,    

289
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:36,288
hooking the ends into holes at the top and bottom.      

290
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,824
brass, aluminum, copper -- every type of material used   

291
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:44,029
in these speakers has specific acoustical properties.      

292
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:47,666
the combination produces a natural sound balance.     

293
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,103
they fill the hollow interior space          

294
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:56,240
around the center rod      
with sound-dampening material.  

295
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,376
first, synthetic insulating wool              

296
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,778
with long, coarse fibers.    

297
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,380
then, on top of that,      

298
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,515
a barrier of cotton-insulating wool    

299
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,183
to prevent those coarse fibers  

300
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,053
from touching the voice coil.  

301
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,724
next, they install the painted brass ring      

302
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:14,125
they milled earlier,       

303
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:18,396
which now has the woofer's magnet fixed to it.       

304
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,534
they place a spacer, thread a screw,         

305
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,737
pull the voice coil's two cables through the center,    

306
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,338
then solder those cables,    

307
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,407
together with the cables from the other drivers,     

308
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,611
to a main cable that will plug into the crossover.       

309
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,549
they flip the woofer right side up          

310
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,885
and pour a liquid sound-dampening compound     

311
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,555
into the center rod.       

312
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,490
the cables inside are too delicate         

313
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,525
to be shoving in insulating wool.         

314
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,830
workers now begin assembling the speaker,     

315
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,966
first soldering the two remaining crossover cables,   

316
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,635
mid-range and high frequency,  

317
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,905
to the respective driver cables.             

318
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,239
the tweeter connection cables  

319
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,241
are attached to the tweeter magnet,      

320
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,712
installed earlier on top of the mid-range driver.     

321
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:12,183
they now mount this unit on top of the woofer.      

322
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:15,253
they install the connectors in the crossover.        

323
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,323
its electrical components separate the frequency ranges  

324
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:22,127
and send each one to a designated connector,    

325
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,261
which sends it to the cable   

326
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,530
leading to the appropriate driver.     

327
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,267
after sliding the crossover onto the speaker's base,     

328
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,335
made of milled brass,      

329
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,805
they close up the top with the mounting plates,    

330
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,807
between which they've since sandwiched         

331
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,008
a thick piece of wood.      

332
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,144
screw-in stainless steel support posts          

333
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,612
hold everything together     

334
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,748
and direct all the weight down to the floor,        

335
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,418
rather than into the speaker structure.      

336
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,089
they install an aluminum crossbar       

337
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,357
for structural support,     

338
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,794
then a second set of posts.   

339
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,199
they fit the ring at the base of the woofer    

340
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,736
into the mounting plate hole, securing it with screws.     

341
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,176
they insert the tweeter's voice coil into the tweeter magnet   

342
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,978
that's mounted on top of the mid-range driver     

343
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,448
that's mounted on top of the woofer.      

344
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,315
they solder the tweeter cables  

345
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,652
to the two connectors on the tweeter cover plate.   

346
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,723
this completes the lower trio of drivers.    

347
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,192
now they install an identical upper trio,     

348
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,994
but upside-down         

349
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,996
so that the two tweeters face each other         

350
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,666
in the middle of the tower.   

351
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,335
they mount the crossover for the upper trio        

352
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,271
and plug in the connector that joins the three cables.   

353
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,006
that brings the correct frequencies     

354
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,209
to the three drivers.      

355
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,946
they run test tones through every completed speaker.            

356
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,016
a microphone positioned just over three feet away    

357
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,885
picks up the emitted frequencies,     

358
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,421
which a computer analyzes for accuracy.      

359
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,425
once the speaker passes inspection,        

360
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,063
they install a decorative grill over each woofer voice coil.   

361
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,970
the subwoofer tower radiates the lowest frequencies,     

362
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:15,640
with six huge drivers and a built-in amplifier.
