00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,958
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,093
         conga drums...         

5
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,033
       ...metal plating...      

6
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,806
         ...and buttons.        

7
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,321
 the conga drum may be a staple 
    of latin-american music,    

8
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,591
      but it was developed      
  from an ancient african drum  

9
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,260
    made from an animal skin    

10
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,595
         stretched over         
      a hollow tree trunk.      

11
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,330
  today, they stretch the hide  

12
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,732
           over a wood          
     or fiberglass cylinder.    

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,400
     as you're about to see,    

14
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,337
   making congas takes plenty   
       of hands-on skill.       

15
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,306
      [ conga drums play ]      

16
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,545
  these congas are made of ash, 

17
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,881
 a wood that has good acoustics.

18
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,684
           that means           
    sound resonates off of it   

19
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,887
   rather than being absorbed   
            into it.            

20
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:32,024
      first, the drum maker     
      cuts the curved slats     

21
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,960
 that will form the drum's body,
        called the shell.       

22
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,096
he traces a slat-shaped template

23
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,299
 on a rectangular piece of wood.

24
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,703
     then, using a band saw,    
  he cuts along the trace line, 

25
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:49,508
 creating a curve on the outside
      and inside surfaces.      

26
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,983
  then he moves to a bench saw, 

27
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:02,121
    a saw whose blade can be    
  adjusted to different angles. 

28
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:06,325
       he clamps the piece      
         onto a template        

29
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,927
      and angles the edge.      

30
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,241
   he flips the piece over...   

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,579
  ...and angles the other edge. 

32
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,026
     the drum maker applies     
 carpenter's glue to both edges 

33
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,030
      and clamps the slats      
      together in a circle      

34
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,033
  on a specially designed form. 

35
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,702
       the number of slats      
        per drum varies,        

36
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,839
    depending on the diameter   
          of the shell.         

37
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:58,043
    the larger the diameter,    
  the lower the conga's sound.  

38
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,046
   the glue dries in 24 hours.  

39
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,848
      it comes off the form     

40
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,252
 looking like this bongo shell, 
           but taller.          

41
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:11,790
    the drum maker now mounts   
the dried shell on a wood lathe.

42
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,060
       using a tool called      
          a wood gouge,         

43
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,729
          he shears off         
      about .2 of an inch,      

44
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:22,000
      rounding the outside      
          of the shell.         

45
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,137
      then he uses a series     
      of woodworking tools      

46
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,138
  to add decorative detailing.  

47
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,609
        once that's done,       
he smoothes the shell's surface,

48
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,413
   using three progressively    
   finer grains of sandpaper.   

49
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:40,351
 then he either leaves the wood 
 its natural color or stains it.

50
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,355
    a thick coat of oil-based   
    lacquer protects the wood   

51
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,192
 from both dryness and humidity.

52
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,765
 now for the essential hardware.

53
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,902
       first, side plates       
  made of chrome-plated steel.  

54
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:02,106
     their job is to anchor     
  the drum's animal-skin head.  

55
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,576
  they're bolted to the shell.  

56
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,781
      next, the drum maker      
      feeds a steel strip       

57
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,050
   through a bending machine.   

58
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,586
    its high-pressure rollers   
        curve the strip,        

59
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,588
     forming the drum's rim.    

60
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,426
     then he rivets v-shaped    
   steel pieces onto the rim.   

61
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,397
   elsewhere in the workshop,   

62
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,868
  they prepare the cowhide that 
  will become the drum's head.  

63
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,673
       first they soak it       

64
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,277
       in a corrosive bath      
     of cold water and lime.    

65
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,847
  this literally burns the hair 
          off the hide.         

66
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,487
    after two or three days,    

67
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:52,691
 they remove the skin and scrape
     off any stubborn hairs.    

68
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,364
      then they stretch it      
     over a circular frame,     

69
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,833
        leaving it to dry       
       at room temperature      

70
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,835
      for a couple of days.     

71
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:08,306
  after chrome-plating the rim, 

72
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,375
            it's time           
     for the final assembly.    

73
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,844
      they stretch the head     
         over the shell         

74
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,780
      and clasp it in place     
          with the rim.         

75
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,182
        they hook the v's       
       to the side plates,      

76
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:20,919
     then adjust the tension    
     to tune the instrument.    

77
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,789
  the last step is to trim off  
        the excess skin.        

78
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,260
    now the musical handiwork   
           can begin.           

79
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,882
  narrator: plating is a layer  
   of metal coating an object   

80
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,951
    made of a different type    
            of metal.           

81
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,754
 the purpose can be decorative, 
      as in silver plating,     

82
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,289
          or practical.         

83
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,557
     with industrial parts,     
          for instance,         

84
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,359
     zinc or cadmium plating    

85
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,828
  prevents the underlying metal 
          from rusting,         

86
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,265
 while nickel or chrome plating 
     protects against wear.     

87
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,241
          you can plate         
    almost any type of metal.   

88
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,776
        let's follow some       
      steel aerospace parts     

89
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,313
  as they're about to be plated 
          with cadmium          

90
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,516
          to make them          
      corrosion-resistant.      

91
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,385
      for the plating metal     
        to bond properly,       

92
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,055
 the steel surface must be free 
         of contaminants        

93
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,457
     such as oil and grease.    

94
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,459
    workers suspend the parts   

95
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,796
      over a vat of boiling     
       chemical solvents.       

96
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:41,332
    as the hot vapor comes in   
 contact with the colder metal, 

97
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,935
          it condenses,         
   dripping down into the vat   

98
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,806
   and taking any contaminants  
         along with it.         

99
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,809
      the remaining solvent     
       residues evaporate,      

100
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,614
        leaving the parts       
     squeaky-clean and dry.     

101
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,283
         next, a worker         
   wearing protective clothing  

102
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,620
      sandblasts the parts      
   with aluminum oxide powder,  

103
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,288
       a strong abrasive.       

104
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,356
  this roughens up the surface  

105
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,193
    so that the plating metal   
       will adhere better.      

106
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,368
 the most common plating metals 
     for industrial purposes    

107
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,637
  are zinc, chrome, and nickel. 

108
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,440
     think motorcycle parts     
        or sink faucets.        

109
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,043
       decorative items,        
       on the other hand,       

110
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:29,714
  are most likely to be plated  
 in tin, brass, gold, or silver.

111
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,117
      traditional tea sets,     
          for instance,         

112
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,287
 are often made of silver-plated
         copper or zinc.        

113
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,792
       the plating process      
    is called electroplating    

114
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,996
 because the key is electricity.

115
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,666
   they start by tying strands  
         of copper wire         

116
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,801
   to a copper support frame.   

117
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:55,206
    copper is the best metal    
   for conducting electricity.  

118
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,211
then they attach the steel parts
       they'll be plating.      

119
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,685
  when they hook up the support 
     to an electric current,    

120
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,354
    electricity will run from   
 the support through these wires

121
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,024
      right to the pieces.      

122
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,509
   they do the electroplating   
           in a tank.           

123
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,444
  after filling it with water,  

124
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,848
 they add a handful of chemicals
  to help conduct electricity,  

125
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,719
       because water alone      
 won't conduct it sufficiently. 

126
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,456
  along the sides of the tank,  
  in bags, are metal baskets.   

127
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,592
   they contain bars or balls   
     of the plating metal --    

128
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,728
     in this case, cadmium.     

129
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,999
   workers connect the support  
   frame with the steel parts   

130
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,002
    to the negative terminal    
    of an electric source --    

131
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,472
     the baskets of cadmium     
    to the positive terminal.   

132
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,074
      then, they switch on      
      a steady d.c. current     

133
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,944
   no stronger than six volts.  

134
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,680
    the electricity dissolves   
          the cadmium,          

135
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,749
      placing the particles     
     with a positive charge.    

136
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,818
  they travel through the water 

137
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,088
  and attach themselves to the  
  negative-charged steel parts. 

138
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,958
 this creates a smooth and even 
        layer of cadmium.       

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,195
      thin plating requires     
 just a few minutes in the tank.

140
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,032
  thick plating, several hours. 

141
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,368
  then workers rinse the parts  
  in water for about a minute   

142
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,638
to remove the chemical residues.

143
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,641
        to make the parts       
    even more rust-resistant,   

144
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,644
      workers immerse them      
    in a series of compounds.   

145
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,581
    this triggers a chemical    
    reaction in the plating,    

146
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,917
      enhancing its ability     
     to withstand corrosion.    

147
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,188
     this reaction, however,    
       changes the color.       

148
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,124
   a final rinse in hot water,  

149
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:57,595
  and this cadmium-plated steel 
aerospace part is finally ready.

150
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,397
      from start to finish,     

151
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,634
      the process has taken     
        about 90 minutes.       

152
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,871
  to plate with chrome or gold, 

153
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,140
        they have to use        
       a chemical compound      

154
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,209
  containing gold or chromium.  

155
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,945
   that's because electricity   
         can't dissolve         

156
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,147
   solid chromium well enough,  

157
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,084
and it can't dissolve solid gold
             at all.            

158
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,886
     the compound dissolves     
     in the bath like salt,     

159
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,554
       but then solidifies      

160
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,092
         once it reaches        
    the object being plated.    

161
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,894
 metal plating is very durable, 

162
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,630
        but if subjected        
   to a lot of wear and tear,   

163
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,635
   the object will eventually   
      have to be replated.      

164
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,510
narrator: have you ever wondered
        why men's buttons       

165
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,645
        are traditionally       
 on the right side of a garment 

166
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,113
    and women's on the left?    

167
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,516
          legend has it         
     that this enabled a man    

168
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,984
      to unbutton his coat      
       with his left hand       

169
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,054
      while drawing a sword     
         with his right.        

170
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,455
    wealthy women, meanwhile,   

171
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,524
        had their buttons       
      sewn on the left side     

172
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,726
        to make it easier       
  for their right-handed maids  

173
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,261
         to dress them.         

174
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,532
 one way to make plastic buttons

175
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:11,402
     uses a multilayer sheet    
      of synthetic resin --     

176
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,405
    hence the industry term,    
         sheet buttons.         

177
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,675
     workers start by mixing    
     liquid polyester resin     

178
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,744
   with a catalyst to gel it.   

179
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,546
     they pour the material     
     into a revolving drum,     

180
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,416
   which disperses it evenly.   

181
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,486
they spray a solution containing
     an ultraviolet pigment     

182
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,755
    on this first layer only.   

183
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,957
    you'll see why later on.    

184
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,893
   for this particular model,   

185
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,362
 they make grooves in the resin 
   while it's still malleable.  

186
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,499
   this will create a design.   

187
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,167
    after about five minutes,   

188
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,570
 the resin gels and they can mix
     and add a second layer     

189
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,506
      in a different color.     

190
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,509
       besides building up      
   the thickness of the sheet,  

191
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,112
         the resin flows        
 into the first layer's grooves,

192
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,649
        creating a design       
      of contrasting lines.     

193
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,853
  once this second layer gels,  

194
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,389
      they mix and pour in      
         a third color.         

195
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,325
         the drum spins         
  for another 10 to 15 minutes  

196
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,528
     until all layers cure.     

197
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,863
 a resin sheet can be comprised 

198
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:17,468
      of up to 4 different      
          color layers.         

199
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,471
         workers can now        
        remove the sheet.       

200
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,608
      it's hardened enough      
     to be cut into buttons,    

201
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,678
 but it's still flexible enough 
     not to crack when cut.     

202
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,620
      they feed each sheet      
          into a press          

203
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,156
  that's outfitted with the die 

204
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,357
       for that particular      
          button model.         

205
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,429
 the press punches out circles  
 in the diameter of the button. 

206
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,634
these circles are called blanks.

207
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,671
        here, you can see       
   the different color layers.  

208
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,443
       the blanks move on       
    to the machining center,    

209
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,313
  where they'll be transformed  
          into buttons.         

210
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,250
       automated equipment      
    loads them onto carousels   

211
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,785
   with the back of the blank   
         facing outward.        

212
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,522
    how does the loader know    
      which side is which?      

213
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,391
            remember            
    that ultraviolet solution   

214
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,794
    the workers sprayed onto    
    the first layer of resin?   

215
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,931
a u.v. detector scans each blank

216
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,867
  to make sure the first layer  
        is facing upward.       

217
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,470
    if it isn't, the machine    
       rejects the blank,       

218
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,872
   then flips and reloads it.   

219
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,546
       the carousels first      
    run the back of the blank   

220
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,749
        against a series        
        of cutting heads.       

221
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,152
 the heads are changed according
  to the model being produced.  

222
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:45,723
     for this one, the heads    
 gradually carve a curved back. 

223
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,967
the equipment then transfers the
  blank onto a second carousel, 

224
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,572
     exposing the front side    
           this time.           

225
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,973
again, a series of cutting heads

226
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,211
         gradually carve        
    the front of the button.    

227
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,185
     the shape of this model    

228
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,988
      exposes the different     
    color layers underneath,    

229
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,457
    creating a veined effect.   

230
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,898
      the last cutting head     
        drills the holes.       

231
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,341
        here, you can see       
      the full progression      

232
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,211
      from blank to button.     

233
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,214
   now they polish the buttons  
        for several hours       

234
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:48,686
  in drums containing abrasive  
   ceramic stones and pumice.   

235
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,355
  then workers flush the drums  
           with water.          

236
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,158
   the heavy polishing stones   
       sink to the bottom       

237
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,027
  while the lightweight buttons 

238
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,862
      float to the surface      
         and spill out.         

239
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,501
 the buttons then go into drums 
    that contain silicon wax    

240
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,237
          and thousands         
      of tiny wooden pegs.      

241
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,907
      while the drums spin,     
   the pegs act as a carrier,   

242
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,377
          distributing          
      an even coat of wax.      

243
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,682
 as the buttons exit the drums, 
   the pegs are screened out.   

244
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,790
    from here, plain buttons    
      are often custom-dyed     

245
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,591
    to match fabric swatches    

246
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,128
      provided by clothing      
         manufacturers.         

247
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,205
      narrator: you've seen     
      how they manufacture      

248
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,074
 some types of plastic buttons, 

249
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,678
  just a few of the many styles 
         on the market.         

250
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,347
there are several different ways

251
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,949
     to produce these handy     
        little fasteners.       

252
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,352
         so, forgive us         
      if we buttonhole you      

253
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,021
          to stay tuned         
      and watch some more.      

254
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,231
          archeologists         
   have unearthed bone buttons  

255
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,900
           dating back          
      to prehistoric times.     

256
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,704
  the ancient greeks and romans 
          used buttons          

257
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,907
     to fasten and decorate     
         their clothing.        

258
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,575
     europeans wore buttons     
     strictly for adornment     

259
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,445
     until about the 1200s.     

260
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,581
   that's when fitted garments  
        became the trend,       

261
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,318
     fastened by a long row     
   of buttons down the front.   

262
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,388
      the rich wore buttons     
     made of silver or gold,    

263
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,858
          sometimes set         
    with precious gemstones.    

264
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,663
  ordinary people wore buttons  
     made of bronze or wood.    

265
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,939
       this is another way      
     to make plastic buttons    

266
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,075
     using polyester resin.     

267
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,145
   only instead of turning it   
          into sheets,          

268
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,148
       they pour the resin      
     into long metal tubes.     

269
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,684
      here, they're mixing      
      two different colors      

270
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,253
       to create a design       
         in the plastic.        

271
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,958
   the tubes go into an oven,   

272
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,561
 where they bake at 212 degrees 
  fahrenheit for about an hour  

273
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,097
 until the liquid resin hardens.

274
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,633
    once the tubes cool off,    

275
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:19,103
  workers remove the contents.  

276
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,639
      these long resin rods     
           will become          

277
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,442
     what the industry calls    
          rod buttons.          

278
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:35,986
   the rods go into a machine   
       called the slicer.       

279
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,922
     its sharp carbide blade    
       chops the long rods      

280
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,859
    into button-sized blanks.   

281
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,733
   here's what that looks like  
         in slow motion.        

282
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,335
  it's no use showing you this  
        at regular speed.       

283
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,271
     it would be but a blur.    

284
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,742
        this machine cuts       
  up to 700 blanks per minute.  

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,412
   blanks cut from resin rods   

286
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,549
           run through          
    the same machining center   

287
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,418
 as those cut from resin sheets.

288
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
      in the last segment,      

289
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,089
   we showed you the machining  
      steps in slow motion.     

290
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,293
   here's what they look like   
        at actual speed.        

291
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,565
       any type of button       
         can be engraved        

292
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,300
  with a company name or logo.  

293
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,834
          they do this          

294
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,837
   using a computer-programmed  
         laser machine.         

295
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,308
      the laser beam burns      
 the lettering into the plastic.

296
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,980
    workers visually inspect    
      the finished buttons      

297
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,050
     to make sure that none     
          have defects.         

298
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,656
           a third way          
     to make plastic buttons    

299
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,593
       is a method called       
     thermoset compression,     

300
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,729
    a technique that combines   
     both heat and pressure     

301
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,998
   to mold the button's shape.  

302
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,002
 as we see here in slow motion, 

303
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:01,072
        the raw material        
       isn't liquid resin,      

304
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,674
   but rather melamine powder.  

305
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,476
    a pill-making machine --    

306
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,012
     the kind pharmaceutical    
        companies use --        

307
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:11,816
      compresses the powder     
    into pill-shaped blanks.    

308
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,354
  here's what that pill-making  
        action looks like       

309
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,989
        at actual speed.        

310
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,305
    to transform these pills    
          into buttons,         

311
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,242
 workers load them onto a press.

312
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,914
  the press uses high pressure  

313
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,583
       to force each pill       
       into a button mold       

314
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,118
          for a period          
      of 40 to 60 seconds,      

315
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,589
      depending on the size     
         of the button.         

316
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,191
        at the same time,       

317
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,528
        it heats the mold       
   to 325 degrees fahrenheit.   

318
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,932
     this bakes the melamine    
       into hard plastic.       

319
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,870
  they cool the molded buttons  
    in a basin of cold water.   

320
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,673
     some specialty buttons     
      will be gold-plated,      

321
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,810
     but not before soaking     
       in a chemical bath       

322
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,612
     to clean their surface     

323
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,014
       so that the plating      
         will bond well.        

324
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,484
    as a rule, only materials   
    that conduct electricity    

325
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,353
      can be metal-plated.      

326
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,155
       plastic, of course,      
        is nonconductive.       

327
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,225
    this company has managed    
         to devise a way        

328
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,160
 to gold-plate plastic buttons. 

329
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,097
           exactly how          
   is a closely guarded secret  

330
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,233
  it's not willing to divulge.  

331
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,837
    after plating the buttons   
  in copper, a 12-hour process, 

332
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,572
   they plate them in nickel,   

333
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,108
           which takes          
    just a couple of minutes,   

334
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,044
 and finally, in 24-karat gold, 

335
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,514
 which takes just a few seconds.

336
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,917
    a mere one ounce of gold    

337
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,189
       is enough to plate       
     180 pounds of buttons.     

338
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,859
  thermoset compression buttons 
     are a lower-end product    

339
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,395
  used primarily for uniforms.  

340
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,664
  sheet buttons and rod buttons 
       are higher quality,      

341
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,836
the standard choice for everyday
    and higher-end clothing.    

342
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,076
