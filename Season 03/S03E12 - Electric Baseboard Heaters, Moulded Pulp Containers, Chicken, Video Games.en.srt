00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,690
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,194
  electric baseboard heaters... 

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,199
  ...molded pulp containers...  

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,472
     ...prepared chicken...     

7
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,011
       ...and video games.      

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,321
   electric baseboard heaters   
        are inexpensive,        

9
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:01,193
easy to install, and practically
        maintenance-free.       

10
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,729
        unlike radiators,       
      they're inconspicuous     

11
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,998
        and they take up        
       very little space.       

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,670
and best of all, you can control
  the temperature room by room. 

13
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,408
       a baseboard heater       
         is simply wires        

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,478
      and a heating element     
       in a steel casing.       

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,881
      they make the element     
          using a strip         

16
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,150
     of paper-thin aluminum     
         7 inches wide.         

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,557
 it's lubricated with soap, then
 goes through a forming machine.

18
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,827
     a die punches the strip    
into little squares called fins.

19
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,030
    they measure half an inch   
  by three-quarters of an inch  

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,834
and have a circle in the middle.

21
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,738
 the machine pierces the circles
    and cuts the fins apart.    

22
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,078
     this machine churns out    
      600 fins per minute.      

23
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,250
 it stacks them on steel tubes, 
    the lengths of which vary   

24
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,352
     according to the length    
         of the heater.         

25
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,731
 as each tube fills to capacity,

26
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,634
     a worker takes it away     
         to be wired up.        

27
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,341
    elsewhere in the factory,   
  they make the heater's casing 

28
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,810
       using what's known       
      as cold rolled steel,     

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,512
    a flexible type of steel    

30
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,982
       that can be worked       
       without using heat.      

31
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,152
      after a squirt of oil     
        for lubrication,        

32
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,954
    the first die cuts holes    

33
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,490
   for attaching the baseboard  
          to the wall.          

34
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,626
 then the second die cuts holes 

35
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,594
    for attaching the heating   
     element to the casing.     

36
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,968
  now the steel travels through 
what's called the roll former --

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,237
            a machine           
     whose series of rollers    

38
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,840
        successively bend       
     a flat strip of metal,     

39
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,975
       one fold at a time,      

40
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,344
  into the shape of the casing. 

41
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,385
      from start to finish,     
    20 rollers make 20 bends.   

42
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:10,923
        the process takes       
  about 150 seconds per casing. 

43
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,132
      after the last fold,      
    a computer-controlled die   

44
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,667
         cuts the casing        
     to the required length.    

45
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,003
the higher the heater's wattage,

46
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,472
the longer the casing has to be.

47
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,209
 models range from 300 watts -- 
      about 2 feet long --      

48
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,746
       to 2,500 watts --        
       about 8 feet long.       

49
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,488
 next, they put a steel junction
 box on each end of the casing. 

50
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,223
      these hold the wires      

51
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,026
  that the electrician connects 
      to the house wiring.      

52
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,863
     workers spot-weld both     
 junction boxes simultaneously. 

53
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,640
    after a thorough washing,   
  computer-controlled sprayers  

54
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,043
        coat the casings        
        in paint powder.        

55
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,511
     then it's into an oven     

56
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:10,982
         for 20 minutes         
   at 365 degrees fahrenheit.   

57
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,921
   this transforms the powder   
 to liquid, drying it instantly.

58
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,656
    after running a red wire    

59
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,992
   for the electrical current   
   the length of the casing,    

60
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,460
    they rig up what's called   

61
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,928
     a linear high limit        
     temperature control --     

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,998
         a safety device        
     that prevents the unit     

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,801
        from overheating        
       and catching fire.       

64
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,869
           gas inside           
     the temperature control    

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,805
   expands under intense heat,  

66
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,476
      triggering the device     
       to cut the current.      

67
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,611
    now they install supports   

68
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,947
   to hold the heating element  
            in place.           

69
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,550
   they're made of satin-coat   
 steel, a rust-resistant metal. 

70
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,887
    as the element heats up,    
      it naturally expands.     

71
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,356
  to prevent it from scratching 
    against the metal casing    

72
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,891
   and making annoying noises,  

73
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,062
  they install a heat-resistant 
        plastic bushing.        

74
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,365
  now they connect the red wire 

75
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,634
         that will carry        
     the electrical current     

76
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,636
    to the heating element's    
           black wire,          

77
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,704
           capping it           
     with a wire connector.     

78
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,907
    they clip it to the cover   
     of the junction box --     

79
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,845
 easy access for the electrician
    installing the baseboard.   

80
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,782
         then they close        
     the junction box cover.    

81
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,384
        at the other end,       

82
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,053
    they connect the red wire   
       and the black wire       

83
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,855
to the temperature-control wire.

84
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,657
this runs the electrical current

85
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,593
    through the safety device   
          at all times.         

86
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,996
      after a voltage test,     

87
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:35,900
  they close it up and snap on  
  a panel to cover the element. 

88
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,339
    being toasty warm is now    
   just an installation away.   

89
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,683
     narrator: "molded pulp"    
 isn't exactly a household word.

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,086
   but it is a household item.  

91
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:57,222
     chances are, you've got    
  an egg carton in your fridge  

92
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,557
       that's made of it.       

93
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,692
           this thick,          
     cardboardlike material     

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,361
          can be shaped         
  into a variety of containers, 

95
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,029
    like those drink carriers   

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,699
          they give you         
  at the fast-food restaurants. 

97
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,374
    farms ship out their eggs   
  in trays called filler flats. 

98
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,244
        these flats begin       
      as recycled paper --      

99
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:23,982
  old phone books, newspapers,  
     magazines, cardboard --    

100
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,452
     pretty much any product    
      made of paper fibers.     

101
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,589
    the factory even recycles   
          its own flats         

102
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,625
     that had been rejected     
       by quality control.      

103
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,797
      the raw materials go      
into what's called the pulper --

104
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,867
         a giant blender        
    that mashes everything up   

105
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,268
  and blends it with hot water  

106
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,807
    that's 110 to 150 degrees   
           fahrenheit.          

107
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:53,345
the hot water swells the fibers,
  causing them to break apart.  

108
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:56,081
        after 20 minutes,       
        they become pulp,       

109
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,485
    a watery mixture roughly    
 the consistency of hot oatmeal.

110
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,887
         the pulp exits         
  out the bottom of the pulper  

111
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,223
        through a filter        
    that screens out plastics   

112
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,493
     and other contaminants.    

113
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:12,096
        shaping the flats       
  is a fully automated process. 

114
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,700
     formation molds descend    
  into a vat filled with pulp.  

115
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:19,304
         a vacuum sucks         
  the mushy mixture onto them.  

116
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,907
 water jets rinse of the excess.

117
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,243
         rotating above         
       are transfer molds.      

118
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,246
     they grab the flats off    
       the formation molds      

119
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,315
 and move them onto a conveyor. 

120
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,119
    before the transfer molds   
     grab the flats, though,    

121
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,390
         a brush applies        
    a water-based lubricant.    

122
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,259
     this ensures the flats     
    won't stick to the molds.   

123
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,895
     it's just like greasing    
          a baking pan.         

124
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,344
  the molds themselves are made 
of bronze, plastic, or aluminum,

125
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:03,682
      depending on how long     
the factory intends to use them.

126
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,818
         they're covered        
  with a stainless-steel mesh.  

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,687
this mesh ensures an even vacuum
        through the mold        

128
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,357
           so the pulp          
     spreads over it evenly.    

129
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:20,498
 the soggy flats now go into an 
 oven for 12 minutes to dry out.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,569
 the 400-degree-fahrenheit heat 
      evaporates the water.     

131
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:29,174
 this bonds the fibers together,
    forming a rigid material.   

132
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,644
    after they exit the oven,   

133
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,513
  a device appropriately called 
           an up-ender          

134
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,317
flips them up so that they stack
        into each other.        

135
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,986
  a built-in counting mechanism 
      triggers the machine      

136
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,490
   to section off the required  
 number of flats per package... 

137
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,295
   ...then compresses them...   

138
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,701
  ...and seals them in plastic  
   film to keep the dust out.   

139
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,743
        the factory uses        
    the same molding process    

140
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,212
to make four-cup drink carriers.

141
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,082
       these, too, go into      
  an oven to dry out the pulp,  

142
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,218
   but only for six minutes --  

143
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,820
          half the time         
      the filler flats need     

144
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,823
      because this product      
     is smaller and lighter.    

145
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,032
   automated compactors stack   
  the finished drink carriers.  

146
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,671
   then workers compress them   
   for packing and shipping.    

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,175
     the factory also makes     
    disposable urinal bottles   

148
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,843
         for hospitals.         

149
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,512
 they add chemicals to the pulp 

150
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,447
       to make the bottles      
          liquid-tight.         

151
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,515
           these molds          
      are three-dimensional     

152
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,785
       and lined with mesh      
         on the inside.         

153
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,788
       when they submerge       
       into the pulp vat,       

154
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,525
   a vacuum sucks in the pulp.  

155
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,660
      when they resurface,      

156
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,930
water jets rinse the excess pulp
      off the bottle necks,     

157
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,799
         and the vacuum         
      sucks out the water.      

158
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,601
     a spiked conveyor belt     

159
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,204
     transports the bottles     
       to the drying oven.      

160
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,006
 they dry at a lower temperature

161
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,208
         than the flats         
    and drink carriers do --    

162
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,410
    350-degrees fahrenheit --   

163
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,813
     and for longer time --     
          a half-hour.          

164
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,617
 this ensures the chemicals that
  make the bottles liquid-tight 

165
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,820
        cure thoroughly.        

166
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,824
 while urinal bottles can't be  
 recycled for sanitary reasons, 

167
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,960
 drink holders and filler flats 
         are recyclable,        

168
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,965
      making them extremely     
    environmentally friendly.   

169
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,777
   narrator: in the year 2001,  

170
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,514
       the average person       
    ate 61 pounds of chicken.   

171
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,651
 given that rate of consumption,

172
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,920
      if we had to process      
     the poultry ourselves,     

173
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,791
     chances are, we'd be in    
  a rather foul mood by dinner. 

174
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,994
         thank goodness         
 for chicken-processing plants. 

175
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,599
          the chickens          
      arrive at the factory     

176
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,735
     with their feet, legs,     
   and heads already cut off.   

177
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,171
   what's left are the breasts  
           and wings.           

178
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:19,110
 the slaughterhouse also removed
      the internal organs.      

179
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,815
   a conveyor belt transports   
          the chickens          

180
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,416
         to the cutting         
       and deboning zone,       

181
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:31,422
           a bustling           
    assembly-line operation.    

182
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,492
    workers prop each chicken   
     on a cone-shaped stand,    

183
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,295
        in order to have        
        both hands free.        

184
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,964
  cutting up a chicken properly 

185
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,700
          isn't as easy         
       as you might think.      

186
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,570
           the workers          
      get special training.     

187
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,106
     it's crucial they keep     
   their knives well-sharpened  

188
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,977
       and wipe them after      
   every five or so chickens.   

189
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,379
the first cuts remove the wings.

190
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,981
      starting on one side      

191
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,983
         and positioning        
     the knife horizontally,    

192
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,918
      in line with the top      
          of the cone,          

193
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
  the workers make an incision  

194
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,056
         where the wing         
       joins the shoulder,      

195
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,593
       then cuts downward,      
 across the back of the chicken,

196
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,197
        then a quick cut        
  and twist to detach the wing. 

197
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,265
     it's the same procedure    
       on the other wing.       

198
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,401
          the incisions         
   at the wing/shoulder joint   

199
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,537
       must slice through       
     the tendon completely,     

200
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,339
  otherwise, detaching the wing 
          is difficult.         

201
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,675
         and struggling         
      with a slippery wing      

202
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,211
      while holding a knife     
          in your hand          

203
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,547
 can result in a serious injury.

204
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,952
          the next cuts         
  remove the skin and breasts.  

205
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,155
     they peel off the skin,    
  then pull on the two breasts, 

206
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,759
    and make a quick incision   
        to release them.        

207
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,693
  they slice the breasts apart, 

208
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,562
  carefully checking for bones  

209
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,630
   that might have broken off   
        from the carcass        

210
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,901
and could be hiding in the meat.

211
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:53,104
          the next cuts         
      remove the tenders --     

212
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,040
            the meat            
    located under the breast.   

213
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,642
    workers make an incision    
         in the middle,         

214
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,178
    just under the wishbone,    

215
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,313
       and down the length      
         of the carcass.        

216
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,516
   this detaches the tenders,   

217
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:08,186
    enabling the next worker    
  on the line to pull them off. 

218
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,326
 meanwhile, waiting in the wings
         are the wings.         

219
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,129
workers load them onto a machine

220
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,065
      appropriately called      
       the wing-cutter --       

221
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,869
 a mini ferris wheel that takes 
  the wings for a little ride,  

222
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,871
    right into a sharp knife    

223
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,873
         that chops them        
     into three sections --     

224
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,344
  the drumette, the chubby part 
       with the most meat;      

225
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,413
  the winglet, the middle part; 

226
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,883
  and the wing tip, the pointy  
   part with barely any meat.   

227
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,485
     this factory transforms    

228
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,020
      the meatier drumettes     
        and the winglets        

229
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,425
          into frozen,          
   ready-to-eat chicken wings.  

230
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,828
         the first step         
  in that process is seasoning. 

231
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,432
     workers load the pieces    
       into a giant drum.       

232
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,503
      as the drum rotates,      
  they inject the seasoning --  

233
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,606
    barbecue or honey garlic,   
          for instance.         

234
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,448
after about an hour, the chicken
  wings come out evenly coated. 

235
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,991
now these freshly seasoned wings
    go into a gas-fired oven,   

236
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,929
where they bake at approximately
     480-degrees fahrenheit     

237
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,131
      for 8 to 11 minutes.      

238
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:32,069
   they come out fully cooked   
        and ready to eat.       

239
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,873
     they go into a freezing    
mechanism for about a half-hour,

240
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,676
 then to the automated-packaging
           department,          

241
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,879
      where they're sealed      
            in a bag.           

242
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:44,415
     these chicken pieces --    
 wings, tenders, and breasts -- 

243
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,151
    are prepared differently.   

244
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,021
  after seasoning, they travel  
     through a rotating drum    

245
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,224
       that coats them in       
a flour-and-bread-crumb mixture,

246
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,761
     then into a second drum    
       for a second coat.       

247
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:09,907
     next stop, a 40-second     
     deep fry in canola oil,    

248
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,778
        just long enough        
     to adhere the coating.     

249
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,849
    then from the frying pan    
  into the fire, as they say -- 

250
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,051
 well, into the oven, actually. 

251
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,521
    after 20 minutes at about   
     480-degrees fahrenheit,    

252
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,923
      these chicken pieces      
        are fully cooked        

253
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,793
     and ready to be frozen     
          and packaged.         

254
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,073
   narrator: they started out   
        a generation ago        

255
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,243
    as simple black-and-white   
 ping-pong games on a tv screen.

256
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,348
 today's video games are vivid, 
 sophisticated, and fast-moving,

257
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,552
   driven by state-of-the-art   
        computer software       

258
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,655
      featuring the latest      
     in high-tech graphics.     

259
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,497
     it all started in 1952     

260
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,300
   with a cambridge university  
           phd thesis           

261
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,437
 on human/computer interaction. 

262
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,440
      the student invented      
 a primitive tick-tack-toe game 

263
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,708
  on a vacuum-tube computer --  

264
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,512
  the very first computer game  
         with graphics.         

265
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,114
        a team at m.i.t.        

266
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:28,052
  designed the first recognized 
     computer game in 1962.     

267
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,187
         then, in 1972,         

268
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,458
       a stanford student       
invented the arcade game "pong,"

269
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,993
       which later became       
       a home video game        

270
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,663
         you could play         
         on your tv set.        

271
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,139
  it all begins with the people 

272
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,674
     who form what's called     
         the core team.         

273
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,211
         they brainstorm        
    in meeting after meeting    

274
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,878
  to hammer out the concept --  

275
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,282
     how the game will look,    
         how it'll work.        

276
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,218
       then they plan out       
    the production schedule,    

277
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,955
assigning who will do what when.

278
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,757
    they break down the game    
            on paper            

279
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,826
         and color-code         
         the components.        

280
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,761
       then they post them      
       on a bulletin board      

281
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,298
 that'll act as the production's
          nerve center.         

282
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,702
            now work            
 on the artistic concept begins.

283
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,506
       artists sketch out       
 the characters and backgrounds 

284
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,576
            on paper            
 in a scene-by-scene storyboard.

285
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,979
   meanwhile, graphic artists   

286
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:30,381
    recreate those storyboard   
  drawings three-dimensionally  

287
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,450
        on the computer.        

288
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:36,120
        this step enables       
      the development team      

289
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,057
        to use the latest       
in computer-animation technology

290
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,193
   to bring the game elements   
            to life.            

291
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,329
        they add colors,        
       textures, shading,       

292
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,865
    and of course, movement.    

293
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:51,802
 after developing a preliminary 
   version of each character,   

294
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,939
          the animators         
     superimpose a skeleton.    

295
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:59,143
  by manipulating the skeleton, 
  they make the character move. 

296
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,079
         they experiment        
    with different movements    

297
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,616
  until they decide which ones  
    they'll use for the game.   

298
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,762
  the animators have to design  
         every movement         

299
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:23,301
 each character can potentially 
        make in the game.       

300
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,370
      that's 700 movements      
 for this main character alone. 

301
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,172
        once that's done,       

302
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:32,577
 they flesh out the character's 
     features and costumes.     

303
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,651
 the evolution of the characters

304
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,053
  from the first pencil drawing 
      to the final version      

305
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,089
      is quite remarkable.      

306
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,860
         other animators        
    work on the backgrounds,    

307
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,062
    the game's playing field.   

308
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,064
         once they have         
    a rough version laid out,   

309
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,069
    they refine it by adding    
 details, colors, and textures. 

310
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,804
 to give it depth and dimension,

311
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,976
    they use virtual lighting   
 to create shading and shadows. 

312
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,147
   to advance the story line,   
   this particular video game   

313
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,217
 is interspersed with one-minute
        animated movies.        

314
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,819
         these segments,        
       called cinematics,       

315
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,825
 are animated in high-resolution
 to produce a top-quality image.

316
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,693
      the interactive game,     
       on the other hand,       

317
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,628
      is in low resolution      

318
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,832
 because computers can't process
 high-res images quickly enough 

319
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,968
      for fast-moving play.     

320
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,371
  the animators have to create  
     every character twice,     

321
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,375
          in both high          
       and low resolution.      

322
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,243
 meanwhile, for the cinematics, 

323
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:43,514
   they animate the storyboard  
  using rough-draft characters. 

324
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,317
         this is simply         
     to calculate the timing    

325
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,320
   and to map out a clear path  
     across the backgrounds     

326
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,356
        so the characters       
 don't collide with the scenery.

327
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,395
 to make the cinematic's action 
         look realistic,        

328
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,166
      they use a technique      
     called motion capture.     

329
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,803
          the animators         
      videotape themselves      

330
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,671
     performing the action,     

331
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:12,376
   then use animation software  
to reproduce it on the computer.

332
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,884
   computer programmers create  
 the video game's menu settings,

333
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,887
      among other features.     

334
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,357
    computer engineers design   
  the artificial intelligence,  

335
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,692
  the brain that runs the game. 

336
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,163
    it's made up of thousands   
       of computer codes.       

337
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,098
       for the cinematics,      

338
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,235
  actors record the characters' 
    lines in a sound studio.    

339
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,837
       an audio technician      

340
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,173
   mixes the voices with music  
        and sound effects       

341
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,509
   and synchronizes everything  
        with the action.        

342
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:49,980
  now they take the video game  
      out for a test-drive.     

343
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,117
     do the characters move     
  the way they're supposed to?  

344
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,319
           do they go           
   where they're supposed to?   

345
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,455
    or do they run into trees   
     and walk through walls?    

346
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,392
 this is the development team's 
           last chance          

347
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,460
  to rid the games of any bugs. 

348
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:08,799
   after that, the company can  
  finally market the video game 

349
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,335
   and hope it becomes a hit.   

350
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,210
