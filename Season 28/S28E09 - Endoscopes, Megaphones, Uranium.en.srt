00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,225
narrator: today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,661
endoscopes...          

5
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,134
megaphones...          

6
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,308
and uranium.           

7
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,722
an endoscope is a tube with optical glass fibers    

8
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:00,626
and lenses inside attached to a video camera.        

9
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,295
doctors feed the endoscope through the patient's mouth   

10
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,731
or other opening or insert it through a tiny incision     

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,269
then watch what the camera captures on a video monitor.   

12
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,308
an endoscope lets the surgeon see inside the patient      

13
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,045
during an examination or surgical procedure.      

14
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,514
its light-transmitting optical fibers work       

15
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,950
like a flashlight inside the body.         

16
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,854
the optical fiber manufacturer suspends glass rods       

17
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,155
from the top of a tall oven,   

18
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,191
which heats them to a melting temperature     

19
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:35,760
of 1,652 degrees fahrenheit.   

20
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,665
each rod drips downward in the form of a thin strand.  

21
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,237
a guide wheel turns this glass fiber in a horizontal direction.           

22
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,706
the fiber then winds on to a drum,          

23
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,808
whose rotation speed stretches it           

24
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,344
to a specific hair-thin diameter.       

25
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,250
a worker combines several single fiber spools on to a large    

26
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,521
winding wheel to make a bundle containing thousands of fibers.             

27
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,827
to make the cable that connects a light source   

28
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,196
in the operating room to the endoscope,        

29
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,698
a worker inserts an optical fiber bundle     

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,268
into a silicon cable sheathing.           

31
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,638
this one has nearly 9,000 fibers.          

32
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,376
she screws a stainless steel fastener,   

33
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:28,447
called a ferrule on to each   
threaded end of the sheathing.  

34
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,016
after saturating the ferrules and optical fibers        

35
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,553
inside with glue and curing the adhesive with heat,     

36
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,423
the worker trims off excess fibers        

37
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,092
and hands off the cable to the next station,       

38
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,461
where a work polishes both ends.              

39
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,266
polishing finalizes the dimensions     

40
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:51,103
and enables light to shine through.        

41
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,905
this quality control test, one of several,         

42
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,541
ensures the fibers can      

43
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,410
withstand a prescribed amount of pressure without cracking.  

44
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:02,014
the optical fiber manufacturer  

45
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,482
also supplies fiber spools    

46
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,751
to the endoscope manufacturer  

47
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:09,455
for the light transmission system inside the endoscope.   

48
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,823
workers cut the bundle of optical fibers        

49
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,125
to the length required      

50
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,161
for the endoscope model they're making.         

51
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,797
endoscopes vary in length and diameter,          

52
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,900
depending on the part of    
the body they're designed for.  

53
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,602
after verifying that the diameter           

54
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,170
of the bundle is correct,    

55
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,639
they tie the optical fibers with string           

56
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,975
to hold them together during insertion.        

57
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,846
then workers insert the fiber bundle         

58
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,782
between the inner and outer stainless steel sheathes     

59
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,385
that make up the main body of the endoscope,        

60
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,322
pushing the fibers down the length of the inner sheath.             

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,727
they attach a stainless steel adaptor.    

62
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,361
this will connect the light cable         

63
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,964
from the operating room light source           

64
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,432
to the endoscope,        

65
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,634
transferring light to the optical fibers      

66
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,937
inside the endoscope.      

67
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,539
a worker inspects those fibers  

68
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,508
under magnification for black spots.         

69
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,544
black spots indicate broken fibers,          

70
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:10,082
which would interrupt the transmission of light.    

71
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:14,419
an endoscope transmits an image much like a telescope does.   

72
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,689
optical lenses send reflected light, which produces the image,             

73
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,424
from inside the patient     

74
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,394
all the way up to your eye peering through the top.     

75
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:26,665
the lenses in the endoscope are glass rods.         

76
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,101
after cleaning them with chemical solution,     

77
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,969
workers line them up in a fixture           

78
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,840
with brass spacers       
of various lengths in between.  

79
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,576
depending on the length of the endoscope,        

80
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,444
there are five to seven lenses.             

81
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,915
the spacers create specific distances between them.     

82
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,951
once workers have assembled   
the image transmission system,  

83
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,588
they gently slide it off the fixture         

84
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,858
into the inner sheath of the endoscope.        

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,959
then, they screw on an ocular cap          

86
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,429
to hold it all in place.     

87
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,500
a worker cleans the cap's glass top,       

88
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,069
then attaches an eyepiece.    

89
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,371
this gives the surgeon the option of either       

90
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,107
looking directly into the endoscope        

91
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,844
or looking at an operating room video monitor          

92
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,279
which receives the image via a small camera        

93
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,249
attached to the eyepiece.    

94
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,018
this demonstration shows how it all comes together    

95
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,421
in the operating room.      

96
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:25,224
after securing the endoscope in a holding fixture,      

97
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,225
the surgeon attaches the light cable         

98
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,527
coming from the nearby light source.          

99
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,730
the light travels down and out the endoscope,      

100
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,300
illuminating the area that surgeon's working on.    

101
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,936
the lenses reflect the image   

102
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,671
to the top of the endoscope,   

103
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,341
where a camera transmits it to a video monitor      

104
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,710
that's mounted in front of the surgeon.         

105
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,825
narrator: in the beginning,   

106
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,993
megaphones were simply cone-shaped devices       

107
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,662
that focused sound forward so it went further        

108
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,000
and could be heard more clearly.          

109
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:11,703
in the 20th century microphones, an amplifier and a speaker    

110
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,205
were added to the cone,     

111
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,440
and that really ramped up the volume.      

112
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,279
with a megaphone, there's no need to shout.    

113
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,649
just speak, and you will be heard.      

114
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,352
this waterproof version is designed for coaching,    

115
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,255
law enforcement, and military uses.        

116
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,725
production starts with a panel 
of four digital circuit boards  

117
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,828
that have little gold pads on them.        

118
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,398
an assembler places a stencil over the panel     

119
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,401
and aligns the stencil holes with the gold pads.       

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,171
he then squeegee's       
solder paste down the stencil,  

121
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:50,108
and it flows on to the exposed gold pads.      

122
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,913
this is before and after the solder past application.   

123
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,516
robotic arms install electrical components      

124
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:02,520
on the solder-coated pads, creating circuitry.       

125
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,024
various reels unwind to deliver these little parts.       

126
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,593
the robotic arms suction them off liners     

127
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:12,431
and transfer them to precise locations on the boards.     

128
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:16,001
the parts will run the megaphone's sirens,     

129
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,936
horns, and microphones.     

130
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,773
a technician clamps       

131
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,609
one of the completed circuit boards in a tester.   

132
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,578
spring-loaded pins underneath make electrical contacts     

133
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,782
with the components and probe their performance.   

134
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,453
the system runs a full test of the circuitry.        

135
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,788
at the next station, an assembler attaches      

136
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,490
a part known as the front can         

137
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,927
to the end of a flared speaker cone.    

138
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,629
he then turns his attention to the speaker.         

139
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,433
the assembler inserts screws in the base.   

140
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,068
he threads wires from the speaker         

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,836
through a hole in the cone    

142
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,404
and through the front can.    

143
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,441
the assembler then places the speaker in the cone,     

144
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:00,278
and he screws it in place.    

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,916
he attaches a connector to the protruding speaker wires.             

146
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,253
the worker places a mesh metal screen       

147
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:12,090
over a hole in the rear can.   

148
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,758
the assembler taps a nut driver             

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,661
with a hammer to force the mesh into the hole,     

150
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,831
and this shapes the mesh into a microphone cover.     

151
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,639
he removes the newly-formed mic cover and fits it to the mic,  

152
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,943
manually crimping it around the sides for a snug fit.    

153
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,984
he now tucks the microphone into a tube           

154
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,087
that has a sliding inner sleeve.             

155
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,890
the assembler inserts the tube into the microphone hole     

156
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,093
in the rear can.         

157
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,061
he slides the inside tube down  

158
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:54,766
to push the microphone in the hole.           

159
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,869
he secures the knob for turning the megaphone on   

160
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,538
and for adjusting the volume.  

161
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,109
the assembler installs a mini-circuit board       

162
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,378
that's linked to the siren and horn button.         

163
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,617
these small spring pins will mate to a battery      

164
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,154
to power the megaphone's circuitry.    

165
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,656
he tucks the pins into molded protrusions     

166
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,292
inside the rear can       

167
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:25,230
and waterproofs them with rubber o-rings.       

168
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,365
this megaphone subassembly is now ready           

169
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,234
for the main circuit board.   

170
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,003
the assembler threads wires   

171
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,972
for this switch trigger, microphone, siren,        

172
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,744
and horn through holes in the board.          

173
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,080
he then screws the board to the rear housing.       

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,121
he fits a silicon o-ring around          

175
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,491
the rim of the rear can to seal it.         

176
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,159
the assembler then joins the rear can           

177
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,594
with all the working parts    

178
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,264
to the front can and cone assembly.        

179
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,800
he connects the speaker wires to the circuit board.      

180
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:07,539
this megaphone is now ready for a sound test.        

181
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,441
the technician connects it to a temporary battery      

182
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,778
and powers it up.        

183
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,147
check, one, two. one, two.            

184
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,914
check, testing, testing.             

185
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,184
one, two, test.         

186
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,087
more sensitive testing is needed.        

187
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,922
he encloses the megaphone in an insulated chamber     

188
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,393
to shut out background noises.  

189
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:31,296
a computer runs the megaphone at different frequencies     

190
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,333
and analyzes its performance.  

191
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,502
once the megaphone passes these tests,           

192
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,871
they install handles.      

193
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,008
and now it's ready for anything you have to say.    

194
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,559
narrator: uranium is a metallic element        

195
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:04,495
that was discovered by a german chemist in 1789.    

196
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,997
the significance of this discovery        

197
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,134
wasn't understood for a century and a half.    

198
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,937
in 1938, scientists figured out that uranium atoms      

199
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,307
could be split to produce energy.        

200
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,479
the size of a fireplace log,   

201
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,116
this nuclear fuel bundle generates a lot more heat.    

202
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,918
it's packed with enough uranium             

203
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,922
to power 100 homes for a year.  

204
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,791
to obtain the uranium,      

205
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,460
the tunnel 1,640 feet underground         

206
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,396
at this site in northern saskatchewan.      

207
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,432
this mine is the largest source             

208
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,835
of high-grade uranium in the world.          

209
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,971
the uranium ore lies beneath a bed          

210
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:49,273
of water-saturated sandstone.  

211
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,709
to reach it, they use drill bits studded        

212
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,012
with tungsten carbide buttons.  

213
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,613
like knuckles on a fist,     

214
00:11:55,615 --> 00:12:00,285
the button bits punch into the rock face.       

215
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,287
these first holes are for pipes              

216
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,122
that will pull heat out of the ground        

217
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,726
and freeze it around the ore.  

218
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,663
the miner operates the equipment by remote control.        

219
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,532
it transfers a new piece of pipe to the end of the drill     

220
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,967
roughly every five feet     

221
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:21,739
to penetrate 426 feet into the sandstone bed.     

222
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,208
it takes up to eight days    

223
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,677
to install just one length of pipe,       

224
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,879
and there are 200 of them.    

225
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,214
workers configure the pipes   

226
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,851
so they surround the ore deposit.         

227
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,687
these freeze pipes will stabilize the ground,    

228
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,089
and they'll also turn high-pressure ground water    

229
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,693
to ice, so it won't interfere with the actual mining.     

230
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,964
a freeze plant above ground chills          

231
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,101
calcium chloride brine     
to minus-22 degrees fahrenheit  

232
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,104
and sends it through the freeze pipes.        

233
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,607
the brine absorbs heat as it freezes the ground     

234
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,677
and loops back to be chilled again.       

235
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,981
above the uranium deposits,   

236
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,651
workers now gear up to mine the ore.         

237
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,487
they'll use this bit to chew into the ore body    

238
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,923
in order to make an initial small-diameter hole       

239
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,659
known as a pilot hole.      

240
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,597
the pilot hole maps out the drill route to ore,     

241
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:22,500
and it creates an entry point for larger mining equipment.   

242
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,202
from a raised position,     

243
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,371
the bit bores vertically into the rock          

244
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,007
to drill the pilot hole     

245
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,977
and reach a specific level below the ore body.    

246
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,086
they're now ready for the reamer bit.       

247
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,787
the reamer has numerous     

248
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,024
button-encrusted wheel tentacles.         

249
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,025
as this animation shows,     

250
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,730
the drill pulls the reamer up the pilot hole, widening it.   

251
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:54,232
and the broken ore falls into what's known        

252
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,802
as an extraction chamber.    

253
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,772
here, a tram operated by remote control        

254
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,174
scoops up the rock.       

255
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,845
this remote control system keeps miners a safe distance away   

256
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,180
from falling rock hazards.    

257
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,216
it also minimizes their exposure            

258
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:15,353
to the radioactive uranium in the ore.           

259
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,688
as another precaution,      

260
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,424
workers continuously ventilate the mine,       

261
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,727
introducing fresh air every 20 minutes.        

262
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,996
steered by the operator's joystick,     

263
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,532
the tram delivers the ore to a scanner.      

264
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,469
by measuring the amount of radioactivity in the ore,   

265
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,804
the scanner determines      

266
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,841
the uranium content is about 15%.          

267
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,344
in much of the ore, the uranium content is even greater --    

268
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,681
on average, around 18%,     

269
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,349
and that's considered to be very high-grade.      

270
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:50,888
the train now empties the ore into a chute.      

271
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,793
cameras follow the rocks' journey to the next station.   

272
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,728
then from a control room,    

273
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,830
an operator manipulates a hydraulic hammer        

274
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,199
to smash the ore to bits.    

275
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,736
the broken ore then migrates to a mill     

276
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,040
that grinds it into a fine sand.              

277
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,443
they add water, and it becomes slurry,      

278
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,779
which they then pump to the surface.         

279
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,715
trucks then transport the uranium ore slurry      

280
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:22,220
to a mill nearly 50 miles away.              

281
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,489
they pull into a special off-loading facility.      

282
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,325
the support for a vacuum system aligns with the tote       

283
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,628
that encases the slurry tank.  

284
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,867
once in position, a vacuum pipe drops into the tank       

285
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,004
and suctions up the slurry.   

286
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,874
cameras provide a live feed of the unloading progress    

287
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:47,545
to a control room almost 23 feet away.       

288
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,748
after a wash and a radiation check,      

289
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,016
the truck leaves.        

290
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,051
stay tuned for the transformation        

291
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,621
of uranium into nuclear fuel.  

292
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,871
narrator: just one fuel bundle of uranium contains       

293
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,373
the same amount of energy    

294
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,709
as just over 71,000 gallons of oil.      

295
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,912
but uranium can't simply be chipped away      

296
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,880
from the rock it resides in.   

297
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,816
it must be chemically separated and processed     

298
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,421
to make it into usable fuel for a nuclear reactor.      

299
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:37,328
acid dissolves the uranium, but not the rest of the rock.  

300
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,630
it settles to the bottom of these tanks.         

301
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:44,302
the uranium-acid solution flows forward,     

302
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,906
leaving the unwanted minerals behind.         

303
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,208
using a series of chemical reactions,      

304
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,777
they further purify the uranium.            

305
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,914
they then roast it at 1,562 degrees fahrenheit.   

306
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,852
this concentrates it into a jet-black powder.       

307
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:06,024
the uranium powder flows into 55-gallon steel drums.   

308
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,164
a worker taps the lip of the drum       

309
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,233
to remove residual powder.    

310
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,640
he then puts the lid on and activates a press     

311
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,809
that secures it tightly to the drum.       

312
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,316
as an extra precaution,     
he seals it with a steel ring.  

313
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,087
he labels it to indicate the drum's contents,       

314
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,324
weight, and radioactivity.    

315
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,795
workers stack the drums in a warehouse          

316
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:48,233
to await shipment to the next processing plant.        

317
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,069
there, the uranium goes from black to yellow       

318
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,871
as they convert it to uranium trioxide,       

319
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:58,375
an interim chemical form in the processing chain.     

320
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,778
they ship the uranium trioxide in specially      

321
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,315
designed inverted cones.     

322
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,284
upon arrival at the next facility,        

323
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,152
a valve opens at the bottom   

324
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,288
and the powder flows into conveyor tubes       

325
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,791
that take it into the plant.   

326
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,326
inside, workers dissolve     

327
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,430
the uranium trioxide powder in acid.         

328
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,000
a worker takes a sample to test the density       

329
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:25,870
and the chemistry and confirms that both are acceptable.    

330
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,209
they then add a chemical to turn the dissolved uranium  

331
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,211
back into a solid.        

332
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,014
after more processing,      

333
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:39,283
the uranium trioxide becomes uranium dioxide,     

334
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,487
the chemical form required for nuclear fuel.        

335
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:46,757
spinning the uranium dioxide mixes          

336
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,359
the different sized particles  

337
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,497
to make it a more homogenous blend.     

338
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,700
the chemical processing has also caused the uranium     

339
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,535
to change color again.      

340
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,671
it is now a fine black powder.  

341
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,607
using several tons of pressure,            

342
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,678
tools shape the uranium dioxide into pellets.          

343
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,746
a revolving wheel with protrusions         

344
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:12,383
guides the pellets into a channel conveyor.     

345
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:15,653
the conveyor takes the pellets into a furnace.   

346
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,024
over 24 hours, the heat removes pores in the pellets.  

347
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,761
the pellets shrink, increasing the density of the uranium.   

348
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:28,499
the particles fuse together and harden into a ceramic.    

349
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,669
here's a pellet before and after baking.        

350
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
a robot arm now loads the pellets           

351
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,842
on to a tray and levels them.  

352
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,247
a conveyor moves the tray forward.        

353
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:48,519
ahead, another robot places zirconium fuel tubes on a rack.              

354
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,022
zirconium is a metal that's highly resistant     

355
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,324
to both heat and corrosion,   

356
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,860
but neutrons will pass freely through it        

357
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,662
during the fission reaction.   

358
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,298
the rack of tubes meet up    

359
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,035
with a tray of incoming pellets.            

360
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,737
a robotic loader pushes the stack            

361
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,072
of 30 pellets into the tube.   

362
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,711
another robot delivers the rods one at a time      

363
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,848
to an automated welder that caps the ends.       

364
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,222
the next robot retrieves the completed uranium fuel rods              

365
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,058
and transfers it to an assembly fixture.     

366
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,030
it arranges a total of 37 rods  

367
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,633
in an upright position within the fixture.       

368
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,575
after the rods have been welded         

369
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,543
and the bundle capped at both ends,          

370
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,114
a robot transfers it to a scale.             

371
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,049
this weigh-in confirms      

372
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,819
that there is the correct amount of uranium in the bundle.    

373
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,957
prior to burn up in a reactor,  

374
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,461
the amount of radioactivity emitted by nuclear fuel bundles             

375
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,662
is very low, and they're safe to handle    

376
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,266
as workers prepare them for shipping.          

377
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,635
they're now on their way to the power plant,       

378
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,405
where they'll be sure to generate a reaction.
