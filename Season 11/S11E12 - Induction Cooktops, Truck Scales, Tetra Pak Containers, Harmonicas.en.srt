1
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,585
narrator: mankind has always cooked food,

2
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,121
using everything from campfires and barbecues  

3
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,256
to gas and electric stove tops.

4
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,992
now he can use an induction cooktop.     

5
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,529
it doesn't need a fire, a flame,
or a red-hot burner.      

6
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,932
it uses innovative cooking technology       

7
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,334
our ancestors never dreamt possible     

8
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,136
and would swear was pure magic.

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,610
an induction cooktop doesn't use
traditional cooking elements  

10
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,213
above or below the cooking surface.      

11
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,281
it uses copper induction coils 

12
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,885
that generate high-frequency electromagnetic fields.    

13
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,621
these fields          
excite the molecules in the pan,

14
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,157
creating heat only in the cookware itself.  

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,026
that's why the yolk remains cold

16
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:36,962
and only what touches the pan cooks.             

17
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,965
the magic starts with a punching press     

18
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,834
that stamps computer-generated shapes   

19
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,404
into sheets of cold-rolled steel.     

20
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,241
these cutouts fix the position 

21
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:53,111
of the induction coils that sit
under the glass surface.    

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,448
a press break bends the four sides of the steel  

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,551
so it will hold a glass-ceramic top in place. 

24
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,324
in the meantime, a machine spray-paints the burner box,  

25
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,593
the visible part of the cooktop.

26
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,232
a technician affixes the labels

27
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,667
and the power cord onto a housing box       

28
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,238
that will conceal the induction
electronics and coils.     

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,740
she secures the power cord for strain relief.       

30
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,413
she then attaches the power-cord ground     

31
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,350
and a system ground wire to the housing box.      

32
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,589
she places a cover on the box and screws it into place.   

33
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:43,094
another technician puts together
the induction electronics.   

34
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,231
these assemblies        
of circuit boards, cooling fans,

35
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,368
and semiconductors drive the cooktop.       

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,237
she covers the electronics with insulation        

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,705
and a metal carrier plate   

38
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,175
that will support the induction coils.      

39
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,777
then she feeds the user-interface wires    

40
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,979
through the top of the coil-carrier plate.   

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,516
the technician screws the carrier plate    

42
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,586
and the electronic assemblies together,           

43
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,455
then grounds the electronics. 

44
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,591
protective tape around the openings      

45
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,860
will prevent the user-interface wires    

46
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,462
from rubbing against the coil-carrier plate.

47
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,902
and some insulation will protect
the electronic assemblies.   

48
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,041
she closes that side of the electronic housing box 

49
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,910
and attaches all the power cables.     

50
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,217
a sheet of insulation goes on the flip side of the box,  

51
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,554
where she mounts the      
electromagnetic-coil assemblies.

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,556
the iron slugs on the back of each coil pod  

53
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,425
help distribute the electromagnetic energy   

54
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,961
to the cookware evenly.    

55
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,636
she connects the coil assembly to the system board.      

56
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,905
then she places the remaining four coil assemblies      

57
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,373
onto the carrier plate     

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,177
and connects their leads to the system board.      

59
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,319
meanwhile, another technician assembles the components    

60
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,922
of a glass touch-user-interface panel.  

61
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,464
she connects the interface to the steel holder      

62
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,600
that was bent into shape at the start          

63
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,536
and is now attached to the black burner box.    

64
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,218
she covers the cooking surface and control panel       

65
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,820
with an attractive stainless-steel frame,     

66
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,324
then connects the system board to the control panel.     

67
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,162
she closes up the other side of the burner box.       

68
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,834
then she bolts everything down to complete the cooktop.    

69
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,905
a technician tests the unit.  

70
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:14,179
using a metal object to activate
the electromagnetic field,   

71
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,849
he verifies that the controls respond properly.       

72
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,052
he makes sure all five induction coils are working  

73
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,323
and the power output from each coil is correct.   

74
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,095
the control panel confirms it's a success.    

75
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,066
clean, safe, and energy-efficient,     

76
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,904
induction cooktops make cooking food quick and easy.  

77
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,617
narrator: at a highway weigh station,  

78
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,554
inspectors weigh each transport
truck on a road-level scale  

79
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,222
to calculate taxes on the goods it's hauling   

80
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:01,493
and to make sure the load doesn't exceed safety limits. 

81
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:05,096
you also find truck scales at grain silos, quarries,    

82
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,566
and other sites that move bulk products.    

83
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,505
the key to this enormous scale 

84
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,774
is the tiny component called a strain gauge,     

85
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,311
which sends signals to the scale's computer    

86
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,079
when compressed.        

87
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,183
they make the strain gauge from a laminate        

88
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,186
by bonding paper-thin sheets of nickel-iron foil,      

89
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,589
epoxy, and teflon in a press. 

90
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,327
then they coat the laminate in a light-sensitive chemical 

91
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,863
and apply a plastic film    

92
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,066
with an image of strain gauges in negative format.      

93
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,602
then they expose the setup to ultraviolet light.     

94
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,805
the light-sensitive chemical reacts,            

95
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,875
imprinting the images into the laminate's metal surface. 

96
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,278
now they have rows of strain gauges.        

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,014
an inspector examines every gauge          

98
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,450
and marks any flaws to be discarded.        

99
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,620
now a technician measures how much voltage        

100
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,422
flows through each gauge.   

101
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,025
if it's too low, she raises it 

102
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,829
by rubbing off a microscopic amount of surface metal.    

103
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,165
when the strain gauges are finished, they cut them apart 

104
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,502
and send them to the load cell department.  

105
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:21,039
there, workers delicately tape four strain gauges       

106
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,643
into each stainless-steel load cell.           

107
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,779
then they solder electrical wiring to each one. 

108
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,382
the wires all run to a circuit board       

109
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,183
at one end of the load cell.  

110
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,784
and from the load cell,    

111
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,755
wiring runs to the scale's computer readout.       

112
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,259
the smallest amount of moisture or dirt      

113
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,761
would cause a strain gauge to malfunction,        

114
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,264
so they weld a cup over each one

115
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,934
to hermetically seal it within the load cell.     

116
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,870
every finished load cell    

117
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,139
undergoes a quality-control check    

118
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,274
to verify that it works properly.    

119
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,277
the testing machine applies weight in increments  

120
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,280
until it hits the maximum weight
the cell can bear --      

121
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:07,052
34,000 kilograms, or 75,000 pounds.       

122
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,890
the truck-scale structure   

123
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,892
in which they'll install the load cells         

124
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,760
is called the weighbridge.   

125
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,162
they begin assembling it upside down,          

126
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,832
with a surface made of steel plates.     

127
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,234
to build the base of the weighbridge,      

128
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,439
they lay out a grid of thick steel tubes and crossbeams.   

129
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,776
workers lower a guide to help them align the parts perfectly.

130
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,248
beneath each load cell is a pin.

131
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,183
in order to weigh accurately, 

132
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,519
a load cell has to be level,  

133
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,922
so it's critical to make sure this pin is level       

134
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,291
before welding on the bulkhead that holds it.         

135
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,330
once fully welded,       

136
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:56,134
the weighbridge is assembled and ready for painting.    

137
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,605
the paint equipment laces the powdered paint    

138
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,741
with a positive electrical charge       

139
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,143
and the weighbridge with a negative one.      

140
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,545
this evenly draws the paint particles      

141
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,814
onto the steel like a magnet. 

142
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,750
in another department, they assemble the steel stand 

143
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,487
on which the load cell will sit.

144
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,956
a welder tacks the pieces together,      

145
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,158
then a robot does the full welding.     

146
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,900
now that all parts are ready, 

147
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,003
final assembly of the truck scale can begin. 

148
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,308
the weighbridge, right-side up now,       

149
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,444
contains eight load cells at different locations.    

150
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,181
the first step is to install each load-cell stand      

151
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,783
into its respective position. 

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,323
they insert a link on each side of the stand.   

153
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,394
they position the load cell at the top of the links...   

154
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,800
...and the bulkhead pin at the bottom.         

155
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,644
then they close up the location
with an access plate.     

156
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,818
the last step is to calibrate the scale.   

157
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,888
they lay a 10,000-pound weight on different parts of the scale

158
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,359
to check if the digital readout
is accurate.          

159
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,966
it takes a lot of time     
to get a truck scale just right,

160
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,402
but it's definitely worth the "wait." [weight]

narrator: tetra pak containers      

162
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,852
keep drinks and food products 
safe to consume for up to a year

163
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,455
without refrigeration or the use
of additional preservatives.  

164
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,191
made mostly from paper, they're recyclable       

165
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,795
into things like egg cartons, paper towels, and toilet paper.

166
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,396
a tetra pak container     

167
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,034
is packaging built with nature and freshness in mind.     

168
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,805
tetra pak containers      
hold all sorts of food products,

169
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,741
from smoothies to fine wines. 

170
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,080
the package gives products a long shelf life       

171
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,551
because of its special layers --

172
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:31,689
the plastic layer, the paperboard, and the foil. 

173
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,326
a plastic coating makes the package leakproof.  

174
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,830
tetra pak containers      

175
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,000
are made entirely from recyclable materials.   

176
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,837
the first step to making them is printing.          

177
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,706
a worker selects the appropriate printing plates

178
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,041
for a given customer      

179
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,712
and applies them to the cylinder
of the printing press.     

180
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:59,650
the press transfers one color at
a time to the paperboard layer 

181
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,853
using solvent-free ink.    

182
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,990
a tetra pak container can have up to six colors.   

183
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:09,561
at full speed, it takes only minutes to print.

184
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,898
a strobe light visually stops the motion,   

185
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,168
helping the pressman check the quality of the printing.  

186
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,616
a worker feeds the printed paperboard     

187
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,084
into a lamination machine   

188
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,287
that will join it with the plastic and foil layers.  

189
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,831
at the same time,       

190
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,834
a worker loads a roll of micro-thin aluminum foil  

191
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,302
into the laminator.      

192
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,375
a gas flame heat-treats the paperboard         

193
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,111
to ensure adhesion to the plastic layer.     

194
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,714
the laminator extrudes liquefied plastic       

195
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:06,317
between the roll of aluminum and the heated paperboard.   

196
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,320
rollers squeeze all the layers together.    

197
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:21,733
the printed paperboard, with all
its protective layers applied, 

198
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,202
then comes off the back end of the laminator        

199
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,504
in a large master roll.    

200
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,945
the operator threads it into a cutting machine     

201
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,813
called a slitter.       

202
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:41,119
it cuts and winds the printed material onto individual rolls.

203
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:47,025
the slitter's knives cut the material into four lanes, 

204
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,894
each of which becomes a smaller roll.        

205
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,642
the operator trims the excess material from each roll.    

206
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,778
then a conveyor system sends the rolls for shipping  

207
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,515
to a packer to be filled with their product.      

208
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,922
at the packer's plant,     

209
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,858
an operator loads the roll of flat packages        

210
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,362
into a filling machine built and installed by tetra pak.   

211
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,401
tension rollers guide the material       

212
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,171
into the filling machine where it is sterilized.     

213
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,481
the machine then forms and seals the material     

214
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,118
into one continuous tube.   

215
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,423
and a little further down,   

216
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,793
the machine fills the tube with product.         

217
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,903
it then cuts the tube into individually sealed packages...

218
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,306
and drops them into a chute for folding.   

219
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,014
it ejects the finished packages
onto a conveyor belt.     

220
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:25,656
finally, it sends the packages on their way to the customer.  

221
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,593
lightweight, compact, and recyclable,        

222
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,595
tetra pak containers are eco-friendly,       

223
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,032
and that's certainly something to celebrate          

224
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,134
over a glass of fine wine.   

225
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,748
narrator: there are two main types of harmonicas.   

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,950
a diatonic harmonica has 10 mouth holes.       

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,621
it plays a 7-note major scale in a single key of music.   

228
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,357
a chromatic harmonica has up to 16 holes,      

229
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,893
plus a special slide mechanism to produce extra notes     

230
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,463
so it can play in any key.   

231
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,235
[ harmonica plays melody ]   

232
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,309
as air goes through a harmonica,
so does saliva,        

233
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,778
which is why they make the inner structure      

234
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,514
from a type of wood that doesn't expand or smell  

235
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,716
with repeated exposure to moisture.          

236
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,652
making a standard chromatic harmonica      

237
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,654
begins with a block of pearwood

238
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,058
measuring about 5 1/2 by 1 1/4 inches.  

239
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,626
they run it against a cutter  

240
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,661
that carves a row of air chambers front and back.

241
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,765
this produces the component known as the comb.       

242
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,936
a press stamps slots in a millimeter-thick brass plate 

243
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,404
that will hold the reeds.   

244
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,607
the plate will eventually go on top of the comb,      

245
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,877
its slots aligning with the comb's air chambers. 

246
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,213
another machine cuts reeds   

247
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,883
from brass-based metal specially
formulated by this company   

248
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,486
to produce quality sound and be corrosion-resistant.  

249
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,755
working one size at a time,  

250
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,959
they cut a batch of a few hundred reeds.    

251
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:11,629
they test a reed from each batch
with a tuning machine,     

252
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,899
plucking it to see if it produces the correct pitch.  

253
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:19,971
the size and profile of a reed 
determines the note it produces.

254
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,641
the longer it is, the lower the note, and vice versa.   

255
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,979
now they rivet the reeds to the reed plate --      

256
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,780
one reed for each note.    

257
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,051
consecutive reeds go on opposite sides of the plate.

258
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,718
with this configuration,    

259
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,722
blowing into the harmonica vibrates one reed,       

260
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,825
while drawing air out vibrates the other.      

261
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,596
they flatten each rivet on one side of the plate.   

262
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,065
this fastens the reed securely at the bottom,         

263
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,067
leaving the rest free to vibrate.          

264
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,937
if necessary, they file the reed down    

265
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:56,274
so the slot doesn't obstruct its movement.

[ humming ]          

267
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,749
now a tuning specialist gets to work.         

268
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,553
she plays each reed on the plate
and compares the tone     

269
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,489
to a perfectly tuned set of reeds for reference.     

270
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,826
if the pitch is off, she adjusts
it with a bit of filing.

[ high-pitched humming ]    

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,500
once the reed plate is in tune,
it goes on top of the comb,  

273
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,670
the reeds and slots aligning with the comb's air chambers. 

274
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,440
workers attach the parts    

275
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,177
with steel nails that have a brass plating   

276
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,912
to prevent corrosion.     

277

now for the two-piece cover  

278
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,384
that encloses these internal components.   

279
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,454
for standard models, the factory
uses stainless steel,     

280
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,722
starting with a sheet     

281
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,391
that's less than a half a millimeter thick.   

282
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:51,929
fancier harmonicas have silver- or gold-plated covers. 

283
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,736
the sheet goes through a press that has a series of dies.   

284
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,072
they progressively stamp out the cover pieces,       

285
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,008
first embossing the artwork,  

286
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,044
then cutting the size, then forming the shape.    

287
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,485
workers sandwich the comb between the two cover pieces, 

288
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,955
then attach everything with either brass-plated nails 

289
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:21,291
or brass- or nickel-plated screws.            

290
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,828
chromatic harmonicas have   
a mouthpiece over the blowholes.

291
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,665
it's usually made of chrome-plated brass     

292
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,101
that they curve slightly in a press.          

293
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:34,104
the mouthpiece shields the lips
from a slide mechanism inside. 

294
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,707
that mechanism has three parts --       

295
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,511
a slide with a button positioned
in between two plates.     

296
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:49,320
they screw the mouthpiece   
onto the front of the harmonica.
