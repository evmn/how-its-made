captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:55,921
narrator: thinning shears are scissors   

4
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,723
with at least one comb-like blade.       

5
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,325
when the blades come together,  

6
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,727
some hair falls between the teeth of the comb,      

7
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,195
and that hair is cut       

8
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,665
while other strands are left intact.         

9
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,132
a few quick snips,        

10
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,802
and this handy tool can do a lot for your style.         

11
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,143
it's often necessary to go many lengths        

12
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,011
to achieve the right look.    

13
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,347
stylists use thinning shears to layer a cut from the inside.             

14
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,018
this removes bulk to give hair height.       

15
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,220
when it comes to improving your hairdo,    

16
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,090
thinning shears definitely have the teeth for the job.      

17
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:34,760
they start with stainless-steel rods.    

18
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,897
the rods ride a magnetized conveyor      

19
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,699
up to an induction heater.    

20
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,768
it heats each rod from the ends              

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,906
until it becomes white-hot and soft.       

22
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:51,110
the rod is now ready for forging.           

23
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:56,115
a worker moves the hot rod back and forth over a die    

24
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,250
as a hammer slams into it.    

25
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,456
this flattens and forms it    

26
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,058
into the shape of two scissor blades.      

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,861
the forging leaves a lot of excess steel around the blades.             

28
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,998
they cut away that excess.    

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,266
reheated now,          

30
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:19,605
a worker plunges the blades into a lead bath.        

31
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:24,210
then he dips them in oil, standing back as they flame up.               

32
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,746
the lead bath and the quick cooldown      

33
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,013
harden the steel.        

34
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,217
another worker then clamps a blade into position.      

35
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,819
a cutting wheel rolls into action        

36
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,755
and carves a comb profile into the blade.         

37
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,693
a constant flow of water-based coolant      

38
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,094
keeps the temperature      

39
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,562
of the cutting wheel and the scissor part down,    

40
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,230
otherwise the cutting process  

41
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,832
could cause them both to overheat           

42
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:51,537
and compromise their strength and integrity.  

43
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:57,176
this is the thinning scissor blade before cutting,      

44
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,145
and this is the blade with its new teeth.       

45
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,182
at the next workstation,     

46
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,718
a robot transfers a blade    

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,786
to an automated grinding machine.        

48
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,724
the machine grinds both the front and sides of the teeth              

49
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:15,127
to smooth the rough edges.    

50
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,395
this robotic system processes  

51
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,199
up to 150 scissor blades an hour.             

52
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,876
next, it's into a tumbler    
filled with synthetic pebbles.  

53
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,145
as the thinning blades bounce around,          

54
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,548
friction happens.        

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,016
this smoothes more rough edges,             

56
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,218
especially the handles and finger rings         

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,021
that didn't undergo grinding at the robot station.      

58
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,557
after about four hours,     

59
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,560
a magnetic conveyor retrieves them.         

60
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,294
then the midsection,       

61
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,563
where the two blades are to be joined,        

62
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,766
receives hands-on attention as a worker smoothes it     

63
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,436
using a fine abrasive sanding belt.      

64
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,706
they move on          
to the straight scissor blade.  

65
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,176
an employee hones it against a horizontal grinding wheel.   

66
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:07,747
this aligns the cutting edge.  

67
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,385
he inserts the threaded screws in holes             

68
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,920
in a straight-edged blade    

69
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,191
and in the corresponding comb-like blade.         

70
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:23,996
he brings the two together    

71
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:28,133
and then tightens the screws to a specific torque.      

72
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,868
too tight or too loose,     

73
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,405
and these thinning shears won't operate smoothly.     

74
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,276
with an emery board, he gently files the shears    

75
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,046
to get ride of lingering dust from the extensive grinding.   

76
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,285
he now tests their function.   

77
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,287
it isn't entirely smooth,    

78
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,957
so hammers a section      
of the comb blade to level it.  

79
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,764
it now moves more freely against the straight blade.   

80
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:02,101
and now the ultimate test --   

81
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,836
he tries them out on a lock of artificial hair,  

82
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,372
and he confirms that these thinning shears    

83
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,108
are as sharp as they look.    

84
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,312
next, the blade comes up against a spinning leather belt.     

85
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,648
this takes it from merely sharp to razor-sharp.         

86
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,052
it also polishes the blade to a mirror finish.       

87
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:25,391
a computerized laser       

88
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,595
burns the brand name and model information into the shears.   

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,069
they screw a brass nub to the finger ring        

90
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:41,140
to give the pinkie finger something to rest against.    

91
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:44,743
these thinning shears are now ready for shipment.   

92
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,581
soon, they'll be in the thick  
of things at the beauty salon.  

93
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,631
narrator: wooden wagon wheels  

94
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,166
roll through the tumbleweeds of another time.         

95
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,768
fixed to covered wagons,     

96
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,704
they transported settlers to the american west       

97
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,107
in the 18th and 19th centuries.           

98
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,909
there are now cities and freeways           

99
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,111
where wagon wheels once blazed trails,       

100
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,181
but making them is not a lost art.        

101
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,719
a thriving nostalgia industry  

102
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,855
keeps these big wooden wheels turning.             

103
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,125
wagon wheels are in demand for historical re-enactment events,             

104
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,794
museums, and the movies.     

105
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,796
the wheelwright carves the hub  

106
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,932
from a chunk of strong, rot-resistant oak.        

107
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,135
as it spins on a lathe, he cuts it to length.      

108
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,537
he stops the lathe        

109
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,674
and marks measurements     
for the wagon wheel's profile,  

110
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:52,143
sizing it for reinforcing metal hoops.   

111
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,278
he resumes carving,       

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,814
using the penciled lines as a guide.           

113
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:59,952
he transforms the oak blank into a barrel-shaped design,   

114
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:04,056
which is traditional for    
wagon wheel hubs of the 1870s.  

115
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,760
with the hub now clamped in another machine,       

116
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,164
he uses a mechanized chisel to punch out regular spoke holes              

117
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,233
known as mortises.        

118
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,038
he angles the edge of each hole              

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,640
to receive the tenon end of the spoke.          

120
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,446
he slides steel hoops onto the hub           

121
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,849
at the ends and in the center.  

122
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:35,120
it's a snug fit, but it's not quite tight enough.             

123
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:39,124
a hydraulic press squeezes the hoops around the hub     

124
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,794
to provide just the right tension.     

125
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,462
the hoops will act as a constricting force     

126
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,398
to keep the wood from splitting.           

127
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,467
from a chunk of wood       

128
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,737
into a substantial wagon wheel hub.         

129
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,074
now using tools called spokeshaves,       

130
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,342
the wheelwright shapes the hickory wood spokes.     

131
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:02,213
he narrows the throat of the spoke to add flexibility,          

132
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:06,618
where it is to be inserted into the hub.          

133
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,757
he coats the mortises of the hub with glue.      

134
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
he inserts the spokes into the glued holes.      

135
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:19,298
he drives them into place with a sledgehammer.       

136
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,502
there are 12 spokes in total for this front wagon wheel.   

137
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,171
the wheelwright then spins the wheel       

138
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,906
and eyeballs it to confirm    

139
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,109
that the spokes rotate on an even plane.        

140
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:35,848
then like sharpening a pencil, 
he brings the ends to a point.  

141
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,517
this prepares them for the tenon cutter       

142
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,585
that now carves them into peg shapes         

143
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,521
for insertion into the wheel rim.       

144
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,858
he installs the steam-bent wooden rim in two sections.   

145
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,194
it's drilled to match up with the spokes.   

146
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,466
at first, it's easy, but as the tension builds,    

147
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,736
it becomes tougher to insert the remaining spokes,      

148
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,872
so he stretches the rim wider with a clamp.          

149
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,407
this gives him more room to maneuver      

150
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,943
as he fits the others into the rim half.        

151
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,678
in the process,         

152
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,348
he creates a slight bow in the plane of the wheel.    

153
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,149
it's a truss-like state     

154
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,618
that adds strength to the wagon wheel.       

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,755
now using an electric roller machine,   

156
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,659
he bends a strip of steel    
into a round wagon-wheel tire.  

157
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,165
it takes just one pass through the rollers       

158
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:30,168
to achieve the desired bend.   

159
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,205
the length will need to be precisely measured.       

160
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,309
he measures the inner circumference     

161
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,912
with an old wheelwright tool called a traveler,        

162
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:44,249
to determine just how much tweaking it needs.   

163
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,585
then using a torch,       

164
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,787
he cuts the tire to the exact length required.  

165
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,058
he makes the tire slightly smaller than the wheel itself  

166
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,793
because it must serve as a heavy-duty elastic band   

167
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,464
to hold the assembled wagon wheel together.      

168
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,201
he welds it where the ends meet,              

169
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:06,338
and this completes the wagon-wheel tire.      

170
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,875
he now bakes the tire briefly in an open fire.         

171
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,610
the metal expands and at a strategic moment,    

172
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,147
they pull it out of the flames.             

173
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,015
the tire has stretched to the point           

174
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,017
where it can be installed on the wheel,          

175
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,618
but it's not quite hot enough  

176
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,088
to cause the wooden wheel to catch fire.          

177
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,823
they pour water onto the tire  

178
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,359
to bring it back to a cooler temperature.     

179
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,629
as it cools,          
it shrinks to the wagon wheel,  

180
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,833
creating that elastic band effect.    

181
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,836
next, they prime and paint a matching set of wheels     

182
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,273
in the color of the client's choice.     

183
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,176
and with those finishing touches,     

184
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,313
these wagon wheels are en route to the past.    

185
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,584
for fans of american history,  

186
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,220
it's sure to be a sentimental journey.      

187
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,941
narrator: for people who need to grab   

188
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,676
a quick bite for breakfast,   

189
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,146
the invention of the toaster pastry in the 1960s              

190
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,615
was the greatest thing since sliced bread.       

191
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,483
finally, the toaster could be used    

192
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,152
for more than toasting bread,  

193
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:31,323
and the toaster pastry was definitely a sweet alternative.          

194
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,963
the toaster pastry retains   
its sweetness during toasting.  

195
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,633
the syrupy filling and frosting don't melt out          

196
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,034
and into the toaster.      

197
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,303
it's all because of the ingredients        

198
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,406
and how they come together.   

199
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,242
at this factory,         

200
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,110
they start by making an organic pastry.        

201
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,312
the blender operator       

202
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,647
loads dry ingredients, like rice bran,         

203
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,982
into the blender,        

204
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,118
followed by a sugar syrup and molasses.          

205
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,855
it's the molasses that gives the pastry a brownish color.   

206
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:08,860
he adds organic palm shortening and organic granulated sugar.  

207
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:12,197
the flour and water are piped into the blender barrel.     

208
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,532
spiraling mixers blend and knead the dough       

209
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,670
to the desired consistency.   

210
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,872
next, it's into a hopper     

211
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,009
that feeds the dough between two rollers.       

212
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,345
they squeeze and flatten the dough      

213
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:30,214
into a sheet that's about 8/10 of an inch thick.      

214
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,552
a conveyor moves the toaster-pastry dough forward             

215
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:36,821
to sets of larger rollers.    

216
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,158
they apply serious pressure to roll the dough much thinner.            

217
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,695
wheels at the sides fold back the dough       

218
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,497
as the width expands.      

219
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,965
a dusting of flour to the rollers          

220
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,634
keeps things from getting too sticky.           

221
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,038
coming off the final rollers,  

222
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,308
the thickness of the dough has been reduced to 2/10 of a inch.              

223
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,511
at another station,       

224
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,581
they whipped up a batch of cherry pomegranate jam.    

225
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,382
the jam is hearty and thick,   

226
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,985
so it won't run as nozzles pump the jam     

227
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,655
onto the rolled pastry sheet.  

228
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:15,059
each toaster pastry receives three strings of jam.      

229
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:18,529
this depositor system fills 10 tarts at a time.    

230
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,199
it works out to 390 tarts a minute.      

231
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:26,604
a second sheet of dough heads towards the jam-filled one.   

232
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,674
en route, a spiked roller punches holes  

233
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,210
for venting steam during baking.             

234
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,746
without these holes, the pressure would build     

235
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,282
and the toaster pastries would explode.          

236
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,286
the top sheet of pastry now merges with the bottom one.              

237
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:44,690
the conveyor belts move it exactly the same speed,     

238
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,692
so the top pastry lands in perfect alignment       

239
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,294
on the jam-filled one.      

240
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,230
a cylinder with a brass grid pattern    

241
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,965
bears down on the pastry     

242
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,235
to compress it between the jam fillings.    

243
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,505
this forms pockets of jam.    

244
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,041
a cylindrical blade slices the pastry        

245
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,912
into individual tarts.      

246
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:11,783
a device pulls off the side trimmings.       

247
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,055
the toaster pastries       

248
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,657
travel through a 150-foot-long convection oven              

249
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,795
heated to 300 degrees fahrenheit.     

250
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,865
the operator keeps a close watch for leaking jam.         

251
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,065
that would be a sign       

252
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,402
of bad seals in the pastry pockets.      

253
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,137
he rejects any with leaks.    

254
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,672
he also keeps an eye on the color           

255
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,340
as the pastries brown.      

256
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,678
they shouldn't be too dark or too light.          

257
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,350
fresh out of the mixer,     

258
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,019
the pink frosting now flows onto a revolving belt      

259
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,555
that spreads it onto the toaster pastries    

260
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,057
at just the right thickness.   

261
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,095
they've added a bit of starch to the icing,          

262
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,565
and it's this starch that allows the icing to harden and set   

263
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,835
so it won't melt and drip into the toaster during toasting.   

264
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,176
they sprinkle granulated colored sugar     

265
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,378
onto the toaster pastries.    

266
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,114
they call this topping the crunchlets.         

267
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:20,251
the crunchlets add both flavor and texture to the pastry.    

268
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,788
once cooled, the toaster pastries transfer  

269
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,324
from one conveyor to another.  

270
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,793
a breaker roller snaps them at the crimp line        

271
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,729
to separate them into groups of two.       

272
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:37,068
the completed tarts head towards the packaging line.              

273

an operator does a visual inspection as they pass by.   

274
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,408
mechanical arms push the tarts into aluminum wrapping.     

275
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,145
hot rollers seal and cut the wrap at the ends.      

276
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,550
this wrapping preserves the tarts for eight months,   

277
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:54,152
no preservatives needed.     

278
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,754
suctioning arms grab and open cartons      

279
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,391
to accept the foil-wrapped toaster pastries.        

280
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,494
it takes about an hour      

281
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,631
to manufacture a box of toaster pastries,    

282

00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,884
and horse hair.         

294
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,354
to make the wooden part, called the stick,        

295
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,223
the bow maker lays a template  

296
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,026
onto a .4 to .5-inch-thick block of pernambuco          

297
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:11,196
and marks where he'll make his cuts.       

298
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,101
he follows his markings with a band saw,         

299
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,305
cutting out the stick's basic shape.     

300
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:29,847
then he planes the stick, thinning it out,         

301
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,249
tapering it to narrow toward the front,   

302
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,317
and angling the corners     

303
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,754
to make the square contour octagonal.            

304
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,793
next, he repeatedly heats the stick with a gas flame    

305
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,062
to soften it           

306
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,331
and gently bends it against his knee.        

307
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,734
then, afterward, against a wooden form      

308
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,204
to give the stick a very precise curve.      

309
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,610
this is referred to as the camber of the bow.    

310
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,279
next, using a handsaw and template,          

311
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,416
he cuts out a piece of pernambuco      

312
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,751
for the bow's front tip, called the head.         

313
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,954
he refines the shape, first with a rasp,        

314
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,025
then with a file, then with sandpaper.       

315
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:18,163
then he glues on a bone plate to protect the head from damage.             

316
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,900
he wraps string tightly around it        

317
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,704
to apply continual pressure   
while the glue sets overnight.  

318
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,106
the next day, he files down the sides     

319
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,309
to make the plate flush with the wood.          

320
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,578
using a traditional drill,    

321
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,650
he bores a hole about 4/10 of an inch deep into the head  

322
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,452
and chisels the hole into a trapezoid shape.     

323
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,987
this forms the hair block    

324
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,723
into which he'll later insert the hair.         

325
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,260
next, he measures and marks a block of ebony wood      

326
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,596
to begin making the bow's frog,              

327
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,864
the piece at the bottom     

328
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,132
by which the musician holds the bow          

329
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,469
and adjusts the tension of the hair.           

330
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,937
he shapes the block using first a saw,        

331
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,406
then a chisel,          

332
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:05,877
and rasps, files, and sands all the surfaces smooth.     

333
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,147
the frog has a space on top called the mortis,        

334
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,083
into which he'll later insert the hair.         

335
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,420
the bow maker glues a decorative mother-of-pearl accent      

336
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,755
onto the side,          

337
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,424
then cuts two small plugs out of maple wood.        

338
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,427
these will anchor the hair at each end of the bow.     

339
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:26,164
he inserts one into the frog's mortis...    

340
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:33,104
...and the other into the hair block in the head.   

341
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,909
a bow this size requires a tenth of an ounce of hair.   

342
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:42,113
that's approximately 180 horse hairs.         

343
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,915
the bow maker bonds them at one end      

344
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,319
with some melted rosin, a sticky plant resin,      

345
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:52,190
then inserts this end into the frog      

346
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,392
and anchors it with a plug.   

347
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,265
then he bends the hairs     

348
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,736
and slides on a nickel-silver ring called a ferrule      

349
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:07,539
to hold them together.      

350
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,808
more expensive bows often have a gold ferrule.    

351
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,078
to mount the frog,        

352
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
he inserts a long metal screw with an adjuster head      

353
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,949
into a hole drilled into the back of the bow.    

354
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,620
the screw operates an eyelet connected to the frog.      

355
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,423
now he combs the hair straight.            

356
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,493
the individual hairs must be parallel to each other      

357
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,495
for the bow to perform properly.            

358
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:34,833
he ties the loose ends together with thread       

359
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,567
and bonds them with rosin.    

360
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,973
then he inserts the sealed end into the tip           

361
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,209
and anchors it with that second plug.      

362
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,317
back to the frog now,      

363
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,120
he moves the ferrule out of position,         

364
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,522
seals the mortis with a mother-of-pearl slide,     

365
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,991
then puts the ferrule back.   

366
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:03,327
he wraps the parts of the stick the musician holds        

367
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,062
in silver or gold wire and leather           

368
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,065
to protect the wood from wear  

369
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,267
and brands the maker's name.   

370
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,803
turning the adjuster at the back              

371
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:14,472
moves the frog forward and backward       

372
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,741
to alter the tension of the hair.           

373
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,543
the violinist tightens the hair before playing          

374
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,913
and loosens it when putting the instrument away.
