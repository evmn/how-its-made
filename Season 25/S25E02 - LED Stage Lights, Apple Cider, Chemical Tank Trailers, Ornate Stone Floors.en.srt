narrator: today, on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,994
l.e.d. stage lights...      

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,866
...apple cider...        

6
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:39,805
...chemical tank trailers...   

7
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,379
...and ornate stone floors.   

8
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,654
in the world of stage lighting,            

9
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,991
traditional incandescent or halogen bulb spotlights    

10
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,660
are making way for l.e.d.s.   

11
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,929
l.e.d.s are light-emitting diodes      

12
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,631
controlled by electronics.    

13
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,267
they use less energy, emit less heat,         

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,269
and can produce a wide array of colors            

15
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:13,739
without the use of filters.   

16
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,209
incandescent or halogen stage  
lights produce just one color.  

17
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,279
the only way to create more is to shine the light beam              

18
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,281
through colored plastic called gel filters.       

19
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,284
however, this l.e.d. stage light              

20
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:27,886
uses seven different colored l.e.d.s,         

21
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:31,757
which can be blended into a variety of different hues.   

22
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,696
this computer-guided machine places all the components    

23
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,497
on the stage light's circuit board,          

24
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,835
which contains 60 l.e.d.s in 7 different base colors.   

25
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,179
another machine measures     

26
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,282
and cuts pieces of insulated electrical wire.  

27
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,389
then, the machine strips the insulation off the ends   

28
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,491
and crimps on terminals.     

29
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,430
the machine processes up    
to 26 feet of wire per second.  

30
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,736
workers manually assemble 10 wires and two connectors   

31
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,805
into a control harness.     

32
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,074
the harness will connect the light's control board    

33
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,076
to the l.e.d. array.       

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,680
on the factory floor,      

35
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:31,483
they paint the stage light's two-part cast-aluminum housing.            

36
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,619
the paint process is electrostatic.        

37
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,756
this means the housing and the black powder paint    

38
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,893
are laced with opposing electrical charges.       

39
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,029
this spreads the paint evenly over the housing.     

40
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,965
then, the housing goes through an oven,      

41
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,600
which bakes on the paint.    

42
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,438
back in the assembly area,    

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,041
workers install the stage    
light's electronic components,  

44
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:59,111
starting with the lcd screen.  

45
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,447
it displays the current settings and modes            

46
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:05,785
and the menus for changing them.              

47
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:09,321
after covering the screen with a protective plastic shield,   

48
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,990
they install the control panel.             

49
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,327
it has an opening for the screen.         

50
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,265
this plastic cover protects the lcd.        

51
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,001
it also directs outside air   

52
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,136
into the housing to the light's cooling fan,   

53
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,908
which they now secure in place with this bracket.        

54
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,478
the fan dissipates the heat the l.e.d.s generate.      

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,082
this block of aluminum, called the heat sink, absorbs  

56
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:41,020
and quickly dissipates some of that heat.        

57
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,421
they mount the l.e.d. array   

58
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,690
on top of this twofold cooling system.     

59
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,094
then, they install the optic assembly.            

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,033
this plastic component focuses the individual l.e.d.s.            

61
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,169
they construct         
the stage light's mixing tube,  

62
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,370
lining its interior       

63
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,708
with adhesive-backed aluminum mirrors.        

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,110
the mirrors mix the seven l.e.d. colors     

65
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,912
into a single color.       

66
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,119
the assemblers now join the two halves of the mixing tube,    

67
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,989
adding a glass lens on the front.          

68
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,790
the lens focuses the light    

69
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,228
produced by the 60 l.e.d.s into a single beam.       

70
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,099
then, they install the tube over the optic.         

71
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,537
next, they mount the control card   

72
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,274
to the side of the mixing tube.              

73
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:39,678
the control card is the stage light's onboard computer.            

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,481
it processes the commands the lighting technician enters.             

75
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,750
commands can be entered from the control panel      

76
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,822
or remotely from a computer.   

77
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,158
after installing the main power supply,      

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,494
they plug a dmx cable into the control card.      

79
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,965
dmx is the digital network    

80
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,901
through which the console or computer           

81
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,638
communicates to the stage light.             

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,774
they join this completed unit to the rest of the housing,   

83
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,877
which has the dmx and power connectors.      

84
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,649
this stage light is now finished            

85
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,784
and ready for a thorough quality control check.      

86
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,987
they plug it into a testing machine,     

87
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,191
which powers it up and verifies several functions.           

88
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,593
the machine also calibrates every color      

89
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:34,132
to ensure consistency in every stage light they manufacture.  

90
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,535
then, they run the stage light at full power          

91
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,470
for three hours nonstop     

92
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:43,342
to simulate strenuous operating conditions.      

93
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,344
once the light passes these tests,       

94
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,781
it's ready for its stage debut.             

95
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:07,566
narrator: apple cider is also known  a 

96
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,702
it's darker and cloudier than conventional apple juice  

97
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,840
because tiny bits of apple are not filtered out.      

98
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,374
these flavorful fragments    

99
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,144
are what makes this fall beverage unique.    

100
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,518
when the apples on the trees are ripe,      

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,121
it's time to produce apple cider.     

102
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,925
they process the apples within days of the harvest    

103
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:38,663
to produce a beverage that tastes both fresh and sweet.   

104
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,200
it starts with the right mix of apples.            

105
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,801
some varieties are sweet,    

106
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,536
and others are tart.       

107
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,607
this mix of flavors will spice things up.      

108
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,677
the apples float to the surface of a water-filled pit      

109
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,278
and drift onto a conveyor    

110
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,514
that takes them into the cider mill.       

111
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,354
inside the mill, the apples spill into a washing station.  

112
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,395
water sprays the apples as they              
bounce across rolling brushes.  

113
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,601
next, the apples take a trip up to a grinder.   

114
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:22,707
inside, a steel arm pushes the apples against a grater.   

115
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,112
it shreds them, pits and all, into a pulp.      

116
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,481
this pulp is known as pomace.  

117
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:36,054
the pomace lands in a funnel.  

118
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,458
from here, a pump moves it through pipes across the plant,             

119
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,861
where it arrives at a press.   

120
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,864
the apple pomace        
flows between two porous belts  

121
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:49,401
that wind around rollers.    

122
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,804
the rollers apply pressure to squeeze out the juice.    

123
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,475
the juice drips through holes in the belts.          

124
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,012
the process strains out most of the pulp,      

125
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,348
but some remains as the juice spills from the press      

126
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,451
into large catch pans.      

127
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,690
then, they pump this chunky apple liquid  

128
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,192
into a holding tank.       

129
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,164
from the tank, it        
flows through a revolving drum  

130
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,902
that filters out more pulp, pits, and apple stems.      

131
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,305
the fluid seeps through the perforations in the drum   

132
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:31,443
and flows into a large trough.  

133
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,044
after one more screening,    

134
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,448
only fine bits of apple and sediment remain.  

135
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,653
this gives it the desired cider consistency and flavor.  

136
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,655
the cider now flows into channels       

137
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,992
between hot steel plates.    

138
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,327
the heat destroys pathogens and bacteria           

139
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,532
that would convert       
the natural sugars to alcohol.  

140
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,468
this ensures that the cider is both safe to drink      

141
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,337
and nonalcoholic.        

142
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,874
it's now ready for bottling.   

143
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:08,012
a worker slides plastic jugs into position under nozzles.   

144
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,016
the nozzles descend and pump the boiling-hot apple cider   

145
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,485
into the jugs.          

146
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,556
they're filled to the brim so air can't get inside.     

147
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:22,293
air causes the cider to deteriorate.         

148
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,628
next, the conveyor        

149
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,298
moves the jugs forward to a capping station.  

150
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:33,172
plastic caps funnel toward the jugs as they approach.    

151
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:40,578
the caps land on the rims with perfect timing.       

152
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,183
spinning wheels tighten the caps as the jugs ride by,       

153
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,384
hermetically sealing the hot apple cider,       

154
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,655
giving it a shelf life of approximately a year.     

155
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,926
the jugs then head into a tunnel,     

156
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,728
where sprayers douse them with cold water.   

157
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:05,671
next, machinery pulls the liner             
off of adhesive-backed labels.  

158
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,606
an electric eye detects the approaching jugs,  

159
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,876
queuing rollers to apply the labels.       

160
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,679
the filtered-out pomace     

161
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,216
from earlier is cooked four to five hours.       

162
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,420
this caramelizes the sugars in the apples,          

163
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,357
turning the pomace into a highly concentrated spread   

164
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,392
known as apple butter.      

165
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,699
they bottle it while it's piping hot to preserve it.    

166
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,434
although not technically butter,             

167
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,705
this fruit spread has a similar consistency.    

168
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,510
it takes a full day of processing          

169
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,280
to produce both apple butter and apple cider.         

170
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,450
it's time to raise a glass    

171
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:56,288
and enjoy the sweet bounty of the harvest.         

172
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:16,208
narrator: chemical tank trailers roll down our highways 

173
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,811
they haul liquid chemicals for 
manufacturing and other needs.  

174
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:25,284
chemicals could be hazardous if               
released into the environment.  

175
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,587
making a chemical tank trailer is serious business.       

176
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,560
chemical tank trailers are built              

177
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:40,699
to ensure that a potentially harmful cargo arrives safely.  

178
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,101
their design is tightly regulated       

179
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,205
because safety is in everyone's best interest.            

180
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,109
they build the chemical tank from scratch.          

181
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:56,248
they start with a big sheet   
of heavy-duty stainless steel.  

182
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,584
pressurized rollers curl it into a cylinder         

183
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:03,054
that will become half of the tank's inner vessel.   

184
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:07,325
using a crane, they transfer the 20-foot-long rounded section             

185
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,760
to a welding station.      

186
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,332
here, an operator controls a semi-automatic welder     

187
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,667
with a joystick.         

188
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,604
the welder joins the two sides of the sheet           

189
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,406
to complete the cylinder.    

190
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,544
they bring two cylinders together             

191
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:28,813
to form a 40-foot-long inner vessel.   

192
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,083
this seam is near the midpoint.            

193
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,418
it will be subject to significant bending stress  

194
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,353
in transport.          

195
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,290
it's critical that this weld is perfect.    

196
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:44,762
the team caps the end with metal discs known as heads.             

197
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,399
they tack-weld the heads to the vessel first       

198
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,035
and assure that the fit is exact.      

199
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:56,608
then, a semi-automatic welder does a permanent weld.      

200
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,449
next, they weld three long half pipes along the bottom,   

201
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:10,055
again doing tack welds first and then final welds.      

202
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,457
the three pipes serve as a heating panel,    

203
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,728
keeping the chemical cargo at a liquid state.        

204
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,065
this is important because, when some chemicals solidify,  

205
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:24,268
their purity is compromised.   

206
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,805
the team slides the first of many metal rings       

207
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:32,678
onto the tank and clamps each ring to the shell.     

208
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,480
these rings stiffen the structure and act  

209
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,883
as an exterior skeleton.     

210
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,219
a worker does the initial tack welds.     

211
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,959
then, a semi-automatic welder makes the full welds.      

212
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,267
after attaching a steel framework to the bottom,     

213
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,905
a crane transfers the inner vessel to the trailer.      

214
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,507
a worker tucks insulation between the vessel        

215
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,976
and the trailer.         

216
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,978
he secures the tank to the trailer          

217
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,182
with intermittent welds known as stitch welds.      

218
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,119
another member of the team    

219
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:19,191
wraps strips of rigid foam around the steel vessel.     

220
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,392
he spaces the foam evenly apart              

221
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:26,131
and pulls them tightly against the vessel with metal strapping.           

222
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,634
this creates compartments for fiberglass insulation.    

223
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,007
he tucks the insulation into the spaces,         

224
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,275
blanketing the vessels      

225
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,479
so the chemical freight will stay warm and fluid.    

226
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,619
the team now builds the outer shell.     

227
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,887
they pull stainless steel sheets             

228
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,159
around the inner vessel using thick nylon ties.     

229
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,027
these sheets are made of thinner steel         

230
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,830
than the kind used       
to construct the inner vessel.  

231
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,566
they easily conform to the cylindrical shape.    

232
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,971
a worker welds the sheets in place,            

233
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,907
completing the outer shell.   

234
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,045
once a manhole         
has been installed at the top,  

235
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,782
the crew builds a metal platform around it.            

236
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,852
this platform allows a person to access the manhole      

237
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:24,055
without slipping or denting the outer shell of the tank.   

238
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,594
a worker attaches a ladder to the tank.      

239
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,531
it will be used for accessing the manhole.    

240
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,201
another member of the team    

241
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,272
connects l.e.d. taillights and inserts them in light boxes              

242
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,040
at the back of the trailer.   

243
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:50,048
he secures the lights to the light box with screws.  

244
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:58,490
it takes about five days to   
build a chemical tank trailer.  

245
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,159
they last for 30 years or more,              

246
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,463
so this trailer should be good for the long haul.        

247
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,982
narrator: centuries-old churches and palaces           

248
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,651
have ornate stone floors     

249
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,853
that took craftsmen decades to create            

250
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:33,124
with chisels and other hand tools.      

251
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,327
today, factories can produce similar elaborate designs    

252
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,232
in a matter of hours thanks to computer-guided machinery.  

253
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,838
these floor designs are so intricate,        

254
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,207
it's hard to believe that each component       

255
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,409
is an individually cut piece of marble,         

256
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,412
granite, or other natural stone.     

257
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,948
whether the design covers an entire floor,     

258
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,217
or it's a single decorative insert,        

259
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:03,021
the starting point is a stone slab.         

260
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,757
it's massive but extremely thin,       

261
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,160
so it's actually quite fragile.            

262
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,095
workers use a pneumatic suction hoist    

263
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:15,967
to position the slab onto a cutting machine table.  

264
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:20,305
the machine is entirely computer-guided.   

265
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,842
it cuts with a jet of water.   

266
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,243
the water contains particles of garnet,            

267
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,313
an extremely hard gemstone.   

268
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,983
the jet cuts by eroding the stone       

269
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:35,053
rather than by sheer force, which would crack it.      

270
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,725
workers rinse away the stone grit and abrasive residue    

271
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,661
once the cutting is finished.  

272
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:48,633
they use suction cups to remove the cut pieces one at a time.  

273
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,272
they've cut squares for this design.         

274
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,574
some will go into the floor as-is,      

275
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,477
while others go onto a smaller water jet machine,   

276
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,347
which cuts them into intricate shapes.      

277
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,488
workers extract these smaller pieces       

278
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,692
with tweezers.          

279
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,494
every component of the design has a number.   

280
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:22,100
workers label the back of the corresponding piece accordingly.          

281
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,303
then, they print out a life-size           
version of the numbered design  

282
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,073
on a sheet of durable polyester film.    

283
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,813
they tape it to the assembly table to serve as a template.  

284
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,453
then, they lay one piece at a time front side       

285
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,388
down onto the template.     

286
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:59,738
like a puzzle, the design slowly reveals itself.      

287
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,014
once the design is fully laid out,        

288
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,416
they tack the pieces together with glue.       

289
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,786
this keeps them from shifting or separating.   

290
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,599
they lay fiberglass mesh over the entire assembly.    

291
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,642
then, they prepare an epoxy resin   

292
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,212
specially formulated for stone setting...       

293
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,084
...and spread it evenly over the mesh.          

294
00:19:55,862 --> 00:20:00,198
they let it set overnight.    

295
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
and the next day, they sand it flat.        

296
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,008
the cut stone design is now bonded together in a solid unit.              

297
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,878
now, they can safely flip it face-up.           

298
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,653
the final step is to fill the joints with epoxy grout   

299
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:33,131
then wash off any excess with a wet sponge.        

300
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:43,641
this ornate cut-stone floor insert is finally finished.   

301
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,979
this is just one of several components      

302
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,381
of a large, elaborate design.  

303
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,985
workers assemble them together 
to do a quality control check.  

304
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:56,054
then, they take the design apart              

305
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:59,857
and package each component separately for shipping.     

306
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,993
stone must always ship upright on its side           

307
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,264
because it can crack      
when transported horizontally.  

308
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,201
however, the cut-stone floor   

309
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,136
will be sturdy enough to walk on            

310
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,405
once it's properly installed.  

311
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,808
just be careful not to bump into anything    

312
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,578
while you're admiring the art beneath your feet.
