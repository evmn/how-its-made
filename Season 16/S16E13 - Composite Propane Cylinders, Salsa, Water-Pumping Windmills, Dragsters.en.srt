narrator: a composite propane cylinder  

4
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:55,654
is an alternative you'll appreciate       

5
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,790
if you've ever lugged a steel propane cylinder    

6
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,325
for your gas barbecue     

7
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,794
or if you've ever run out of gas
in mid-grill          

8
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,195
because you couldn't tell   

9
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,697
how much propane was left in the tank.     

10
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,534
composite material is 30% lighter than steel   

11
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,803
and see-through.        

12
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:15,341
composite propane cylinders are
made of transparent fiberglass 

13
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,610
encased within a plastic housing.   

14
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,745
propane, a liquid under pressure,    

15
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,281
expands as temperature increases.   

16
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,950
so as a safety feature, the cylinder valve is equipped 

17
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,086
with an overfill-prevention device,  

18
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,754
a valve shut-off that kicks in 

19
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,223
when you've filled 80% of the cylinder.      

20
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,893
this ensures ample room for the propane to expand.   

21
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,628
fiberglass is actual glass   

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,298
that's been drawn into thin fibers,       

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,401
then woven into fabric or, in this case, yarn.    

24
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,104
it's the ideal material for a gas cylinder       

25
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,441
because it's strong, lightweight, rust-proof,    

26
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:49,976
and nonflammable.       

27
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,246
a robot simultaneously winds 12 strands of fiberglass yarn 

28
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,717
over a steel form shaped like a half cylinder.  

29
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,320
the winding pattern is very  
specific, strategically designed

30
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,423
to make the cylinder walls as strong as possible.     

31
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:12,064
while winding, the robot applies
a powder binding solution.   

32
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,867
this immobilizes the strands  
so that the shape won't collapse

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,304
when the robot later lifts it off the form.  

34
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,275
the winding process takes about 45 seconds     

35
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,078
and produces what's called a preform.    

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,882
the robot transfers the preform
over to the next machine,   

37
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,818
a molding press.        

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,287
it injects liquid plastic at high pressure,       

39
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,490
impregnating the fiberglass.  

40
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:42,495
then it heats the preform for 10 minutes to cure the plastic.

41
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,430
what comes out of the molding press      

42
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,400
is a fully formed fiberglass half cylinder.   

43
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,808
the top-half cylinder needs to be prepped for the valve.  

44
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:02,047
first, an automated drill bores a hole.         

45
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,851
then workers apply caulking around a valve fitting...   

46
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,788
set the fitting on an assembly fixture...   

47
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,723
position the hole over it...  

48
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,395
...then press the fitting into the fiberglass.      

49
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,871
now they mount the top- and bottom-half cylinders   

50
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,673
on opposing lathes.      

51
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,143
a computer-guided grinding wheel
with a fine diamond-grid surface

52
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,878
trims the edge of each half cylinder     

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,481
to an exact specification.   

54
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:39,285
then it machines a precise 3-degree taper on each edge  

55
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,020
at opposing angles.      

56
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,630
next, an automated nozzle   

57
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,300
applies adhesive onto the tapered edges.    

58
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:00,973
then the lathes move toward each other, mating the halves. 

59
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,909
the tapered edges slot together
in a tight fit.        

60
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,246
after the adhesive cures nearly two hours later,     

61
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,715
this is a solid, inseparable cylinder,     

62
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,318
which, as per the certification 
label, conforms to the standards

63
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,122
required by government regulators.   

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,728
every single cylinder this factory produces     

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,264
undergoes safety tests.    

66
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,732
this one, in a pressurized chamber,   

67
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,270
ensures the cylinder can hold 
the required amount of pressure.

68
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:40,546
this submersion test ensures the cylinder is gas-tight.   

69
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:44,083
if bubbles appear in the water,
it means there's a leak.    

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,290
after a cylinder passes testing,
workers install the valve,   

71
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,860
which is already connected to the overfill-prevention device.

72
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,035
the valving machine holds the cylinder steady,   

73
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,437
while it turns the valve to the precise tightness    

74
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,407
the engineering specifications require.            

75
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,312
now it's just a matter of snapping together      

76
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,115
the cylinder's two-part plastic housing.   

77
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,918
the housing has handles for carrying the cylinder.   

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,057
it also has a flat base to allow
the cylinder to stand upright. 

79
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,198
composite propane cylinders come in various sizes     

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,734
to fuel everything       
from barbecues to patio heaters,

81
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:40,039
even ride-on lawn mowers and factory forklifts.     

82
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,754
narrator: salsa is a staple       

83
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,690
of mexican and southwestern cuisine --  

84
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,760
a spicy tomato-based condiment people typically enjoy     

85
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,764
as a topping on tacos or dip for tortilla chips.   

86
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,834
recipes vary, as does the kick factor --   

87
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,670
from mild to extra-hot.    

88
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,510
"salsa" is the spanish word for "sauce."          

89
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,313
this american company     
produces nine different flavors,

90
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:26,518
from regular to roasted garlic to pineapple-mango.      

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
all flavors begin       

92
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,889
with fresh tomatoes delivered daily to the factory.

93
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,526
workers inspect them carefully and remove any stems, leaves,  

94
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,729
and unripe or imperfect tomatoes.           

95
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,666
other workers, meanwhile, cut the stems off cilantro,  

96
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:45,804
a leafy herb that acts as a major flavor-enhancer.  

97
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:49,007
they wash the cilantro in a tank of ice-cold water,  

98
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,543
then transfer it to another cold-water tank   

99
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:55,614
for a second wash, and then to another tank for a third wash, 

100
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,549
then a fourth and final wash, 

101
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:01,086
this one in a machine with food-safe vegetable sanitizer, 

102
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,089
containing bacteria-killing hydrogen peroxide.       

103
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,693
then they dry the wet cilantro in a giant salad spinner.   

104
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,967
in another area, they prep the onions,     

105
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:18,170
peeling the skin and slicing off the ends.   

106
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,174
they rinse the onions with water           

107
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,311
and the same sanitizer they used on the cilantro.   

108
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,316
ditto with the tomatoes.    

109
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,053
this industrial-strength dicing machine         

110
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,588
chops up all the produce ingredients.  

111
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,160
it has interchangeable blades to
adjust for different-sized cuts.

112
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,965
first through the dicer -- the tomatoes.         

113
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,670
they enter whole        

114
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,007
and exit in pieces about 4/10 of an inch big.   

115
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,682
next, the onions.       

116
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:09,288
the dicer chops them into pieces
roughly 2/10 of an inch in size.

117
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,358
meanwhile, the cilantro goes into a cutter       

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,526
which chops it into fine pieces.

119
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,372
the recipe proportions are roughly 80% tomatoes,   

120
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:32,244
5% onions, 2% cilantro, 5% green peppers,       

121
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:34,846
then additional flavor-specific ingredients,  

122
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,983
plus salt, pepper, and vinegar.

123
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,451
with the prep work done,    

124
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:43,388
it's now time to blend all the ingredients in a giant mixer.  

125
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,291
each batch begins with 55 gallons of tomatoes.  

126
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,331
next comes the cilantro.    

127
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,799
this and all the ingredients are pre-weighed,        

128
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,668
so as to be in the correct proportion   

129
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,971
to the quantity of tomatoes.  

130
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,480
the onions are next.      

131
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,950
this particular batch of salsa is garlic-artichoke flavor;  

132
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,887
hence the next ingredient -- diced artichokes.       

133
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,624
now the combined liquid ingredients --     

134
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:24,496
lemon juice, lime juice, and white vinegar...      

135
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,498
followed by the combined dry ingredients --

136
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,702
salt, pepper, dried celery, and garlic powder.       

137
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,971
a final high-speed five-minute mix        

138
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:37,076
ensures everything is thoroughly
blended and ready for packaging.

139
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,980
the finished salsa goes into vats.        

140
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,648
from there, at packaging time, 

141
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,785
a pumping system moves it to the automated filling machine, 

142
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,521
whose nozzles squirt the required quantity of salsa 

143
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,590
into plastic containers.    

144
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,128
the machine then seals each container         

145
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,566
with a plastic safety film and presses on a cover.    

146
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,336
this is what the packaging process     

147
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,071
looks like in slow motion.   

148
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:10,008
it actually moves at about twice this speed.   

149
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,043
the filled containers     

150
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,414
now pass through a combination x-ray/metal detector.     

151
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,815
on the off chance       

152
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,885
a foreign object fell into the salsa during production,  

153
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,086
the machine flags the affected container     

154
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,689
and triggers an automated arm 

155
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,924
to eject it from the production line.   

156
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,697
this standard food-safety precaution ensures 

157
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,300
that every single container proceeding to labeling     

158
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:39,171
and then onto store shelves is "a-olé."          

159
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,126
narrator: to pump water from the ground, 
the windmill reaches to the sky.

160
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,595
the blades catch the breeze and spin,           

161
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,065
while gears convert the spinning
action into pumping action.  

162
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,335
this technology has been around
for over 2,000 years.     

163
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,004
the first known water-pumping windmills    

164
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:16,608
originated in persia around 7 a.d.         

165
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,546
in 19th-century america, this was the wheel of progress --  

166
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,080
a metal-bladed windmill    

167
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,284
that turned with greater force than traditional wooden ones,  

168
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,419
even in low wind conditions.  

169
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,422
its superior pumping capacity made it indispensable     

170
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,959
to pioneers settling inland, away from rivers and streams. 

171
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,895
and today this same design   

172
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,564
continues to be a part of the rural landscape,    

173
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,035
especially when there's no electricity to run water pumps.

174
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,376
production begins with a 100-ton punch press.  

175
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,711
once activated,        

176
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,248
it cuts triangular shapes from galvanized steel sheets, 

177
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,449
each with a slot in the center.

178
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,985
each cutout will be a windmill sail.    

179
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,789
they'll need 18 for each wind wheel.      

180
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,124
once stacked,         

181
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,328
they transfer the sail shapes to a rolling station.     

182
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,734
the roller curls the steel to an exact curvature,     

183
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,802
producing a slightly bowed shape,    

184
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,505
which will efficiently capture the wind.           

185
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:27,612
next, a worker wraps a metal rib
around each sail.       

186
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,483
he taps the sides until it fits
snugly to the sail.      

187
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,818
the rib has a tab       

188
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,286
that slots into the hole in the sail's center,     

189
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,889
allowing the two parts to interlock.         

190
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,228
bands fit through the ribs   

191
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,365
to assemble the sails in groups of three.      

192
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,769
next, a worker slides a metal loop over the guide wheel   

193
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,638
and drives the ends into holes in the gearbox,   

194
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,041
using a sledgehammer.     

195
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,310
he rivets the ends to the gearbox         

196
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,780
so that they're solidly ensconced.   

197
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,720
next, he inserts the wind-wheel hub and shaft  

198
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,390
into the mainframe of the gearbox.        

199
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,594
he taps it to nudge it tightly into place.

200
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,863
he then grinds the brake lever 

201
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,665
to shape it to the brake mechanism on the hub.

202
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,334
this braking system is critical.          

203
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,270
it will stop the wind wheel from spinning out of control  

204
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,473
in high winds.         

205
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,676
he spins the hub and activates the brake several times    

206
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,079
to confirm that his machining is dead-on 

207
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,682
and that the brake system works perfectly.        

208
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:40,552
if it doesn't, he makes adjustments.     

209
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,422
next, using a very toothy circular cutter,        

210
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,826
he carves grooves into steel blanks to shape the gears.   

211
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:53,098
the difference is quite obvious.

212
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,370
he installs a set of these gears
at the base of the metal loop 

213
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,772
and secures them with a metal pin.       

214
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,907
he checks their turning radius 

215
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,111
and then mates a larger set of gears to the smaller ones, 

216
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,716
ensuring that the teeth intermesh.   

217
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,717
this very substantial gear system          

218
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,887
will drive the guide wheel, creating the pumping action.  

219
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,459
two metal parts, called pitman arms,      

220
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,928
link the gears to the guide wheel.      

221
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,465
a steel pin holds everything together.   

222
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:30,268
as the gears turn, the guide  
wheel rolls up and down the loop

223
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,204
to complete a pumping cycle.  

224
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:38,744
next, he screws a series of thin metal rods to the hub. 

225
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:43,014
they're called wheel arms, and they hold the windmill sails.  

226
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,416
the wheel arms fit into precut holes     

227
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,619
in the structure of the sail sections.     

228
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,088
he secures the assembly with nuts.           

229
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,157
once all the sail sections have
been mounted to the wheel arms,

230
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,894
the windmill is ready for a spin.      

231
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,428
it's a test run to confirm   

232
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,465
the wind wheel and gears function flawlessly.      

233
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,036
it takes a crane        

234
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:09,074
to lift the 640-pound windmill to the top of its tower.    

235
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,245
once it's in position,     

236
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,648
a worker guides the gearbox onto the mast pipe.      

237
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,054
once it's secure, they hoist the helmet.     

238
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,723
it's a cone-shaped metal cap  

239
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,526
that will protect the gears from the elements.       

240
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:30,061
he bolts it to the top of the gearbox.   

241
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,135
with that job done, this windmill is ready to pump.

242
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,205
it should last decades,    

243
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,742
providing water that is as free as the wind.  

244
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,626
narrator: dragsters roar out of the starting line      

245
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,496
in a cloud of smoke, and then it's a blur.     

246
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:08,032
traveling at speeds of up to 320 miles an hour,  

247
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,635
these hot rods rip through a quarter-mile racetrack    

248
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,437
in less than 4 seconds.    

249
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,039
it's why they need parachutes to slow down          

250
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,476
and come in for a safe landing.

251
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,382
blink a couple of times, and the race is over.     

252
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,851
packing an incredible 8,000 horsepower,       

253
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,321
a dragster is at least 50 times more powerful

254
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,456
than a subcompact car.     

255
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,128
with fat rear tires for traction
and a tapered aerodynamic body, 

256
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,733
the dragster is engineered for one thing only -- speed.  

257
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,537
production begins       
with the heart of the vehicle --

258
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,806
the powerful 8-cylinder engine.

259
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:51,876
to reduce drag, the engine block
is made of lightweight aluminum.

260
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:56,548
a technician carefully installs
the camshaft...        

261
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,416
and then fastens the timing cover        

262
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,085
to the front of the engine.  

263
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,220
the timing cover prevents oil leaks.      

264
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:06,691
he installs the crankshaft and hub.    

265
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,626
and once the eight rods and pistons   

266
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,295
have been loaded and connected,

267
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,831
he tests their movement and function.  

268
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,299
satisfied with their performance,    

269
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,235
he encases them in an oil pan. 

270
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,305
with the installation of the drive gears       

271
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,508
and other components, the engine block is now complete. 

272
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,710
they move on to the supercharger,      

273
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,447
a forceful blower that boosts engine power tremendously.   

274
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,518
this worker seals the seams  
with urethane and caps the ends.

275
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,121
he slides strips of teflon between the rotors       

276
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,922
for extra sealing.       

277
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,990
all this sealing will ensure  

278
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,658
that the compressed air generated           

279
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,594
is directed down through the bottom of the supercharger 

280
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,596
and into the engine.      

281
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,731
with the supercharger     

282
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,933
now installed in its magnesium casing,    

283
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:54,072
he connects a cage-like starter
to its drive pulley.      

284
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,207
it's now time for a test run.        

285
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,076
blue streamers have been attached       

286
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,211
to the bottom of the supercharger.      

287
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,147
their fluttering is a visual indication     

288
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:05,417
of the force of the air generated.           

289
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,751
the next employee       

290
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:11,756
attaches fuel pipes to the dragster's metal skeleton. 

291
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,159
they install the engine and the high-tech clutch.   

292
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,896
this racing clutch is equipped with five discs  

293
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:21,699
to transfer power from the engine directly to the wheels. 

294
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,501
between every run,       

295
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,638
the dragster engine will be completely rebuilt.  

296
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,973
the rebuild should take just 22 minutes.  

297
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,508
so the team at the factory   

298
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,979
is on the clock to prove it can be done.    

299
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,650
the technician torques the cylinders to the engine block. 

300
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:41,186
he installs the fuel-distribution system  

301
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,322
and connects the hoses to the cylinder heads.     

302
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,594
dragsters run on nitromethane, known as top fuel in the sport.

303
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,998
it delivers more power per stroke.          

304
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,333
still on the clock, the crew transfers the supercharger   

305
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,937
to the engine and connects it to the intake manifold.    

306
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,340
they use super-strength kevlar strapping        

307
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:06,411
to restrain the supercharger in the event of an explosion. 

308
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:10,281
they loop a belt over the gears
that drive the supercharger.  

309
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,755
they adjust the engine valves...

310
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:20,692
and then check to confirm the valves move freely.    

311
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,628
they cover the valves with this titanium lid     

312
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,965
to prevent oil leaks      
and keep all the parts in place.

313
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,835
a technician connects spark plugs to the engine   

314
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,005
through slots in the cover, two per cylinder.       

315
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,511
with each step carefully timed and executed,         

316
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,647
it has taken 22 minutes for the crew          

317
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,251
to get this dragster engine in rip-roaring shape.     

318
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,790
in that 22-minute window,   

319
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,760
they also bolt the back wheels to the axle.          

320
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,068
they then slide the steering wheel into place in the cockpit

321
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,471
and give it a try to confirm that it steers the tires    

322
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,239
at the front of the dragster. 

323
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,610
also part of the 22-minute routine,   

324
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:17,415
a check of the fuel lever and the loading of the parachutes. 

325
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,552
they'll be tested at every pit stop before repacking.   

326
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,088
finally, they fill up the tank with nitromethane fuel.    

327
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,092
this high-performing fuel is both volatile and corrosive,

328
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,762
so there's a protective cover. 

329
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,965
this dragster is almost ready for the starting gate.     

330
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,735
all it needs is a sponsor to pay all the bills.     

331
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,704
one last test of the clutch,  

332
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,240
and this dragster is ready for the track.    

333
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,844
[ engine running ]       

334
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,680
and it's off in a cloud of tire smoke.   

335
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,128
