00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,891
narrator: today, on "how it's made"...   

2
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,921
it's common for pressure to build up           

3
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,191
inside chemical tanker trucks during transport.        

4
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,393
special vents regulate that pressure,     

5
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,595
preventing any unwanted gas build-up,    

6
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,497
which could lead to an explosion.         

7
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,743
pressure relief vents are standard equipment      

8
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,878
on chemical tanker trucks.    

9
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,681
they ensure tanks can hold up  

10
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,553
to the pressures inherent to this industry.    

11
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:32,891
production starts with a bin of wax pellets.         

12
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,960
they use pellets to make models of the vent's parts       

13
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:39,198
in a process called lost-wax casting.     

14
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,835
pellets are fed into an injection machine.    

15
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,506
the wax melts into a mold of the vent's lower housing.   

16
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,183
four wax models are fused to a single wax tree stand.   

17
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,719
the tree stand is left to cure for a couple of hours.      

18
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,122
once cured, a worker dips the wax tree        

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,525
into a slurry of ceramic.    

20
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,794
he removes the stand of wax models,          

21
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,064
then twirls it to drain any excess ceramic.       

22
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:23,141
this is the first of several ceramic coatings.   

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,944
between coatings, he applies silica sand      

24
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,614
to the wet ceramic.       

25
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,882
the sand rains down onto the ceramic,      

26
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,885
creating a stucco effect.    

27
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,824
the first layer of stucco is finally granulated.      

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,461
the next few layers will be coarse.         

29
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,367
by building up progressively coarser layers of stucco,    

30
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,235
he creates a ceramic shell    

31
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,105
with the desired thickness and strength.          

32
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:59,978
the final layer of sand is very coarse.         

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,715
air pumps through the sand as the worker dumps the models.             

34
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:08,053
this process ensures uniform coverage of the heavier sand.  

35
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,658
they bake the forms next, melting out the wax       

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,262
and hardening the ceramic into shells.           

37
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,800
next, a team pours blazing liquid steel into a ladle.    

38
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,534
the ceramic shells have been heated         

39
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,471
to around 3,000 degrees in an oven.           

40
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:30,042
workers pour hot, liquid steel into the hollow tree.      

41
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,148
they add a chemical sealer, then top the molten metal    

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,917
with a piece of ceramic-fiber insulation.   

43
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,632
after about 3 hours in an oven,              

44
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,034
the steel castings are solid.  

45
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,036
a worker shatters the ceramic,  

46
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,440
revealing the vent-housing parts.     

47
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:07,578
a powerful circular saw slices the parts off the tree.     

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,182
workers clean off any ceramic residue.       

49
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,720
computer-guided tools calibrate           
the pressure-vent housing part  

50
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,123
to precise specifications.    

51
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,831
after cleaning and polishing, the part is complete.      

52
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,533
it's time for assembly.     

53
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,337
the worker starts with the top of the pressure vent.      

54
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,075
a large spring is inserted to aid pressure relief.     

55
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,544
a metal plate is added to seal the top of the vent   

56
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,213
to the lower part.        

57
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,551
the lower vent housing is then seated on the metal plate.    

58
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,421
he moves the assembly under a hydraulic ram.      

59
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,623
the ram presses the lower housing,        

60
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,827
the sealer plate, and the spring to a specific tension.      

61
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,365
he then screws the lower housing to the top of the vent.     

62
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,901
a metal ring inscribed with the vent's model      

63
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,404
and flow rate is attached at the top.     

64
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:16,581
this chemical tank pressure vent is now ready for testing.    

65
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,085
the technician screws it to the test stand.        

66
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,921
he activates a system      

67
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,591
that forces compressed air into the vent.          

68
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:30,929
this confirms whether the vent works at the desired setting.  

69
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,465
once approved, he attaches a cover       

70
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,701
to shield the vent from rain and snow.       

71
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,472
the trackable serial number   

72
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,874
is etched into the top using a laser.          

73
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,652
this vent is now ready to prevent hazardous situations.           

74
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:15,240
narrator: the candy wafer is a classic american treat.   

75
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,242
invented in 1847,        

76
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,245
it's a thin, lightweight disk of sugary candy.         

77
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,248
it's softer and dissolves faster than hard candy.     

78
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,252
you can bite into it right away              

79
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,588
or let it melt in your mouth.  

80
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,925
these candy wafers come in eight different flavors.            

81
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,461
the original roll has a random assortment     

82
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,929
of 38 pieces.          

83
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,799
part of the fun is seeing how many of your favorite flavors  

84
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,935
you get.             

85
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,471
this factory makes one flavor at a time.            

86
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,874
the first step is to add food coloring     

87
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,611
and flavoring to pulverized sugar.       

88
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,945
this pink color         

89
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,715
and mint flavoring produces a wintergreen taste.  

90
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,086
corn syrup comes next,      

91
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,822
along with a binding solution of vegetable gums        

92
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:07,692
and gelatin dissolved in water.             

93
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,694
after mixing for about 8 minutes,       

94
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,832
the candy dough's consistency is checked.     

95
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,634
if it isn't thick, elastic, or sticky enough,    

96
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,305
more binding solution is added 
until the dough is just right.  

97
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,110
workers divide the dough into chunks,           

98
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,045
then feed them into a dough shooter.      

99
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,114
this is the first station on the wafer-forming line.    

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,717
the black dough is licorice flavor.       

101
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,652
a conveyor returns leftover dough      

102
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,854
from the end of the line     

103
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,490
to be reused for making new wafers.      

104
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,729
they're pushed through a slot, forming the dough sheet     

105
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,732
that's 20 inches wide by about an inch thick.     

106
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,802
this yellow dough is lemon flavored.        

107
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,010
a steady sprinkle of cornstarch           

108
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,947
prevents the sheet from sticking to the equipment.           

109
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,550
rollers compress        
and stretch the dough forward,  

110
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,753
flattening the sheet to an inch thick.        

111
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,956
the next station stamps     

112
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,825
on the company logo, then cuts out the wafers.    

113
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,429
the cutter moves up and down 180 times per minute.      

114
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,099
the wafers fall through a gap  

115
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,602
to a moving conveyor belt below.             

116
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,174
the conveyor belt moves the wafers         

117
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,043
to a multilevel tunnel dryer.  

118
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,717
they pass through the dryer   

119
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,419
13 times over the course of an hour.   

120
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,596
these green wafers are lime flavored.        

121
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:55,734
the dryer temperature is about 150 degrees fahrenheit,           

122
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,802
warm enough to remove half of the moisture       

123
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,805
without melting the sugar.    

124
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,875
these brown wafers are chocolate flavor.      

125
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,077
once out of the dryer, the wafers            

126
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,613
pile up in trays without sticking.        

127
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,619
workers stack the trays in a drying room.        

128
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,756
it's heated and humidified with steam.    

129
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,559
the candy wafers stay here until their moisture level    

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,063
drops to between 0.75% and 1%.  

131
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,501
the factory tests a few samples             

132
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,171
using a device called a penetrometer.      

133
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,241
it measures the force required to penetrate the candy wafer   

134
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,577
to the point of breaking it.   

135
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,649
this ensures the candies are the correct consistency.   

136
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,518
when the trays come out of the drying room,     

137
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,189
workers send the candies to the packaging line.      

138
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,125
the colors are mixed together,  

139
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,863
ensuring every roll of candy has a random assortment of flavors.            

140
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:03,067
the wafers flow into channels,  

141
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,236
which stand them on their sides.             

142
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,809
workers grab about two rolls' worth,     

143
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,877
then fill two channels of a feeder           

144
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,113
that takes them to the wrapping station.     

145
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,018
another worker fills in the gaps,        

146
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,820
ensuring each roll has 38 pieces.          

147
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,090
the wrapping machine cuts printed,          

148
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,825
translucent paper wrapping    

149
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,696
and applies a bead of glue to one edge.           

150
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,699
in a matter of seconds, the machine lifts the roll    

151
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,102
into the wrapper, seals the edges,         

152
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,437
and twists the ends closed.   

153
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,040
as the sealed rolls move on a conveyor belt,       

154
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:46,510
heated blocks iron the twisted ends flat.      

155
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,380
each candy wafer roll weighs 2 ounces.         

156
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,584
workers pack 24 rolls per retail box,         

157
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,120
then pack the boxes in shipping cases.        

158
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,192
in addition to a traditional roll with assorted flavors,   

159
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,329
the factory also        
produces chocolate-only rolls.  

160
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,031
production has modernized over the years,         

161
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,333
but the recipe itself hasn't changed much    

162
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,002
since the first candy wafer   

163
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,040
rolled off the production line in 1847.   

164
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,289
narrator: food trucks used to only sell sandwiches       

165
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,159
and other prepackaged food. not anymore.           

166
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,227
the modern food truck is a mobile restaurant      

167
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,630
with a full kitchen inside.   

168
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,297
food is cooked fresh       

169
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,667
and sold to customers through a service window.    

170
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,976
most food trucks are standard panel trucks.    

171
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:55,446
their cargo area is a fully equipped commercial kitchen   

172
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,149
with a service window on one side.           

173
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,722
they're usually customized by boutique companies,      

174
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,193
so there's no standard method.  

175
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,996
however, certain modifications to the panel trucks are common,             

176
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,665
like enhancing the truck's suspension system  

177
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,601
or reinforcing the flooring and walls      

178
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:20,138
to support the kitchen's weight.             

179
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
the lighten the load, this company           

180
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,275
builds the kitchen's structural components      

181
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,145
out of aluminum bars rather than heavy steel.     

182
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,883
once the pieces are cut,     

183
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,819
a worker assembles, then welds them together.    

184
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,959
this structure will support a stainless-steel countertop.  

185
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,502
workers cut the countertops and cabinets           

186
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,971
from thick sheets of stainless steel.       

187
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,044
they bend the sheets using a machine called a press break.             

188
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,919
for this countertop,       

189
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,989
they bend a 90-degree angle on the front end         

190
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,159
to form a 1.5-inch square edge.              

191
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,529
to construct walls and ceilings,            

192
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,399
they rivet thin sheets     
of stainless steel or aluminum  

193
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,234
to panels of wood.        

194
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,073
fire-retardant plywood is used for the kitchens.    

195
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:34,479
the boards are installed over styrofoam insulation.    

196
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,815
they leave the truck's aluminum floor as is.      

197
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,753
once the walls, ceiling, and flooring are complete,    

198
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:46,891
it's time to install the kitchen's cabinets and counters.            

199
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,893
workers screw each counter support       

200
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,961
to the wooden structure of the wall,           

201
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,865
then fasten the countertop with rivets.           

202
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,641
they peel off the film      

203
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,344
that was protecting the stainless-steel surface.   

204
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,783
next, they install the major appliances,      

205
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,651
which include a commercial refrigerator,    

206
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,887
freezer, and cooking equipment.           

207
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,858
then the electrical box is installed.          

208
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,594
they connect wiring for the outlets,         

209
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,730
lighting, water heater, water pump,           

210
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,765
and air-conditioning system.   

211
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:38,009
the generator is installed underneath the nearest counter.            

212
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,145
it supplies the truck with electricity.        

213
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:45,149
next to the electrical box is the power-transfer box.     

214
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,884
it contains a switch       

215
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,021
that enables the truck to use an outdoor power source.             

216
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,090
the switches for the interior and exterior lighting      

217
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,326
are underneath the electrical box.       

218
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,234
workers install the light fixtures,       

219
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,037
cabinetry, sink, and serving window.       

220
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,043
they also install the gas lines              

221
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,313
that power the commercial cooking equipment.        

222
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,515
this truck has several gas appliances --    

223
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,586
a six-burner gas range with large oven,         

224
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:26,224
a deep fryer, a charcoal grill,             
and a flattop cooking surface.  

225
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,795
the kitchen is equipped with a ventilation hood     

226
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,531
over the cooking area.      

227
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,933
its powerful fan gathers smoke  

228
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,737
and sends it out a vent on top of the truck.       

229
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,507
it's time to outfit the exterior.     

230
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,547
some food trucks are painted, but most use graphics      

231
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,216
that are digitally printed on adhesive vinyl.        

232
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:00,557
after positioning each panel of the design,          

233
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,826
they apply heat with a torch.  

234
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,428
this removes trapped air,    

235
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,699
stretching the vinyl over rivets and other protrusions.      

236
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,773
this mobile eatery is ready to roll with a kitchen             

237
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:19,777
that meets fire-code and food-service regulations.  

238
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,452
it may not provide the ambiance of a sit-down restaurant,    

239
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:31,923
but when a food truck pulls up, you never need a reservation.  

240
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,406
narrator: rope has been made out              
of plant fibers for centuries.  

241
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,410
stronger synthetic       
and steel cords are available,  

242
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,213
but there's still a market for traditional twine.      

243
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,551
they have their own unique strengths,        

244
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,955
and that's why we are still bound by their ties.       

245
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,895
woven from manila, sisal, or flax fibers,         

246
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,099
traditional ropes are a binding element in our world.             

247
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,501
they're easier to grip      

248
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:22,106
and stretch less than synthetics.      

249
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,975
at this deep and narrow building,       

250
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,110
they've been twisting fibers into rope    

251
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,579
for more than two centuries.   

252
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,916
they're still producing rope the old-fashioned way.      

253
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:36,320
the process starts with racks of natural-fiber yarns.     

254
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,023
the yarns are funneled through separators,       

255
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,859
which configure them to twist evenly together.    

256
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,061
the fibers then travel through tubes    

257
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,131
that squeeze them into bundles.            

258
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,866
workers tie the ends of the bundles          

259
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:53,671
onto a wheeled vehicle called the forming machine.   

260
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,872
they roll the machine back    

261
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,341
until there's no slack in the bundles.         

262
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:01,612
the machine is then sent to the opposite end       

263
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,249
of the factory, over 1,000 feet away.      

264
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,288
as the machine travels backwards, its gears   

265
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,626
turn hooks, twisting the yarns into a tight configuration.   

266
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,161
the formation of the twists   

267
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,230
ensure an even distribution of tension.           

268
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:24,034
this is what makes rope so strong.            

269
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,371
this long, indoor space is called a ropewalk.      

270
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,041
there aren't many of them left in the world.        

271
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,447
halfway down, a worker places a trestle    

272
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,317
underneath the twisting yarns.  

273
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,321
this keeps them off the floor and prevents tangling.      

274
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,458
when the machine reaches the back wall, it stops,             

275
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,895
and workers cut both ends of the strands.         

276
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,798
they tie them to posts      

277
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,802
to maintain tension and prevent unraveling.     

278
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,142
the twisted fibers stretch    

279
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,612
from one end of the building to the other.          

280
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,685
on one side, they tie three of the strands  

281
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,156
to a machine that will transform them into a rope.   

282
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,297
halfway down, they bring in a cart       

283
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,133
that holds a piece of grooved wood known as a top.              

284
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,805
they tuck the twisted strands into the grooves of the top.   

285
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,645
they then roll the cart     

286
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,781
down to face the rope-making machine.     

287
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:49,320
a worker ties rope       
around the strands in the top.  

288
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,656
this holds them in place as the rope-making machine    

289
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:57,194
twists the three strands into one.            

290
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,365
the cart rolls along rails propelled by twisting action.  

291
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,406
it leaves newly formed rope in its wake.           

292
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,742
the rope machine with twisting hooks       

293
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,278
remains in the same place.    

294
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,616
when the cart arrives at the opposite side       

295
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,087
of the building, the rope is formed.       

296
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,357
a worker removes the ties around the top.     

297
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,692
they now have a piece of rope  

298
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,694
that's over 700 feet long    

299
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,363
and almost 5 inches in diameter.            

300
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,237
they slice the rope at both ends.          

301
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,709
then they wind it onto a big spool,        

302
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,578
packing it into a tight coil.  

303
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,450
this traditional rope      
is almost ready to be shipped.  

304
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,120
the customer requested looped ends      

305
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:01,325
for securing the rope with a shackle.         

306
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,928
so, the rope-maker unravels the ends        

307
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,799
and pierces the rope with a hollow tool called a fid.              

308
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,935
he makes a loop         

309
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,604
and slides the unraveled strands through the fid.         

310
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,608
he finishes the job by weaving the strands      

311
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,876
into the rope.          

312
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,283
they're ready to test a segment of the rope.      

313
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,619
two hydraulic jaws pull it until it breaks.     

314
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,860
the rope must be able to handle 55 tons of force.   

315
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,698
traditional ropes have the strength to carry on,    

316
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,535
as they have done for a very long time.
