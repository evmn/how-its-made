00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:26,358
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,260
pre-inked stamps...

5
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,665
...cranberries...

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,271
...cotton yarn...

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,610
...and road signs.

8
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,188
"paid," "rush," "approved" are some of the terms

9
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,256
routinely stamped onto documents.

10
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,325
professionals, such as engineers,

11
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,794
have their official stamps, too.

12
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:06,131
for years, you had to dab the stamp on an ink pad

13
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,399
for each impression.

14
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,637
nowadays you can get stamps with the ink built right in.

15
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,909
the process begins with a design

16
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,679
that either the stamp company or its customer creates

17
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,282
with standard graphics software.

18
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,950
they print the stamp design onto paper

19
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:29,021
using a high-quality laser printer,

20
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,491
then place the printout under an imaging camera.

21
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,467
they feed in a blank sheet of negative film...

22
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:50,642
...then photograph the printout.

23
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,045
30 seconds later, out comes the negative.

24
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,716
the design is light, the background dark.

25
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,653
now they can begin making the mold for the stamp.

26
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,054
they apply the negative

27
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,323
to a plate of light-sensitive polymer --

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,392
a plastic-like material.

29
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,463
then they vacuum out the air to prevent defects in the mold.

30
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,604
then they expose the polymer plate to ultraviolet light

31
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,339
for approximately three minutes.

32
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:25,143
the u.v. penetrates through the
light part of the negative --

33
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,745
the stamp design --

34
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,880
and hardens the polymer underneath.

35
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,815
the rest of the polymer is shielded

36
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,285
by the dark portions of the negative,

37
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,886
so it doesn't change.

38
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,357
a wash cycle then scrubs away this unhardened polymer,

39
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,927
leaving behind a perfect mold in the shape of the stamp.

40
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,502
now they cover the mold

41
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,504
with a sheet of synthetic resin
called bakelite

42
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,841
and put it into a machine called a vulcanizer.

43
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,977
the machine heats the bakelite

44
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,313
to just over 309 degrees fahrenheit,

45
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,185
then forces it into the mold using 2 to 3 tons of pressure.

46
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:11,522
after four minutes, the bakelite stamp is ready.

47
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,191
to be more productive,

48
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,129
the factory actually molds several stamps at a time.

49
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,864
next comes the built-in ink.

50
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,133
they screw the bakelite stamp

51
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:25,337
into what's called the pre-ink mold,

52
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,140
then pour in a mixture of ink and gel.

53
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,684
they cover the mold and vacuum out the air,

54
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,720
a process that takes 12 minutes.

55
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,560
the mold then goes into a heat press for 17 minutes.

56
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,165
the press applies 2 tons of pressure to expel excess ink

57
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,903
and heats the ink gel to about 260 degrees fahrenheit,

58
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,173
transforming it to roughly the consistency of a marshmallow.

59
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,976
so it won't overcook,

60
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:08,614
the mold goes onto a special cooling table for 12 minutes.

61
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,590
next, it's set out to cool for another 45 minutes,

62
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:23,128
this time on newspapers, which soak up more excess ink.

63
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,004
finally, they wrap the mold in paper towels and newspapers

64
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,741
and vacuum out the last drops of excess ink.

65
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,357
then they quickly seal the back
of the stamp to lock the ink in.

66
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:02,167
now they can cut apart the individual stamps.

67
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,780
they glue the stamps by hand

68
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,316
onto the base of the stamp handles.

69
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,528
before they're shipped out to the customer,

70
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,265
all stamps undergo a quality-control check

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,868
to make sure they'll leave a lasting impression.

72
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,615
narrator: cranberries are one of just a handful of fruits

73
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,218
that are native to north america.

74
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,086
before the europeans arrived,

75
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,956
the indians used them for food and medicine.

76
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,025
the cranberry vine is well-suited

77
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,026
to a harsher climate.

78
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,296
it thrives in low temperatures

79
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,566
and loves acidic soil that's scarce in nutrients.

80
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:18,042
cranberries are ripe for the picking in late september.

81
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:22,113
at harvesttime, farmers flood their fields

82
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,117
to make the cranberries float to the surface.

83
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,589
then they use a machine called a beater.

84
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,992
it generates underwater turbulence,

85
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,229
pulling the berries off the vines.

86
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,010
the beater is suspended from a mobile bridge

87
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,012
that's computer-guided

88
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,215
to systematically work its way through the entire field.

89
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,523
the beater cuts a swath about 23 feet wide with each sweep.

90
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,965
workers move the floating cranberries

91
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,701
to one corner of the field...

92
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:25,010
...where a pump transfers them to a waiting truck.

93
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,453
along the way, the berries get a preliminary rinsing

94
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,856
to remove branches and leaves.

95
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,062
at the factory, the truck unloads its cargo.

96
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,865
the cranberries travel along the water canal

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,334
and onto a conveyor belt,

98
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,870
then through a cleaning station,

99
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,205
where workers use brushes and water jets

100
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,108
to get rid of any remaining leaves and branches.

101
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,014
then they dump the cranberries into large bins

102
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,751
to be frozen for up to several months.

103
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,287
to produce cranberry juice,

104
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,822
they defrost the frozen berries
in hot water,

105
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,026
then mash them -- skins, seeds, and all --

106
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,561
into a puree.

107
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,164
they add special enzymes to break up the pectin molecules,

108
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,970
making the puree less viscous and therefore easier to press.

109
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:29,374
the press processes almost 9 tons of puree at a time.

110
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,376
that's the weight of 1 1/2 elephants.

111
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:37,115
it takes three to four pressing
cycles to extract all the juice.

112
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,653
the juice then goes through a sophisticated filtration system.

113
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,521
the 216 filters

114
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,793
remove any plant particles or bacteria larger than one micron.

115
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:54,666
a micron is about 25,000 times smaller than an inch.

116
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,535
then they evaporate the water

117
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,005
until the juice is 10 times more concentrated.

118
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,607
cranberries not destined for juice

119
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,609
go through a grading process.

120
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,278
undersized berries drop down

121
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,682
through the holes of a giant sifter.

122
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,618
the bigger cranberries move on to the grading table,

123
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,788
where workers remove any that are substandard.

124
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,831
an electronic sorter

125
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,034
then scans the remaining cranberries for color,

126
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,370
signaling an air gun

127
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,306
to blow any reject berries off the production line.

128
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,109
the rest move on to the packaging department

129
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,379
or continue down the line to be dried.

130
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,915
cranberries destined for drying

131
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,318
are automatically seeded, cut in half, and pressed,

132
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:52,524
then soaked in a sugar-and-water
solution to make them sweeter.

133
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,327
the side-to-side motion of the conveyor belt

134
00:09:56,363 --> 00:10:00,365
spreads the berries thinly so that they'll dry evenly.

135
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,201
the hot-air dryer subjects them

136
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,673
to temperatures varying from 86 to 176 degrees fahrenheit.

137
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,211
after about three hours,

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,548
the cranberries come out looking like this.

139
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,356
as you sip your cranberry tea, ponder this --

140
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,026
cranberries are a source of potassium

141
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,661
and vitamins "a" and "c,"

142
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,229
and drinking cranberry juice

143
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,867
can prevent and treat urinary tract infections.

144
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,311
narrator: twisting plant or animal fibers into yarn

145
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,312
dates back to ancient times,

146
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:52,050
when people fashioned primitive
spindles out of sticks.

147
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,651
around 500 b.c.,

148
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,987
the spinning wheel was born in india.

149
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,990
today's factories have fully automated spinning machines

150
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,994
that work on the same principle
as the spinning wheel.

151
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,732
this is a 2-ply commercial yarn,

152
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,401
the kind factories use to weave fabric

153
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,803
for making jeans and tops.

154
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,008
it's made from large bales of raw cotton.

155
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,010
cotton comes from a plant,

156
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,945
so, naturally, some leaves and stems

157
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,349
are mixed in with the cotton fibers.

158
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,019
to remove them, the first machine passes over the bales

159
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:32,023
and removes a layer of cotton .2 of an inch wide...

160
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,961
...then sends it through a duct system

161
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,164
to the blending and cleaning machine.

162
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,303
the machine processes half a ton of cotton per hour.

163
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,639
the cotton comes out evenly blended and cleaner,

164
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,775
but still not clean enough,

165
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,377
so it goes into a second cleaning machine,

166
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,081
which finishes the job.

167
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:12,130
now the cotton goes through what's called a carding machine.

168
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,466
it has huge rollers with wire teeth.

169
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,001
they comb out the tangled fibers

170
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,838
and line them up in parallel rows.

171
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,940
the machine also discards

172
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,944
any fibers that are too short to process.

173
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,216
next stop -- the coiler.

174
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,684
this device takes the rows of fibers

175
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,021
and forms them into a thick and loose first-stage yarn

176
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,790
called sliver.

177
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,966
the slivers move on to the drawing machine.

178
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,369
it lines them up six at a time and draws them out,

179
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:56,107
stretching them to form a second-stage yarn.

180
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,514
then a machine called a roving frame

181
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,316
stretches this second-stage yarn,

182
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,252
strengthening it by thinning it out...

183
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,725
...until it looks like this.

184
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,795
this third-stage yarn is called roving.

185
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,265
depending on the type of yarn they're making,

186
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,936
it's anywhere from 3 1/2 to 16 times thinner than sliver.

187
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,075
they now stretch the roving up to 30 times thinner,

188
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,411
which strengthens it even more.

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,481
the yarn is finally finished.

190
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,287
now they have to transfer the yarn from all these small spools

191
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:48,226
onto huge, industrial-size cones -- 20 spools to a cone.

192
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:52,162
one transfer method uses the winding machine.

193
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,701
it winds the yarn from the first spool onto the cone.

194
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,771
then it automatically takes the back end of that yarn

195
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,172
and attaches it with a knot

196
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,310
to the front end of the yarn from the next spool.

197
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:09,047
it winds it onto the cone, then attaches the back end

198
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,849
to the front end from the next spool and so on.

199
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,985
as each spool empties,

200
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,688
the machine automatically discards it.

201
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,662
and while all that winding is going on,

202
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,798
the machine's optical sensor --

203
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,734
that white object you see crossing the screen --

204
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,936
does a quality-control check.

205
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,073
if a portion of yarn doesn't meet specifications,

206
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:39,009
the winding stops, the machine cuts off the offending portion,

207
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,313
then reconnects the ends and resumes winding.

208
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,885
this is air-jet spinning,

209
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,820
another method of making yarn from slivers

210
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:53,758
and winding it onto giant spools
known as tubes.

211
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,869
a suction tube grabs the front end of one spool

212
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,638
and connects it to the back end
of the previous one,

213
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,741
again with a tiny knot.

214
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,178
before fully automated machines
like this

215
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,847
were invented 50 years ago,

216
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,116
all that knotting had to be done by hand.

217
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,852
the thin, finished yarn

218
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,854
is 200 times lighter than the thick, first-stage yarn

219
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,658
that came out of the carding machine.

220
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:32,196
from start to finish, spinning this yarn has taken 48 hours.

221
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,137
narrator: you might not have noticed,

222
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:44,342
but road signs have undergone a subtle change in recent years

223
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,344
thanks to advances in technology.

224
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,081
today's signs are more reflective than ever.

225
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,351
you can actually read them in the dead of night,

226
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,553
even when the only source of illumination

227
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,622
is your car's headlights.

228
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,298
the earliest road signs were crude --

229
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,833
a stick in the ground

230
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,569
or a heap of stones to mark a route.

231
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,370
in the roman empire,

232
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,308
stone posts were erected along roadsides at regular intervals,

233
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,844
indicating the distance to rome.

234
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,779
centuries later,

235
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,116
stone-marker systems gave way to wooden cross signs

236
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,185
pointing in several directions at once.

237
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,789
the international system of road signs we know today

238
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,926
came out of the first international road congress,

239
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,995
held in 1908.

240
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,739
the process of manufacturing a road sign

241
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,474
starts with a computer.

242
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,342
the government strictly regulates

243
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,211
the specifics of the design

244
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,950
and requires a certain degree of reflectivity.

245
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,219
the computer's specialized software guides a machine

246
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,589
to cut the design on a sheet of film.

247
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,492
once the design is cut,

248
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,963
workers carefully peel off and discard the pieces.

249
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,634
what's left is a film stencil of the sign --

250
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,570
in this case, a french stop sign.

251
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,577
they inspect it for defects,

252
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,914
then prepare a screen of polyester fabric

253
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,850
that they'll later use to print the sign.

254
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,585
they start by coating it

255
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,522
with a thin layer of light-sensitive emulsion.

256
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:41,659
once the emulsion is dry, they adhere the film stencil

257
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,128
using vacuum pressure to flatten it

258
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,331
and get rid of any creases or air bubbles.

259
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,271
then they expose the screen to an intense, 6,000-watt light

260
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,406
for seven minutes.

261
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,408
this activates the emulsion

262
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,445
on the lettering and area outside the octagon --

263
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,148
what's not shielded from the light by the film stencil.

264
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,884
this exposed emulsion hardens,

265
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:10,154
plugging the minute holes between the screen's fibers.

266
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,891
after rinsing, you see the result.

267
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,094
elsewhere in the factory, workers cut the aluminum panels

268
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,830
on which the signs will be printed.

269
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,968
using a punch press, they round out the edges.

270
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,437
they make holes for the bolts

271
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,573
that will later attach the sign to the post.

272
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,576
they stamp on the company name and the year of manufacture

273
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,379
for warranty purposes.

274
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,982
they immerse the panels in a chemical bath

275
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:41,452
to remove grease and other residues.

276
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,187
then they rinse off the panels

277
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,856
and dip them in an acid solution
that seals the metal

278
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,993
to make it better withstand harsh weather.

279
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,597
next, they laminate the aluminum panels

280
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:57,001
with a film containing miniscule glass particles.

281
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,737
this film will make the sign reflect in the dark

282
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,239
when light hits it.

283
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,349
then they cut the panel to the final shape.

284
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,095
now they can finally print the sign.

285
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,897
the process they use is called silk-screening,

286
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,967
although the fabric screen, as you saw earlier,

287
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,369
isn't actually silk.

288
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,971
it's polyester.

289
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,108
the machine forces the ink down through the screen

290
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,508
onto the panel.

291
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:42,112
the ink penetrates through the open fiber holes of the octagon,

292
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,516
printing the red background on the stop sign.

293
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,586
but it can't penetrate through the blocked fiber holes

294
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,722
of the lettering and the area outside the octagon,

295
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,792
so those remain white.

296
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,661
the freshly printed signs pass through a dryer

297
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,266
at about 150 degrees fahrenheit
for 5 minutes.

298
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,335
to produce street signs,

299
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,803
workers first laminate aluminum panels

300
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,607
with reflective film for the background color...

301
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,278
...then either silk-screen the street name

302
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,949
or apply self-adhesive reflective lettering.

303
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,221
but it's back to the silk-screening process

304
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,557
for printing multicolored signs.

305
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,026
workers print them one color at a time

306
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,063
with a drying cycle between colors.

307
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:39,170
all the film stencils are carefully stored for future use.

308
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,573
the printed signs go into an oven for a final curing

309
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,509
at 349 degrees fahrenheit --

310
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,312
an hour for a one-color sign,

311
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:52,249
a half-hour per color for a multicolored sign.

312
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,917
the ink is transparent enough

313
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,587
not to block the reflective film
underneath.

314
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,790
therefore, the entire sign, not just the lettering,

315
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,526
is highly reflective.

316
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,196
that maximizes the sign's visibility,

317
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:09,467
thereby minimizing the excuses drivers can come up with

318
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,569
for not heeding it.

319

if you have any comments about the show,
