00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,457
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,861
            yogurt...           

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,832
           candles...           

6
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,371
          neon signs...         

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,077
       and book bindings.       

8
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,788
 your mother probably told you  
 not to put anything with germs 

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,190
         in your mouth.         

10
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,458
       well, it turns out       
         she was wrong.         

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,795
 yogurt is one of the healthiest
       foods you can eat,       

12
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,266
 yet it's chock-full of germs --
    bacteria, to be precise,    

13
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:11,103
 bacteria that are actually good
   for your digestive system.   

14
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,478
    the first step in making    
      fruit-flavored yogurt     

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,147
    is to inspect the fruit.    

16
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,083
workers discard any skin or pits
        that slip through       

17
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,354
     and any pieces that are    
     discolored or bruised.     

18
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,424
      the fruit doesn't go      
     into the yogurt as is.     

19
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,360
  first, they turn it into jam. 

20
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,297
 to give the jam just the right 
       texture and taste,       

21
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,099
     they have to weigh all     
    the ingredients carefully   

22
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,202
       before pouring them      
          in the mixer.         

23
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,042
 the first ingredient is water, 

24
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,844
     followed by artificial     
     and natural flavoring,     

25
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:57,849
 and stabilizers to give the jam
      an even consistency.      

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,253
  certain types of fruit aren't 
  colorful enough on their own, 

27
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,889
      so the factory adds       
      artificial coloring.      

28
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,129
next comes two types of sugar --
      fructose and sucrose.     

29
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:13,999
   the mixer heats everything   
   to 140 degrees fahrenheit    

30
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,334
        to help dissolve        
      the dry ingredients.      

31
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,338
      the machine pumps out     
     and refeeds the mixture    

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,440
    so that it blends evenly.   

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,211
       then more coloring,      
     followed by the fruit,     

34
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,882
 followed by another hour or so 
     of heating and mixing.     

35
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,484
     then they heat the jam     
          to a minimum          

36
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,554
    of 176 degrees fahrenheit   
        for another hour        

37
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:38,557
     to kill off any harmful    
            bacteria.           

38
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,492
     to prepare the yogurt,     

39
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,829
they mix different powdered milk
  products with milk and cream. 

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,765
      for low-fat yogurts,      
     they use fat-free milk     

41
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,234
       and skip the cream.      

42
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,638
      once they've blended      
        the ingredients,        

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,175
  they heat them to 176 degrees 
      fahrenheit or higher      

44
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,577
      for just 30 seconds.      

45
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,378
       that's all the time      
          that's needed         

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,648
   to pasteurize the mixture.   

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,051
  while it's now bacteria-free, 
    there's another problem.    

48
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,253
         milk and cream         
       naturally separate       

49
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:12,390
    because cream is lighter    
    due to its fat content.     

50
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,727
     so on to the next step,    
        homogenization --       

51
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,930
   blending the milk and cream  
            together.           

52
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,134
    the homogenizer's pistons   
     crush the fat globules.    

53
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:27,072
  this enables the two liquids  
            to merge.           

54
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,542
      the mixture then goes     
     into fermentation tanks    

55
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,545
      heated to 113 degrees     
           fahrenheit.          

56
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,015
    workers pour in a packet    
        of live bacteria        

57
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,884
      bought from a factory     
 that breeds bacterial cultures 

58
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,420
     for the dairy industry.    

59
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,489
fermentation takes 6 to 20 hours

60
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,326
     depending on the style     
           of yogurt.           

61
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,698
    the factory manufactures    
      the yogurt containers     

62
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
   right on the packaging line  

63
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,869
      using plastic sheets      
        and paper labels.       

64
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:15,253
  the machine heats the plastic 
  and molds it into containers. 

65
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,122
      a split second later,     

66
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,124
     it wraps the containers    
        in paper labels.        

67
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,861
        you can view that       
       dual operation best      

68
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,263
 from underneath the machinery. 

69
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,466
  now they fill the containers  

70
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,203
 with the combination of yogurt 
         and fruit jam.         

71
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,805
      to protect the yogurt     
       from contamination,      

72
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,874
      the air in this part      
         of the machine         

73
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,077
     is strictly controlled     
          and filtered.         

74
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,882
 the bacteria in the yogurt is  
 what's known as good bacteria, 

75
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,218
   the type naturally present   
       in our intestines.       

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,221
     they produce a compound    
      called acetaldehyde.      

77
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,892
    that's what gives yogurt    
    its distinctive flavor.     

78
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,764
          the red dots          
     are electronic sensors     

79
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,799
   that verify the fill level.  

80
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,773
  the container covers are made 
  of thin but strong aluminum.  

81
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,043
   first, the sheet of covers   
       passes upside down       

82
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:16,648
 over a printer which stamps on 
      the expiration date.      

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,186
 unopened, this yogurt will stay
  fresh for more than 40 days.  

84
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,259
    then the sheet of covers    
       turns right side up      

85
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,561
        to be heat sealed       
      onto the containers.      

86
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,467
      finally, the machine      
      automatically divides     

87
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,337
    the containers according    
    to whatever pack format     

88
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,006
    the factory is producing.   

89
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,682
     narrator: the invention    
          of the candle         

90
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,218
    can possibly be credited    
      to ancient egyptians,     

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,887
who dipped reeds into animal fat
          and lit them.         

92
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,957
   today's wax candles provide  
     a romantic atmosphere,     

93
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,361
    light when there's power    
  failure, and, when blown out, 

94
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,829
         a grand finale         
     to a rousing rendition     

95
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,732
      of "happy birthday."      

96
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,169
  at the heart of every candle  
            is a wick           

97
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,506
   made from woven or twisted   
          cotton cord.          

98
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,241
  to stiffen up that limp cord, 

99
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,110
   they run it through a tank   
       of liquid paraffin,      

100
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,113
  a wax derived from petroleum. 

101
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,916
    the cord then passes over   
         a cooling drum         

102
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,387
  whose cold surface instantly  
    hardens the wax coating.    

103
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,656
       the now rigid cord       
       winds onto a spool,      

104
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,925
   ready to be cut into wicks.  

105
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,527
        there are several       
     candle-making methods,     

106
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,264
        all of which work       
     on the simple principle    

107
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,466
     that hot wax turns hard    
            and white           

108
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:46,070
 when it comes into contact with
   cold air or a cold surface.  

109
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,140
     this process is called     
        candle pressing.        

110
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,810
    the hot paraffin travels    
      from the holding tank     

111
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,278
     to a set of sprinklers     

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,282
      inside a 20-foot-high     
      refrigerated chamber.     

113
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,152
  the sprinklers shoot the wax  
   upwards into the cold air.   

114
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:05,890
   like falling precipitation   
  transforming into snowflakes, 

115
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,227
   the wax droplets transform   
        into wax flakes.        

116
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,230
      they land at the base     
         of the chamber,        

117
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,565
           then travel          
      to a hydraulic press.     

118
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,101
      the press forms them      
          into candles,         

119
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,970
   using pressure but no heat,  

120
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,607
   and pierces a hole through   
    the middle for the wick.    

121
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,646
      the air in this part      
          of the plant          

122
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,581
         has to be less         
   than 77 degrees fahrenheit,  

123
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,718
  or else the flakes will melt  
       and stick together,      

124
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,454
      jamming the machine.      

125
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,593
     now the candles travel     
     to the wicking machine,    

126
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,697
  which cuts and inserts a wick 
        into each candle.       

127
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,271
  another candle-making method  
     is the dipping process.    

128
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,208
      they install 96 wicks     
          on each frame         

129
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,344
        of an automated         
        dipping machine.        

130
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,745
       one after another,       

131
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,549
    the frames dip the wicks    
 into a tank of clear paraffin. 

132
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,485
          as the frames         
       rise from the tank,      

133
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,021
 gravity pulls the wax downward,

134
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,891
      creating a conically      
      shaped coat of wax.       

135
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,093
      by the time a frame       
      has made the circuit      

136
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,232
    and returned to the tank,   
 the wax coat is hard and white.

137
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,567
          the wicks go          
      for a second dipping,     

138
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,368
  followed by another go-round. 

139
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,838
         this continues         
      until 25 dips later.      

140
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,377
       the tapered candles      
 are .8 of an inch in diameter. 

141
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,780
   to turn these white candles  
      into colored candles,     

142
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:39,150
    they dip them into a vat    
       of dyed paraffin...      

143
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,119
     then immediately after     
         into cold water        

144
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,390
    to harden the color coat.   

145
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,926
   to produce votive candles,   

146
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,529
  the factory uses an automated 
        molding process.        

147
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,200
  they heat each molding table, 
     flood it with paraffin,    

148
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,369
      then cool the table.      

149
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,542
  the wax overflow compensates  
  for the shrinking that occurs 

150
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,745
      during the 20-minute      
        hardening phase.        

151
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,089
      once the wax hardens,     

152
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,759
   they scrape off the excess   
          and remelt it         

153
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,661
   to use for the next batch.   

154
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:36,608
 a pin inside each mold created 
     a channel for the wick.    

155
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,378
 now another type of automated  
 wicking machine inserts a wick 

156
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,248
     and secures it in place    
       with the metal clip      

157
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,684
   at the base of the candle.   

158
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,924
        they make certain       
        specialty candles       

159
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,859
  on a manually operated dipper 

160
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,328
    rather than by automated    
            machine.            

161
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,199
      these altar candles       
      are made of paraffin      

162
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,201
      and 66% pure beeswax,     

163
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,338
   as required by vatican law.  

164
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,940
         to create their        
       cylindrical shape,       

165
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,344
     the worker has to flip     
   the frames after every dip   

166
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,612
      to equalize the wax.      

167
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,617
    it takes 90 dips to build   
       a 3-inch diameter.       

168
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,553
   the candles still come out   
        slightly tapered,       

169
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,223
 so they go through a heated die
     to adjust their shape.     

170
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,428
   no longer just a staple of   
  religion, ritual, or romance, 

171
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,199
    today's candles are a hot   
        decorative item.        

172
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,178
      narrator: neon signs      
     are made of glass tubes    

173
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,982
   bent into letters or shapes  
   and filled with inert gas.   

174
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,185
 when the electric current hits 
  the electrodes in the tubes,  

175
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,456
 electrons flow through the gas,
     making its atoms glow.     

176
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
    the type of gas and glass   

177
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,661
       determine the color      
          of the light.         

178
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,000
     in a clear glass tube,     

179
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,536
 argon gas gives off blue light 

180
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,606
         while neon gas         
       produces red light.      

181
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,408
    to create vivid designs,    

182
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,743
         they can parlay        
      those two base colors     

183
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,945
        into more than 80       
        additional colors       

184
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,281
      by using glass tubes      
        that are colored        

185
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,883
    with fluorescent powders.   

186
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,887
   for instance, blue glowing   
   argon gas in a yellow tube   

187
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,423
     creates a green light.     

188
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,428
   to shape the tube, they use  
   a glass-blowing technique.   

189
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,232
   following a pattern drawn    
   on a fire-resistant sheet,   

190
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,501
    they mark where they have   
        to bend the tube.       

191
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:50,508
 then they heat each spot on a  
 device called a ribbon burner, 

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,980
whose propane flame is a blazing
    1,200 degrees fahrenheit.   

193
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,849
      within half a minute,     

194
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,051
    the glass softens enough    
         to be pliable.         

195
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,786
   they gently bend the tube,   

196
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,855
 then blow into the uncorked end

197
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,657
      to restore the tube's     
       original diameter.       

198
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,995
   with each bend, they check   
 the shape against the pattern, 

199
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,665
     every so often pressing    
  a wooden block along the tube 

200
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,268
     to equalize the width.     

201
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,671
         argon gas emits        
        steel-blue light,       

202
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,076
   but this blue-colored tube   
 will change that to dark blue. 

203
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,279
         after shaping,         
     they cut off the excess    

204
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,948
      and rub the coloring      
      powder off the ends.      

205
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,618
      now they can attach       
      these glass casings,      

206
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,887
    which contain electrodes.   

207
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,223
     they fuse an electrode     
     to each end of the tube    

208
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,691
   using a propane hand torch   

209
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,462
         and a flexible         
       latex blowing tube.      

210
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,034
      they seal the glass       
      around one electrode      

211
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,036
  but leave the other one open. 

212
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,373
    then, using what's called   
       a crossfire burner,      

213
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,242
    they create a tubulation,   

214
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,110
    a thin tube with a bubble   

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,314
 that will act as a passage way 
    into the open electrode.    

216
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,720
    they fuse the tubulation    
      to that electrode...      

217
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,330
    ...then carefully inject    
        a drop of mercury       

218
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,733
       into the open end        
       of the tubulation.       

219
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,670
     argon gas needs a touch    
           of mercury           

220
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,805
 to brighten the color it emits.

221
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,774
        neon gas doesn't.       

222
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,947
       using what's known       
        as an end torch,        

223
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,617
     they fuse the open end     
        of the tubulation       

224
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,421
      to a long glass tube      
  leading to a pumping system.  

225
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,624
   they connect the electrodes  
         to the system,         

226
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,559
        then power it up.       

227
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,497
  the pump vacuums out the air, 
      then injects the gas.     

228
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,401
  the electrical current makes  
   the atoms in the gas glow.   

229
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,776
to trap the gas inside the tube,

230
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,912
  they use the crossfire burner 
    to remove the tubulation    

231
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,915
and seal off the open electrode,

232
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:15,453
 making sure the drop of mercury
  has descended into it first.  

233
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,732
  they dip the back of the sign 
        into black paint.       

234
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,202
  this will make the lettering  
      or design stand out.      

235
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,939
        they use a brush        
    to spread the coat evenly   

236
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,808
     and remove the excess.     

237
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,748
next, they'll light up the sign 
at high voltage for a half hour.

238
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,618
     this will dry the paint    
     and, more importantly,     

239
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,087
  transform the liquid mercury  
           into vapor           

240
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,356
          that spreads          
      throughout the sign.      

241
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,360
    using transparent clips,    

242
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,763
they mount the sign onto a black
      plexiglas background      

243
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,399
 to make it stand out even more.

244
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,043
      finally, they connect     
 the protruding electrode wires 

245
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,845
        to a transformer.       

246
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,449
    this transformer converts   
  the standard 110-volt current 

247
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:22,654
   from our electrical outlets  
   into high-voltage current,   

248
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,790
 into the 3,000 to 15,000 volts 

249
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,426
      you need to light up      
          a neon sign.          

250
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,205
    narrator: hardcover books   
          have bindings         

251
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,873
    made of heavy paperboards   

252
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,543
  covered with cloth, leather,  
           or plastic.          

253
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,147
 soft-cover books have flimsier 
         paper bindings.        

254
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,816
        while bookbinding       
      on a commercial scale     

255
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,484
    is all mechanized today,    

256
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,486
 you can still find craftspeople

257
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,723
    who skillfully bind books   
            by hand.            

258
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,765
     book bindings date back    
     to second-century egypt    

259
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,369
   where christian monks sewed  
   sheets of papyrus together,  

260
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,704
       then enclosed them       
    in leather-covered boards   

261
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,708
  connected by strips of hide.  

262
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,442
    monks in medieval europe    

263
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,245
        stitched together       
     handwritten parchments,    

264
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,314
          binding them          
      between wooden boards     

265
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,649
    often covered in leather.   

266
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,521
 sometimes they were embellished
    with gold leaf and gems.    

267
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,857
        the 16th century        
        saw the arrival         

268
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:36,561
    of cheaper printed books    
with simple pasteboard bindings.

269
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,877
  today, commercial bookbinding 
      is highly mechanized.     

270
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,147
       the process starts       
   with large sheets of paper,  

271
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,984
     each containing several    
 consecutive pages of the book. 

272
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,488
   a worker positions a stack   
  of each sheet into a machine  

273
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,023
      appropriately called      
         the guillotine.        

274
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,895
   its sharp blade drops down   
   and chops off excess paper.  

275
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,765
after trimming, the stack moves 
into a machine called the folder

276
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,501
     which folds each sheet     
         into book size         

277
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:21,239
         with the pages         
       in the right order.      

278
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,174
 as we see here in slow motion, 

279
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:26,977
       the machine starts       
  by perforating the fold line. 

280
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,580
   then the sheet moves along   
        the conveyor belt       

281
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,984
    until it hits the stopper   
        to the far right.       

282
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,586
       that stop position       
     aligns the perforation     

283
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,321
      between two rollers.      

284
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:41,192
 watch in slow motion how those 
   rollers pull the page down,  

285
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,993
      pressing a neat fold.     

286
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,065
   this process repeats itself  
   for each fold of the sheet.  

287
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,804
 the result of all that folding 
 is what's called a signature,  

288
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,140
         a unit of pages        
      in the correct order      

289
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,476
       but still attached       
         to each other.         

290
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,879
        a book is made up       
     of several signatures.     

291
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,283
  another machine now assembles 
   them in the right sequence,  

292
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,419
      along with the cover,     
          for binding.          

293
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,488
    there are many different    
        binding methods.        

294
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,892
       this one is called       
         wire stitching.        

295
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,894
 as we see here in slow motion, 

296
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,164
  the machine drives heavy-duty 
 staples right through the spine

297
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,301
  of the signatures and cover.  

298
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,504
    the staples are cut from    
  steel wire that's so strong,  

299
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:30,774
 you have to tear the book apart
         to remove them.        

300
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,345
 here's another slow-motion look
     at the stapling action.    

301
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:48,593
 this is another binding method 
     called perfect binding.    

302
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,996
    first, a scanner ensures    
    the pages are in order.     

303
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,232
     then the covers go on.     

304
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,866
  with traditional bookbinding, 

305
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,468
    they sew these components   
            together.           

306
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,273
  in the perfect bind process,  
    they glue them together.    

307
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,409
  to do that, the machine first 
   feeds the assembled books,   

308
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:09,614
  spine side down, onto trays.  

309
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,417
  the trays compress the pages. 

310
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,953
      then a saw underneath     
       cuts off the folds,      

311
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,690
    detaching the pages from    
   each other along the spine.  

312
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,159
          but that cut          
      creates a smooth edge     

313
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,496
    to which glue would have    
      difficulty adhering.      

314
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,232
         so a second saw        
       notches the spine,       

315
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:33,170
        creating a rough,       
     glue-friendly surface.     

316
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,106
        the notched spine       
      now runs over rollers     

317
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,808
    that coat it in hot glue.   

318
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,124
            finally,            
   two conveyor belts merge --  

319
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,726
    one with the book's pages   

320
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,263
   assembled with the notched   
     and glue-coated spine,     

321
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,932
          and the other         
     with the book's cover.     

322
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,369
  the machine presses the cover 
         onto the spine.        

323
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,022
      the book now travels      
     along the conveyor belt    

324
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,424
     for another 30 seconds,    

325
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,427
        during which time       
       the glue air dries.      

326
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,499
  by this stage of the process, 
   with either binding method,  

327
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,235
 most pages on the unbound sides
           of the book          

328
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,305
  are still attached by folds.  

329
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,840
     to separate the pages,     

330
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,910
 the books go through a machine 
 called a three-knife trimmer.  

331
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,515
 it cuts the folds off the three
      sides simultaneously.     

332
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,584
    the book is now finished.   

333
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,255
  fine-quality books still have 
         some bindings.         

334
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,660
 but your average book today is 
 wire stitched or perfect bound.

335
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,596
      those newer methods       
      are far less costly,      

336
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,034
     yet still produce books    
  that are sturdy and durable.
