00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:59,391
when it comes to breakfast,     
bacon is one of our favorite    
side orders.

00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,126
bacon is one of our favorite

bacon is now processed and even

15
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,015
bacon is now processed and even 
precooked in factories.         
it all starts with a load of

00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,872
each pork belly goes skin-side  
down on a conveyor belt.        
this conveyor takes the pork    

25

down on a conveyor belt.        
this conveyor takes the pork    
bellies to a long, automated

the skins drop onto another

the skins drop onto another     
conveyor belt to be processed   

30

the skins drop onto another     
conveyor belt to be processed

into pork rinds.                
meanwhile, the meat pieces head

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,527
into pork rinds.

00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,411
solution which will cure the    
pork.                           
salt is funneled into a tank of

then, liquid smoke and other

salt dissolves.                 
then, liquid smoke and other    
flavorings are added.           

46
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:54,706
the pork bellies now pass under 
an injector head.               
its needles repeatedly inject a

its needles repeatedly inject a 
curing solution into each pork  
belly.

as liquid smoke bombards the

smoke.                          
as liquid smoke bombards the    
meat, it adds flavor and color  

58
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:29,541
as liquid smoke bombards the    
meat, it adds flavor and color

meat, it adds flavor and color  
to the surface.                 
the pork bellies are transferred

60
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,910
to the surface.                 
the pork bellies are transferred
to a big oven.                  

61
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,345
the pork bellies are transferred
to a big oven.                  
they'll cook for five hours at a

00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,813
to a big oven.                  
they'll cook for five hours at a
low temperature.                

63
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,349
they'll cook for five hours at a
low temperature.                
that allows the flavoring to

00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:45,156
low temperature.

00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,791
that allows the flavoring to    
permeate the meat.              
now it's into a blast freezer

permeate the meat.              
now it's into a blast freezer   
for a quick chilldown, then into

67
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,295
now it's into a blast freezer   
for a quick chilldown, then into
another cooler for a couple of  

68
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,630
for a quick chilldown, then into
another cooler for a couple of  
days.

another cooler for a couple of  
days.                           
the cooling firms the meat,     

70
00:03:53,733 --> 00:04:01,172
days.                           
the cooling firms the meat,     
which makes it easier to slice. 

71
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,540
the cooling firms the meat,     
which makes it easier to slice. 
the pork bellies head to a      

72
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,975
which makes it easier to slice. 
the pork bellies head to a      
sizing station, where their     

73
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:09,080
the pork bellies head to a      
sizing station, where their     
sides get a quick trim.         

74
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,582
sizing station, where their     
sides get a quick trim.         
they also pass under a metal    

75
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,116
sides get a quick trim.         
they also pass under a metal    
detector to confirm that no     

76
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,585
they also pass under a metal    
detector to confirm that no     
piece of the metal hanger has   

77
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:19,090
detector to confirm that no     
piece of the metal hanger has   
gotten lodged in the meat.      

78
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,926
piece of the metal hanger has   
gotten lodged in the meat.      
after that, the pork bellies are

79
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,927
gotten lodged in the meat.      
after that, the pork bellies are
stacked and wrapped, then stored

80
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,295
after that, the pork bellies are
stacked and wrapped, then stored
in the freezer until they're    

81
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,466
stacked and wrapped, then stored
in the freezer until they're    
ready to be sliced into bacon.  

82
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,535
in the freezer until they're    
ready to be sliced into bacon.  
this is called the slice line.  

83
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,903
ready to be sliced into bacon.  
this is called the slice line.  
here, workers load the meat     

84
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,608
this is called the slice line.  
here, workers load the meat     
slabs into chutes.              

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,343
here, workers load the meat     
slabs into chutes.              
the chutes sway back and forth  

86
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,278
slabs into chutes.              
the chutes sway back and forth  
over a blade, which slices the  

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:48,686
the chutes sway back and forth  
over a blade, which slices the  
meat into bacon-sized pieces.   

88
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,455
over a blade, which slices the  
meat into bacon-sized pieces.   
the bacon falls neatly onto a   

89
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,758
meat into bacon-sized pieces.   
the bacon falls neatly onto a   
conveyor belt.                  

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
the bacon falls neatly onto a   
conveyor belt.                  
another conveyor belt rolls over

91
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,028
conveyor belt.                  
another conveyor belt rolls over
the bacon slices to secure them 

92
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,429
another conveyor belt rolls over
the bacon slices to secure them 
for cooking in a browning       

93
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,098
the bacon slices to secure them 
for cooking in a browning

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,066
for cooking in a browning       
microwave.                      
as the fat cooks off the bacon,

00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,024
but if you win the lottery, this

00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:07,932
could be one way to splurge.    

396
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,600
if you have any comments about  

397
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:11,135
the show or if you'd like to    

398
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,936
suggest topics for future shows,
