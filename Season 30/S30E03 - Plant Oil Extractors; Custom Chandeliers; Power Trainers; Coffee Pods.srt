00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,127
   once the gold-leaf adhesive  
             is dry,            

127
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,797
  he sprays on a coat of clear, 
       high-gloss lacquer,      

128
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,368
  then removes the masking tape 
   covering the side and top.   

129
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,072
   the painter also gold leafs  
           the inside           

130
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,141
 and rim of the light housings. 

131
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,144
 an assembler now installs them 
        in the light kit,       

132
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,751
    then installs an led bulb   
        in each housing.        

133
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:10,556
to make the shade, manufacturers
 mold two half drums of acrylic 

134
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:14,760
and paint them black on one side
     and gold on the other.     

135
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,562
     another painter brushes    
    white lacquer-based paint   

136
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,032
       on the black side.       

137
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:24,370
once the paint dries, he applies
  a coat of diluted brown paint 

138
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:29,641
 in uneven striations to create 
     the look of wood grain.    

139
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,576
  he doesn't let this coat dry  

140
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,645
        because he wants        
       overlapping colors       

141
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,380
    to bleed into each other,   

142
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,050
      so he quickly applies     
         the third coat.        

143
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,590
     he immediately applies     
   the fourth and final coat,   

144
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,325
          diluted gray.         

145
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:52,931
   he spreads it with a cloth   
   using small gentle strokes.  

146
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,601
      he compares his work      
      to the design sample      

147
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,670
    to make sure it matches.    

148
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,974
   then, he lets the paint dry  
      thoroughly overnight.     

149
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,213
 the next day, the first painter
        applies gold leaf       

150
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,151
       to the reverse side      
   of the painted drum halves.  

151
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,821
  again, he coats the gold leaf 
        in clear lacquer        

152
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,823
   and lets it dry overnight.   

153
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,430
   the next day, an assembler   
   takes the drum-shade frame,  

154
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,564
      which has since been      
         painted black,         

155
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,101
          and installs          
      the two half shades,      

156
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:32,871
     locking them into a lip    
  on the top and bottom rings.

00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,510
a worker completes the light kit
   by splicing the nine wires   

158
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,513
   coming from the led lights   
        to a central wire       

159
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,716
   coming out from the center   
     of the kit's top cover.    

160
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,520
 then, workers line up the kit's
 four crossbars with the shade's

161
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,921
            four ribs           

162
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,659
and insert each crossbar through
a notch at the top of the shade.

163
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:56,428
     they screw the top ring    
        to the crossbar.        

164
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,267
      globes are crafted by     
      a local glassblower.      

165
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,203
 the assembler strings each one 
      on a stainless-steel      

166
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,741
          braided cable         
 with a brass check ring on top.

167
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,411
      he sets spring-loaded     
       ball grippers above      

168
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,612
       and below the globe      

169
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,614
    to lock it on the cable.    

170
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,885
   the grippers make the globe  
     vertically adjustable.     

171
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,487
         this chandelier

172
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,823
       each one suspending      
      one to three globes.      

173
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,560
  a brass connecter at the top  
       of the cable screws      

174
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:33,164
      securely into a small     
 threaded hole in the light kit.

175
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,302
     with its creative trio     
  of faux-wood, gold and glass,

      of a fitness regimen.     

180
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,192
    one way to build strength   
       is to lift weights       

181
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,927

 when users pull, push or lift. 

183
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,600
   typically, weights produce   
        that resistance,        

184
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,703
      but some machines use     
 a completely different system.

00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,724
         the fixture is         
       on a robotic cell.       

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,262
  the cell rotates, delivering  
     the parts to the robot,    

204
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,664

205
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,938
    welding the power module

     completes the welding,     

207
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,748

     to the finishing area.     

210
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,695
 a worker grinds the welds flat,

211
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,431
       then, with a finer       
         grinding disc,         

212
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,367
        smoothes them out       
     so that they won't show    

213
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,770
   once the steel is painted.   

214
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,640
    after washing the module    
       in iron phosphate,       

215
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:58,576
   a worker applies a positive  
 electrical charge to the module

216
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,312
       and a negative one       
      to the powder paint.

drawing the paint particles onto
  the surface in an even coat.

00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:12,658
 then the worker bakes the paint
   onto the steel in an oven.

  into the cylinder rod's hole. 

227
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,812

    by how much air pressure    
        the user lets in        

250
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,952
     when pushing the yellow    
   resistance-control buttons.  

251
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,090
 the buttons are attached to air
hoses and wired to the computer.

252
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,428
      the assembler routes      
       a 26-foot-long rope      

253
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,896
   through the central pulley   

254
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,099
    and through the machine's   
     12 additional pulleys.     

255
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,302
        the configuration       
      is designed to enable     

256
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,372
   a wide range of exercises.   

257
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,643
   after closing up the power   
    module with a cover panel   

258
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,446
     and installing the two     
     height-adjustable arms,    

259
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:18,049
     the assembler installs     
 a swiveling pulley on each arm 

260
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,253
 and ties what's called a clevis
    to the end of each rope.    

261
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,590
  the clevis holds a wide range 
      of other attachments.     

262
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,726
   once assembly is complete,   
       an inspector checks      

263
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,730
        for any aesthetic       
     or functional defects.     

264
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,933
   he sets a resistance level,  
    then pulls on the handles   

265
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,004
    to make sure the cylinder   
  sensor is reading correctly.  

266
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,873
 pulling a handle pushes the rod
       into the cylinder,       

267
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,743
   forcing the piston against   
    the incoming air pressure   

268
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:48,079
    supplied by a compressor.   

269
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,349
   because this power trainer   
 uses air, rather than weights, 

270
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:55,754
to produce resistance, users can
   work out at faster speeds,   

271
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,857
  which producers higher power. 

272

273
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,905
    narrator: single-serving    
       coffee pods provide      

274
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,441
  almost instant gratification. 

275
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:20,111
     the concept has changed    
   the way coffee is prepared,  

276
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,181
   no need to wait around for   
 a whole pot of coffee to brew. 

277
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,518
   by simply inserting the pod  
    in a compatible machine,    

278
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,954
 it brews the coffee in seconds.

279
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,329
 these coffee pods are designed 
   to be composted after use.   

280
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,597
   they offer the convenience   
        of a quick coffee       

281
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,668
        without long-term       
     landfill consequences.     

282
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,805
  the process of making coffee  
      pods starts with bags     

283
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:50,741
     of unroasted beans from    
  different parts of the world. 

284
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,478
  these beans will be combined  
   to create specific blends,   

285
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,818
     but first, they must be    
  thoroughly tested and graded. 

286
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,555
 a technician inhales the aroma 
      to sniff out defects.     

287
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,558
    he examines the physical    
     condition of the beans.    

288
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,362
     he's looking for insect    
    damage or fragmentation.    

289
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:15,834
  if he finds too many defects, 
    the lot will be rejected.   

290
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,169
   too much moisture would be   
       another indication       

291
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,905
      that the coffee beans     
        are substandard,        

292
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,043
so he measures the water content
  using an electronic analyzer. 

293
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:32,249
 he roasts samples of the beans 
     in these mini roasters.    

294
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,386
    this unlocks the flavors    
           and aromas           

295
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,855
   in the green coffee beans.   

296
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,391
       the color deepens.       

297
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,526
        the beans harden        
       and double in size       

298
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:46,464
   due to the release of gases  
     and water vaporization.    

299
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:50,135
   for lighter, milder beans,   
    he does a shorter roast.    

300
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:53,004
   for darker, more intensely   
         flavored beans,        

301
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,406
 he roasts them a little longer.

302
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,077
      he inspects the color     
 frequently, and when satisfied,

303
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,880
      he empties the beans      
      into receiving trays.     

304
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:07,285
 fans underneath cool the beans 
      and stop the cooking.     

305
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,888
    roasting has transformed    
     the bitter green beans     

306
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,724
         into something         
    entirely more flavorful.    

307
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:18,029
   the technician grinds small  
 amounts into different glasses 

308
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:24,035
in order to prepare for a flavor
   analysis known as cupping.   

309
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,237
    the q grader takes over.    

310
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,106
 he's a certified coffee taster.

311
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,978
     he inhales the bouquet     
 of the coffee and assesses it. 

312
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,583
  he then pours hot water onto  
  the coffee and lets it steep. 

313
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:42,754
the grounds float to the surface
     and form a thick crust.    

314
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:47,192
he breaks the crust with a spoon
       and inhales again.       

315
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,861
    then, after skimming off    
          the grounds,          

316
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:54,999
he slurps the coffee and ponders
  its flavor, body and acidity. 

317
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,336
      he grades the samples     
          accordingly.          

318
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,874
the highest-grade beans will now
    be made into coffee pods.   

319
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:06,544
      big batches tumble in     
 a computer-controlled roaster. 

320
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,147
 the computer slowly increases, 
         and then drops,        

321
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,750
         the temperature        
     for the desired result.    

322
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,621
  the roaster ejects the beans  
     onto a perforated pan,     

323
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:21,559
  and rotating paddles mix them 
     to dissipate the heat.     

324
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,561
   in this industrial grinder,  

325
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:28,166
  rollers pulverize the coffee  
beans to a specific granulation.

326
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,102
    too fine, and the coffee    
       will taste bitter.       

327
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:36,174
 too coarse, and the full flavor
       won't be extracted.      

328
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,510
     to test the granulation    
          and density,          

329
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,779
     a technician dispenses     
       some of the coffee       

330
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,915
     into a 1-pint container    
       and then weighs it.      

331
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,585
   if the coffee is too heavy   
         and compressed,        

332
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:51,923
     water won't flow easily    
     through the coffee pod.    

333
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:57,796
once it passes the density test,
 the coffee is packed into pods.

334
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,132
   the filter material unwinds  
   through tensioning rollers   

335
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:03,735
  towards the assembly machine. 

336
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,871
    the pod rings, made from    
      plant-based plastic,      

337
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,808
   head in the same direction.  

338
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,945
    a pusher moves the rings    
 into slots on a revolving drum.

339
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:19,817
the system pulls the mesh filler
  material over the pod rings.  

340
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,954
     heated devices descend     
        as the drum turns       

341
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,190
 and seal the mesh to the rings.

342
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:32,831
    formers stretch the mesh    
  to shape it into filter cups. 

343
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,232
 as the drum continues to turn, 

344
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:40,838
depositors fill rows of the mesh
    filter cups with coffee.    

345
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,841
   paper lid material unwinds   
      from the other side,      

346
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,977
        and heat sealers        
      fuse it to the pods.      

347
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,714
  at the same time, the ceiling 
    heads punch out the pods,   

348
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:55,787
  separating them from the mesh 
    and the excess lid paper.   

349
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:59,724
        the coffee is now       
        encased in pods.        

350
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,594
  exiting the drum, an overhead 
  system moves the pods forward 

351
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,997
         to be weighed.         

352
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,868
 this mechanized system produces
    220 coffee pods a minute.   

353
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,372
   each will provide a quick,   
     caffeinated pick-me-up.
