narrator: today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,321
automated machines changed manufacturing forever  

5
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,524
when they began assembling parts.        

6
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:02,795
cnc assembly machines have taken automation to the next level.  

7
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:07,199
cnc is an acronym for computer numerical control.            

8
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,134
the machine is automated by a computer          

9
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,137
rather than by mechanics.    

10
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,074
to design a cnc assembly machine,     

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,144
engineers first analyze the sequence       

12
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:21,080
of tasks required to assemble the product.     

13
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,148
they then match each task    

14
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,051
to a pre-designed processing engine.        

15
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,555
the processing engines are linked together       

16
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,758
in a custom assembly sequence.  

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,159
each engine is programmed    

18
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,562
to control its computer-guided motors,   

19
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,230
which perform the precise motions       

20
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,566
required to execute a task.   

21
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,436
the cnc machine's engines    

22
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,837
are mounted on a sturdy base frame.     

23
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,239
to construct it,         

24
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,576
workers cut steel tubes to the required lengths.     

25
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,213
they grind a joint in each piece...         

26
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,385
...then weld the pieces together            

27
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,722
by melting steel welding wire into the joints.         

28
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,928
they bolt a steel tabletop onto the base frame.       

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,598
it has cutouts for each engine.             

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,267
it's been ground perfectly flat.              

31
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,903
so the engines will be level with each other.         

32
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,612
meanwhile, an electrical technician     

33
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:30,215
is assembling the machine's main control cabinet.      

34
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,885
it contains one industrial computer for each engine.    

35
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,787
a cnc machine has engines    

36
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,357
for performing rotary movements, linear movements,        

37
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,794
and for picking up and placing parts.        

38
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:48,034
the motors inside each engine have their own computers.    

39
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,902
they're programmed to perform movements       

40
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,571
at specific speeds and forces.  

41
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,114
once the main control cabinet is assembled,          

42
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,684
workers bolt it to the base frame.        

43
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:12,058
then they install steel bases for the engines.         

44
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,740
some cnc machines require robotic arms.      

45
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,407
a computer-guided milling machine         

46
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,811
cuts rectangular bars of aluminum,           

47
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,047
shaping them into robotic arm components.   

48
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,286
this precision-measuring device             

49
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:44,457
ensures each milled part meets strict specifications.   

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,562
after the aluminum components  

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,431
receive an anti-corrosion coating,    

52
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,302
workers assemble them into a robotic arm.       

53
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,439
these self-lubricating sleeve bearings         

54
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,075
give the arm the ability to rotate.      

55
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,248
they add a second assembled arm to create a pair         

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,651
that works together to perform an assigned task.   

57
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,126
each arm is controlled by its own motor,        

58
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,497
which follows the commands of the engine's computer.    

59
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,401
this coupling securely connects each robotic arm    

60
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,370
to the shaft of its motor.    

61
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,412
each engine on the machine can have up to eight motors.   

62
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,783
the motors can operate independently or in unison.   

63
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,957
this engine has robotic arms that can pick up, hold,     

64
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,793
and release parts.        

65
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,567
to test the completed machine,  

66
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,968
a high-speed video camera    

67
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,571
captures images at 1,000 frames per second.   

68
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,242
the quality control team slows down the video to analyze             

69
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,079
and fine-tune the accuracy and efficiency of every motion.             

70
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,057
just a few simple taps     
on the operator's touch screen  

71
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,127
can adjust the arm to move a millisecond faster.  

72
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,730
or a millimeter further.     

73
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:36,802
cnc machines can assemble small products at high speed.  

74
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,069
they also provide something   

75
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,605
traditional assembly equipment can't --        

76
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,342
flexibility.           

77
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,412
a single machine can be reprogrammed multiple times   

78
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,914
for assembling different products.       

79
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,038
narrator: when life gives you lemons,   

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,374
why bother making lemonade    

81
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,110
when you can indulge in a luscious lemon tart?    

82
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,579
not too sour, not too sweet,   

83
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,581
a lemon tart is a delectable dessert     

84
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,316
that you can make yourself.   

85
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,652
or even better, leave it to the baking pros   

86
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,287
and buy ready-made.       

87
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,262
this thaw-and-serve lemon tart has a shortbread shell      

88
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,366
and creamy lemon filling topped with buttercream.     

89
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,740
each batch of dough produced in this industrial mixer     

90
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:51,076
yields 449 tart shells.     

91
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,145
the first step is to lightly blend margarine, sugar,     

92
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,048
and salt for 2 or 3 minutes.   

93
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,552
next, add pasteurized eggs    

94
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,289
and mix for about 2 minutes at slow speed.          

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,060
fast mixing makes the dough too tight, causing it to crack.             

96
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,666
they add white flour      
while continuing to mix slowly  

97
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:17,769
until the ingredients are well-blended.        

98
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,771
once the dough is ready, workers             

99
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,242
put it through what is actually a hamburger forming machine.   

100
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,446
it extrudes 1/4-pound dough patties.          

101
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,047
workers place them in the middle             

102
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,251
of a nonstick aluminum tart pan three at a time.         

103
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,390
they mount the pan on a press, covering it with plastic.    

104
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,191
a die strikes the pan,      

105
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,728
flattening and spreading the dough evenly.        

106
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,865
the pans go into the oven,    

107
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,868
where they rotate for 23 to 24 minutes       

108
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,338
at 350 degrees fahrenheit.    

109
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:59,878
the dough bakes into a shortbread tart shell.  

110
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,546
lemon juice and lemon oil    

111
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,183
are the key ingredients in the creamy filling.      

112
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,389
first, workers melt margarine on a stove...          

113
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:21,433
...then mix in sugar,      

114
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,302
lemon powder...         

115
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,675
...and food starch to thicken the mix.       

116
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,147
they blend for 2 minutes, then add eggs.          

117
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,986
after another 5 to 8 minutes of mixing,            

118
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,522
they pour in boiled lemon juice and lemon oil.    

119
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:50,329
boiling these acidic ingredients prevents the fats from curdling.            

120
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,597
the filling is ready.      

121
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,599
so they move the bowl from the mixer          

122
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,934
over to the depositing line.   

123
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,808
a pump transfers the contents to a hopper feeding a depositor.           

124
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,348
the depositor is pre-set     

125
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,452
to squirt 22 ounces       
of lemon filling in each tart.  

126
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,296
the filled tarts go into the oven for 11 minutes.            

127
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,703
the lemon tarts come out of the oven,      

128
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,640
cool at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours,        

129
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:38,443
then go into a freezer overnight.            

130
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,113
the next day, workers remove the frozen tarts     

131
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:42,848
from the pans.          

132
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,929
they gently remove any specks of browning,     

133
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:01,200
then spray on a light layer of glaze made from apricots.   

134
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,201
this adds a hint of sweetness.  

135
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,070
the glaze also prevents the filling from cracking    

136
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,073
when it's thawed for serving.  

137
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,680
next, they put the tart in an automated cake slicer.   

138
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,215
the turntable rotates      

139
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,818
as the tart is cut into 12 slices      

140
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,288
with papers in between each one.       

141
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,489
this is for restaurants     

142
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,326
who serve the dessert by the slice.          

143
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,296
workers embellish each slice   

144
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,498
with a flower made of buttercream,       

145
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,401
a decadent mixture of butter, egg whites, and sugar.      

146
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,708
they complete each flower    

147
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,843
with a dot of lemon filling in the center.          

148
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:50,849
this lemon tart is finished.   

149
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,252
they wrap it in a cardboard cake band     

150
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:56,788
printed with the brand name.   

151
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,591
they seal the tart in plastic film,         

152
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,994
insert it into a retail box,   

153
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:05,864
and ship it frozen to a store or restaurant.    

154
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,599
to serve this tasty dessert,   

155
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,534
you simply defrost at room temperature       

156
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,303
for about a half hour.      

157
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,091
narrator: toy soldiers aren't just for children.    

158
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,361
they're a hobby for grown-ups that dates back over a century.            

159
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,433
the science-fiction novelist h.g. wells            

160
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:42,968
published the first set of rules              

161
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,038
for toy solider war games in 1913.             

162
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,910
the game is on.         

163
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,112
it's time to rally the troops.  

164
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,449
these mini soldiers are made of either metal or plastic    

165
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,253
and hand-painted by the game players.       

166
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:04,322
no detail is overlooked in making these war figures   

167
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,125
true to the historical period of the game.           

168
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:12,798
players move the figures around tabletop scenery     

169
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
like chessmen on a chess board.             

170
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:19,604
and like chess, this is a game of strategy.   

171
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,008
it's a way to engage in the tactical elements of war               

172
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,279
without the violence of a real battle.        

173
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,813
making miniature war figurines  

174
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,484
starts with the construction of a model.           

175
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,420
with only one hand and his prosthesis,       

176
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,122
a modeler expertly bends tin copper wire         

177
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,292
into a framework for the model.             

178
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,430
each soldier needs to be 1.1 inches in length.      

179
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,767
so he shapes and trims the wire accordingly.           

180
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,705
once he completes the wire skeleton,        

181
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,774
he sticks the leg prongs into a cork.           

182
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,911
this enables him to get a firm grip on the skeleton   

183
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,714
as he builds up the figure with epoxy putty.        

184
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,586
he sculpts a base layer using a dental tool       

185
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:13,125
that's usually used for scraping plaque.       

186
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,060
after the base layer cures,   

187
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:19,030
he builds up the chest and calf areas.         

188
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:24,268
after more curing time, he sculpts the soldier's tunic.             

189
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,938
using a tool with a fine point,             

190
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,409
he pits the surface to simulate medieval chain mail armor.    

191
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,079
with skillful artistry,     

192
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,615
the miniature soldier takes shape.           

193
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,622
he inserts a wire        
into a drilled shoulder socket  

194
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:46,658
and applies putty to create a muscular effect.   

195
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,699
he builds up the sleeve and pierces it all the way around  

196
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,436
to continue the chain mail effect.      

197
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,039
he carves the rounded rim of the hat.           

198
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:07,846
this small-scale soldier is in fighting form.       

199
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,314
he's used to make a mold for tin soldiers         

200
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,417
that will look just like him.  

201
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,322
meanwhile, another member of the team    

202
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:22,127
sculpts epoxy putty models that are three times larger.   

203
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,595
these models are used      

204
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,265
to mass-produce plastic war figures.       

205
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,067
going large first and then scaling down      

206
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,372
is the only way to transfer all the details.   

207
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:38,876
as he carves hair details    

208
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,679
into the head          
of this french cavalry figure,  

209
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,350
he's careful to not leave any protruding bits.       

210
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,954
otherwise, plastic could snag on molds made from them,     

211
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,190
jeopardizing the production of the plastic versions.     

212
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,563
with curing time between layers,             

213
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,067
it takes about a week to sculpt this french cavalry model.    

214
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,440
they're ready to make molds   

215
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:11,176
from the smaller scale models now.           

216
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,712
the mold maker arranges the epoxy models    

217
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,981
on a silicone rubber disk.    

218
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,187
he presses each one into the rubber.         

219
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,390
the ends leave little dents.   

220
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,926
he removes the model and slices it into the rubber  

221
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,262
with a surgical scalpel,     

222
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:34,800
cutting holes where the figures have left the indentations.   

223
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:37,202
he removes the silicone cutouts,            

224
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:41,206
then carves a narrow channel to connect the two slots.    

225
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:48,279
he inserts the model into the niche.         

226
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,882
he repeats this process with the other soldiers     

227
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,484
on the disk,           

228
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,687
then places the disk in a preheated steel vessel.   

229
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,891
he puts a lid on the vessel   

230
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:04,229
and transfers it to a vulcanizing press.     

231
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:09,033
in the press, heated plates squeeze it using pressure.    

232
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,235
this softens the rubber inside,             

233
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,706
melting around the figures, picking up the contours.     

234
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:22,414
this transfers the disk into a mold.           

235
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,986
coming up next, the miniatures  

236
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,655
emerge from the mold shell battle-ready.          

237
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,540
narrator: in the age of video games,    

238
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:51,943
tabletop war games still have plenty of fans.    

239
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,078
the challenge begins with the acquisition       

240
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,948
of small armies of miniatures.  

241
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,883
players hand-paint the soldiers            

242
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,020
and build elaborate backdrops with scenery.          

243
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,089
then the games begin.      

244
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,896
as production continues,     

245
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:15,900
the mold-maker carves channels into the silicone disk.     

246
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,902
he links the channels to the impressions        

247
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,705
of miniature soldiers and military machinery      

248
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,807
that have been created by the models.          

249
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,381
the channels allow molten metal to flow into the impressions   

250
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,383
in order to cast copies.     

251
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,986
in the storeroom,        

252
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,922
there are thousands of silicone molds,        

253
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:42,126
each depicting different characters and props.             

254
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,328
when the order comes in,     

255
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,597
an apprentice makes the selection.       

256
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:52,804
next, an operator puts the mold in a casting machine.      

257
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,475
as the mold spins in the machine,         

258
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,412
he adds molten tin       
through an opening in the lid.  

259
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,948
the spinning throws the liquid tin      

260
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,517
into the mold crevices.     

261
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,755
after the casting solidifies and cools,            

262
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,158
he extracts the little tin soldiers.     

263
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,497
these tin war figures are on their way         

264
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,800
to the gaming front lines.    

265
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,171
making plastic war figures starts with an epoxy resin    

266
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,641
for a pattern.          

267
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,976
they add a hardener and blend the batch       

268
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,246
to the consistency of pancake batter.        

269
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,782
they transfer it to a larger bucket        

270
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,917
and place it in a vacuum chamber,       

271
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,519
which pulls out the air.     

272
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,723
in the process, the epoxy swells.        

273
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,193
once the epoxy mixture deflates,            

274
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:51,062
a team brushes it onto sculpted military models  

275
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,398
arranged in a steel box.     

276
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,871
after filling all the crevices, they dispense more epoxy.    

277
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,273
a chute ensures a gentle flow,  

278
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,677
preventing the buildup of more bubbles.         

279
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,812
they repeat this on the other side of the models        

280
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,848
to create a two-part pattern.  

281
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,651
once the epoxy hardens,     

282
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,353
they mill the outside of the pattern          

283
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,956
to pre-determined measurements.          

284
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,759
an employee then opens it and discards the models.     

285
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,762
he inspects the impressions they've left.          

286
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,500
they use this pattern to make a smaller-scale mold from steel.             

287
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,240
using an automated saw, they carve smaller pieces    

288
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,609
from a block of nickel chrome steel.     

289
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,915
an automated milling tool machines the smaller blocks   

290
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,917
so the two of them will fit together        

291
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,086
to create one mold set.     

292
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,057
a carriage shunts the block back and forth          

293
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,526
between an abrasive wheel    

294
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:58,096
to grind the surface to precise measurements.     

295
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,735
a mold-maker follows the impressions     

296
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,004
in the epoxy pattern with a stylus,          

297
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,106
which moves a needle-like cutter.      

298
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,745
the cutter etches a template into the steel block       

299
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,013
that's three times smaller    

300
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,848
than the one in the epoxy pattern.      

301
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,689
using a wand that generates high-frequency vibrations,    

302
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:29,094
he polishes the etchings in the steel mold.        

303
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:30,628
it's a gentle polish       

304
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,631
that doesn't damage any of   
the etching in the mold block.  

305
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,571
they drill channels in the steel              

306
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,974
to allow plastic to flow to the impressions.       

307
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:46,778
they also insert water-cooling pipes.       

308
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,382
they're ready to mass-produce plastic war figures.       

309
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,250
the machine melts plastic    

310
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,654
and injects it under pressure into the mold set.        

311
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,856
the plastic hardens, and the machine         

312
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,794
ejects the little soldiers connected by runners.      

313
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:05,797
this particular production includes miniature rifles    

314
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,999
and other military paraphernalia.     

315
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,604
they pack the plastic soldiers, their horses, and their guns   

316
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,806
into boxes for retail      

317
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:17,308
along with instructions for painting.          

318
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,549
after painting, the plastic soldiers       

319
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,952
and their tin comrades are in tip-top military form   

320
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,088
and ready for battle.      

321
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,690
there will be casualties.    

322
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:37,228
but of course, it's all just for fun.      

323
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,164
these miniature war figures are survivors.          

324
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,234
they will live on to fight many more battles.
