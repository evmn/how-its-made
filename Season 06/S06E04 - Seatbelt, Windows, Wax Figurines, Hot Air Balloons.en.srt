narrator: today on "how it's made,"   

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,826
seatbelts...          

5
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,266
...windows...         

6
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,671
...wax figurines...      

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,144
...and hot air balloons.    

8
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:56,054
it's an indisputable fact that seatbelts save lives.   

9
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,457
when a car comes to a sudden stop,       

10
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,926
the seatbelt prevents you from hurling forward.     

11
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,994
it spreads the stopping force 

12
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,596
across the sturdier parts of your body,         

13
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,498
namely your rib cage and pelvis.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,732
this spreading action     

15
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,335
dilutes the strength of the stopping force,     

16
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,904
minimizing injury.       

17
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,011
before production can begin,  

18
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,946
the factory has to adjust the seatbelt design      

19
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,014
to fit the specific car model, 

20
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,883
to make sure the belt path is clear,           

21
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,619
that there's enough room for rotating parts to move,  

22
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,154
and so on.           

23
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,622
on the factory floor,     

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,693
robots assemble most of the mechanical components. 

25
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,095
this plastic disk, containing a spring and a weight,     

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,697
is part of the locking mechanism.   

27
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,700
it's what stops the seatbelt straps, called the webbing,   

28
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,236
from lengthening when you jerk forward     

29
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,039
due to a sudden stop or hard deceleration.     

30
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,506
the locking mechanism     

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,243
goes into the seatbelt's retractor mechanism,      

32
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,979
the component that lets the webbing extend and retract.

33
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,115
the webbing will wind onto this aluminum spool    

34
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,450
in the retractor,       

35
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,719
a rewind spring keeping it taut.

36
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,056
sudden deceleration will cause this silver ball  

37
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,990
to trigger the locking mechanism.     

38
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,862
this will stop the spool from rotating and lock the webbing. 

39
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,263
this next robot assembles   

40
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,665
what's called the pretensioner mechanism.  

41
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,066
while the locking mechanism  

42
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,068
stops the webbing from lengthening,       

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,671
the pretensioner sharply pulls the webbing back,       

44
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,006
tightening any slack.     

45
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,343
the pretensioner kicks in only in the event of a crash. 

46
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,145
the sudden deceleration on impact triggers sensors   

47
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,081
which signal the air-bag control module   

48
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,684
to send an electrical charge to the pretensioner.      

49
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,086
this charge sets off a tiny explosion        

50
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,222
that deslacks the belt.    

51
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,759
this worker installs the explosive device,     

52
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,096
called the micro gas generator,
or mgg.            

53
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,366
after lubricating the inside of its aluminum cylinder    

54
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,434
with grease,          

55
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,703
she inserts a piston and the mgg.          

56
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,106
the mgg contains a chemical called nitrocellulose.     

57
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,443
the electrical charge coming from the air-bag control module

58
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,780
ignites this chemical, causing a tiny gas explosion. 

59
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,916
that generates pressure within the cylinder,      

60
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,785
driving the piston upward at high speed.         

61
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,522
this triggers a gear that winds
the retractor spool backward, 

62
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,758
taking up any slack in the webbing.        

63
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,930
after capping off the micro gas
generator's housing,      

64
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,333
a robot transfers the completed
pretensioner mechanism     

65
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,735
to the retractor's frame.   

66
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,737
then it screws on a steel cover plate      

67
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,706
to hold the pretensioner in place.           

68
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,811
they install the rewind spring 

69
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,280
onto the spool of the retractor mechanism.  

70
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,217
this spring is what provides resistance  

71
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,419
when you pull out the webbing to buckle up.         

72
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,021
then, when you unbuckle, it rotates the spool      

73
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,223
to rewind the webbing.     

74
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,692
the car company decides what type of spring to use.  

75
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,761
the thicker the spring and the more coils,      

76
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,229
the greater the tension,    

77
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,699
and therefore the faster and smoother the belt retracts.

78
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,234
but the greater the tension,  

79
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,038
the less comfortable the seatbelt is on the body.  

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,640
the webbing is made of woven polyester fiber.   

81
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,510
this machine sews one end over into a loop        

82
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,513
for the pin that'll anchor the webbing to the spool.    

83
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,183
the pin is made of either plastic or steel,  

84
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,252
depending on the type of retractor they're using.  

85
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,588
a worker now threads the end through a machine       

86
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,390
that automatically winds the webbing        

87
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,124
onto the retractor spool,   

88
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,594
making sure the pin is properly attached.     

89
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,265
at the same time, the machine checks the overall belt length 

90
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,569
to make sure it conforms to the client's specifications.

91
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,612
at this factory, every single seatbelt component

92
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,348
has to pass a thorough quality-control check.     

93
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,217
here a machine checks a key safety feature,     

94
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,952
a lever-and-ratchet mechanism 

95
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,555
that prevents the webbing from extending         

96
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,958
after you've belted in a child car seat.       

97
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,628
now for the final assembly.  

98
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,297
workers load          
all the seatbelt parts in a jig,

99
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,433
a holding device that arranges them       

100
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,968
in the proper configuration.  

101
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,770
a worker feeds the webbing through the shoulder loop,   

102
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,106
from which the belt hangs, and through the tongue plate, 

103
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,508
the part that clicks into the buckle.        

104
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,578
both these components are made of steel for strength,

105
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,980
with plastic coverings matching the car interior.   

106
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,383
the last step is to sew the anchor      

107
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,053
to finish off the other end of the webbing.        

108
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,592
every seatbelt design goes through extensive testing 

109
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,327
before going into production. 

110
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,595
this machine assesses     

111
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,732
how much pull the webbing and retractor can withstand  

112
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,267
before breaking.        

113
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,073
this machine tests the webbing's durability,   

114
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,943
running it through 50,000 abrasion cycles 

115
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,213
to ensure the material doesn't wear out.       

116
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,429
narrator: the earliest windows      

117
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,631
were merely holes cut into the walls.      

118
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,434
people living in warm climates left them uncovered,      

119
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,170
while people in harsher climates
used animals skins       

120
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,972
to keep the cold out.     

121
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,508
in the far east, people covered
the opening with paper.    

122
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,109
then came glass panes     

123
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,114
in sashes that swung in or out or hung one above the other.  

124
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,456
this type of window is called a casement window.  

125
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,593
a crank mechanism opens it at an angle.          

126
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,328
to build the window frame, the factory begins       

127
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,532
with 16 1/2-foot lengths of extruded pvc,        

128
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,867
a type of plastic.       

129
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,869
as clamps hold the pvc steady, 

130
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,472
a computer-guided circular saw cuts the sizes required    

131
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,007
for the frame.         

132
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,609
the same machine also cuts the pieces for the sash,    

133
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,879
the inner frame around the glass.       

134
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,816
each frame is made from four pieces,        

135
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,652
whose ends are mitered at a 45-degree angle.      

136
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,264
now workers load eight pieces 

137
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,967
onto a computer-guided welding machine --       

138
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,904
eight, because it welds two frames at a time.     

139
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,571
first a heating block,     

140
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,842
whose temperature is 446 degrees fahrenheit,   

141
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,710
melts the ends.        

142
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,379
then the machine pushes them together.     

143
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,549
they fuse, forming the frame's four corners.         

144
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,955
here's the same process, viewed from above.       

145
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,931
as the melted ends bond under pressure,        

146
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,402
excess pvc oozes out at the joints, then hardens.  

147
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:52,938
the next machine will clean that up.      

148
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,479
a robot reads the profile of the specific frame style.  

149
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,081
then it uses one of several cutting heads    

150
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,684
to shave the excess off the corners.        

151
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,553
from here, the sash and frame go to another area       

152
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,588
to receive hinges.       

153
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,491
meanwhile, workers cut the glass to size. 

154
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,427
they start with a huge sheet, 

155
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,963
measuring about 6 1/2 feet by 10 feet.. 

156
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,499
it's very heavy, about 200 pounds.       

157
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,901
so, they lay it on a specially designed table. 

158
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,438
a blower sends up air through tiny holes.      

159
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,040
this floats the glass just above the surface,    

160
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,742
making it easy to move around. 

161
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,851
they score the glass using a sharp carbide cutting wheel. 

162
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,454
this window will have what's called a thermopane,  

163
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,388
two panes of glass with argon gas in between   

164
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,191
for insulation.        

165
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,927
one of the panes has a transparent metallic coating 

166
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,197
to reflect the heat back into the house.      

167
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,132
they adhere a strip of silicone foam        

168
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,267
around the perimeter of the first pane,       

169
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,936
notching it for a good fit around the corners.      

170
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,607
the foam is covered in a thin, strong polyester film     

171
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,010
to prevent the gas from leaking through.     

172
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,346
the strip is a spacer, creating
a gap between the two panes  

173
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,348
that's just over 1/2 inch wide.

174
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,950
that's where the gas will go. 

175
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,151
they cut a hole at the top of the spacer    

176
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,487
and another at the bottom.   

177
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,155
you'll see why shortly.    

178
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,563
this window features decorative
grid work called muntin bars. 

179
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,099
they're made of aluminum and go between the two panes. 

180
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,835
a worker lays the bars onto the first pane,      

181
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,306
then uses this guide to line them up perfectly straight.   

182
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,310
then she puts the second pane on top.            

183
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,347
it sticks to the exposed adhesive edge of the spacer.  

184
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,385
now the double-paned glass goes through a press,     

185
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,786
whose rollers apply pressure  

186
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,357
to ensure a strong       
and thorough bond to the spacer.

187
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,263
after the glass exits the press,
workers pump in argon gas   

188
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,199
through that hole at the bottom of the spacer.  

189
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,201
the speed of the gas flow is critical.          

190
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,669
if they pump it in too fast,  

191
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,605
it'll mix with the air in between the panes,      

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,609
rather than push it through the
hole at the top of the spacer. 

193
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,211
after plugging the holes,   

194
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,081
they coat the spacer in a polyurethane sealant.   

195
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:20,285
this makes the thermopane completely airtight.      

196
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,654
now it's ready to go in the sash.          

197
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,097
a piece of pvc called the glazing stop holds it there.  

198
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,499
they snap it in place using a roller.        

199
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,836
a little pvc cement      

200
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,905
to seal off any miniscule gaps in the corners,        

201
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,642
then the sash goes into the window frame.     

202
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,049
their respective hinge parts simply snap together.     

203
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:54,953
the last step is to snap the  
frame's crank arm onto the sash.

204
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,473
narrator: making religious figurines out of wax      

205
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,142
is a tradition the french brought to the new world.   

206
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,344
for hundreds of years,     

207
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,347
this delicate craft wasn't open to just anyone.  

208
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,283
the technique remained a closely guarded secret,   

209
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,218
practiced only by monks and nuns

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,722
within the confines of their monasteries and convents.

211
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,898
this artisan uses a centuries-old technique   

212
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,167
to restore antique figurines and to make new ones.     

213
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,036
she begins with pure beeswax, paraffin wax,         

214
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,440
some powdered chalk to make the waxes less transparent,  

215
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,178
and a bit of solid animal fat to make the wax less fragile  

216
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,311
once it hardens.        

217
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,382
she heats the can of ingredients
in a pot of water       

218
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,783
for about two hours,      

219
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,586
until everything's melted and homogenous.        

220
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,923
then she tints the mixture using oil-paint pigments.    

221
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,524
there's no exact recipe.    

222
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,794
she goes by gut feeling, fiddling with various colors  

223
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,464
until she creates the exact skin tone she's looking for.  

224
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,934
once she's certain the color is uniform throughout,     

225
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,536
she pours the mixture through a stocking.      

226
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,538
this filters out any contaminants        

227
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,007
or undissolved particles.   

228
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,810
now she pours the mixture into a plaster mold.      

229
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,780
there's a different mold for each figurine model.    

230
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,485
this one's a baby jesus.    

231
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,555
the wax takes about 10 minutes to solidify.          

232
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,490
the figurine comes out easily, 

233
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,760
because she had greased the mold cavity beforehand   

234
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,829
with filtered sheep fat.    

235
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,699
the figurine at this point   

236
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,834
is firm enough to extract from the mold    

237
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,070
but still soft enough to sculpt.

238
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,514
with a very fine blade that she heats over a flame,  

239
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,452
the artisan now scrapes away the seam left by excess wax   

240
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,789
that oozed out of the gap between the mold's two halves. 

241
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,527
then she runs the figurine through the flame       

242
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,264
just long enough to melt off any wax particles       

243
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,999
left behind by the scraping.  

244
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,734
after smoothing the surface with a solvent,        

245
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,005
she signs the back of the figurine with her initials,  

246
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:31,376
then uses the flame once again 
to melt off the scraped-out wax.

247
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,347
now that the figurine's body is finished,          

248
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,817
she can begin the detail work. 

249
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,020
she melts pine resin with beeswax to make glue,   

250
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,656
then brushes it on the figurine's head.    

251
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,762
then she takes strands of human hair --        

252
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,497
clients often supply their children's hair --    

253
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,767
and soaks them in water.    

254
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,969
she wets strips of fabric, as well.            

255
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,772
then she rolls the hair around a knitting needle    

256
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,107
to make curly locks.      

257
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,510
she winds the fabric over the curls         

258
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,179
to hold them in place until they air-dry.      

259
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,981
if she's pressed for time,   

260
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,317
she'll dry them in the oven on low heat.          

261
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,853
to make bigger curls for a larger figurine,     

262
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,722
she simply uses a thicker knitting needle.   

263
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,992
now, using a hot blade     
to reheat and activate the glue,

264
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,862
she applies each length of curls
individually.         

265
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,145
once she's finished covering the head,       

266
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,881
she attaches a little halo made of brass wire,      

267
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,618
heating the end so that the wax
melts on contact        

268
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,319
and holds it in position.   

269
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,762
now, using a small, pointed tool

270
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,964
that she repeatedly heats on the flame,         

271
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,100
she sculpts the fine facial details --   

272
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:06,304
the figurine's eyes, eyelids, nostrils, and lips.  

273
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,220
again, a little solvent cleans off the wax particles. 

274
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,527
now she brushes the figurine head to toe          

275
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,796
with powder made of pumice and pigment.          

276
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:36,067
this will help the watercolor paints adhere to the wax.   

277
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,637
she paints the eyes, lashes, brows, and lips.        

278
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,018
once the paint dries,     

279
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,554
she applies a touch of varnish to the eyes          

280
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,656
to make them shiny and bright. 

281
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,163
once the varnish dries,    

282
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,901
she dresses the figurine    
and positions it in its setting.

283
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,718
narrator: the first passengers ever to ride in a hot air balloon  

284
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
were a sheep, a duck, and a chicken.     

285
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:32,991
that eight-minute flight took place in france in 1783. 

286
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,726
today's hot air balloons work on the same principle -- 

287
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,328
the burner heats the air,   

288
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,530
the balloon envelope holds the air,         

289
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,066
and the basket carries the passengers.    

290
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,407
hot air balloons fall under  
government aircraft regulations,

291
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,141
so their engineering has to meet

292
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,744
very specific performance and safety standards.     

293
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,946
once the technical design gets approval,         

294
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,015
the factory works on the graphic design.     

295
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,350
the computer renders the graphics into plans    

296
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,553
that resemble a giant jigsaw puzzle.     

297
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,288
each piece has a code number. 

298
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,358
the computer generates a paper template for each one. 

299
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,894
balloons usually fly in the early morning,     

300
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,163
when there's still dew on the ground.         

301
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,166
so, the nylon fabric with which
they make the balloon envelope 

302
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,567
has a silicone coating     

303
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,236
to repel moisture that would generate mold and mildew.   

304
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,306
after tracing each template with grease pencils,      

305
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,707
they cut the fabric by hand  

306
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,242
and mark the corresponding code number          

307
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,145
on the back of each piece.   

308
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,386
then, following the plan,   

309
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,523
seamstresses sew the pieces together like a giant quilt,  

310
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,458
using heavy-duty thread.    

311
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,595
the type of seam they stitch is the strongest possible --  

312
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,997
what you typically see on jeans.

313
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,934
they sew the seams to nylon straps, called webbing.    

314
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,470
these run both horizontally and vertically,        

315
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,737
forming a giant grid.     

316
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,205
should the fabric rip,     

317
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,010
the seam and webbing combined 
prevent the tear from spreading.

318
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,345
hot air balloons often carry a corporate logo.       

319
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,881
workers divide the design into components,        

320
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,484
project each one onto a piece of fabric,    

321
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,486
trace it, and cut it out.   

322
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,888
they first glue,        

323
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,958
then sew the components to the balloon in one of two ways 

324
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,128
either into the fabric,    
or on top of it, as we see here.

325
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,031
stainless-steel aircraft cable 

326
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,302
connects the balloon envelope to the basket below.      

327
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,438
workers slip a plastic sleeve, then a copper sleeve      

328
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,607
over one end, then loop the cable.      

329
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,711
they line the loop with a stainless-steel thimble.

330
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,114
this thimble will protect the aircraft cable       

331
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,983
from damage due to wear and tear.     

332
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:43,621
they crimp the copper sleeve to lock the loop.       

333
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,063
after taking various measurements      

334
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,267
to ensure everything conforms to strict specifications,   

335
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,137
they wrap tape around the sharp
end of the crimp,       

336
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,539
then, using an industrial heat gun,    

337
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,476
shrink-wrap the plastic sleeve over it to seal the connection.

338
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,618
the basket is made of wicker or a similar natural material 

339
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,886
woven over a stainless-steel frame. 

340
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,421
wicker is flexible enough   

341
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,823
to absorb the shock of a bumpy landing.      

342
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,159
they cover the bottom edge with rawhide          

343
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,696
to protect the wicker when it scrapes against the ground. 

344
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,966
they pad, then cover the top edge in suede or leather    

345
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,936
for comfort when you're leaning
on it to admire the view.   

346
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,441
these nylon poles, called uprights, fit into the frame. 

347
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,244
they support the burners above the basket.       

348
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,380
hot air balloons run on propane,          

349
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,716
the same stuff gas barbecues use.       

350
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,987
only a barbecue produces about 70,000 btus of heat,   

351
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,723
while a hot air balloon's two burners together      

352
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:57,928
generate 30 million btus,   
enough to warm a large building.

353
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,398
after connecting the basket  
to the burner frame with cables,

354
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,468
they cover the cables and uprights in protective padding.

355
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,205
then they hook up the hoses running from the burners    

356
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,607
to the propane tanks housed in the basket.     

357
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,744
now for the final assembly.  

358
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,614
first, they tip the basket onto its side.         

359
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,616
then they take those looped cables they made earlier    

360
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,486
and hook one end to the frame of the burner system.     

361
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,823
the other end is already hooked
up to the balloon envelope -- 

362
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,425
one cable to every vertical strip of webbing.       

363
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,497
depending on its size, a balloon
has between 12 and 28 of them. 

364
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,367
they form the skeleton of the balloon,        

365
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,903
carrying the weight of the craft
and its passengers.      

366
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,774
after laying out the balloon envelope,     

367
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,910
they use a fan to inflate it partway with cold air.     

368
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,512
this takes 5 to 20 minutes,  

369
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,848
depending on the size of the balloon.        

370
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,918
then they fire up the burners to heat the cold air.     

371
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,186
it expands to fill the envelope.

372
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,590
the fabric near the burners is fire-resistant.       

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,261
because hot air weighs less than cold air, it rises,    

374
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,196
pulling the balloon upright and off the ground.      

375
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,798
you control vertical movement 

376
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,600
by manipulating the envelope air temperature.        

377
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,204
to ascend, you turn the burner flames higher.   

378
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,207
to descend, you pull a cord to vent hot air out the top.  

379
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,342
you can't really steer horizontally.         

380
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,212
the trick is to ride different wind currents.    

381
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,220
