00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,321
narrator: ceramic is one of the best insulation materials            

2
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,457
in the world.          

3
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:02,061
grills made with ceramic bodies can bake, roast, smoke,     

4
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,196
and, of course, grill food.   

5
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,999
ceramic grills retain more heat than metal ones,         

6
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,903
resulting in a juicier, more flavorful meal.       

7
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,542
ceramic grills use natural-lump charcoal.    

8
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,279
natural charcoal is made by carbonizing wood       

9
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,816
through a specialized heating process.         

10
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,417
cooking with natural charcoal  

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,487
is just like cooking over a campfire.         

12
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,626
at this factory,        
they begin by making a slurry.  

13
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:37,429
the main ingredients are water, clay, feldspar,    

14
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,366
and other raw materials.     

15
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,835
when the slurry is fired at a high temperature,      

16
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,137
it hardens into ceramic material.      

17
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:53,712
another team assembles the two-part plaster mold    

18
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:57,116
to cast the base of the grill.  

19
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,118
after cleaning off residue from the previous casting,    

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,056
they clamp the parts together.  

21
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,992
the mold has two funnels.    

22
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:09,462
one funnel pumps the slurry into the mold.    

23
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:13,265
the other allows air to exit as the slurry fills the gap   

24
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,434
between the two parts of the mold.           

25
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,940
they let the slurry set for several hours.        

26
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,942
the plaster mold absorbs 80% of the water,          

27
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:28,480
leaving a firm but damp casting.            

28
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,349
they remove the top part of the mold           

29
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,119
and trim off any excess material.       

30
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:39,624
they cut out a rectangular hull for the sliding draft door.   

31
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,295
the door allows cold air to enter the grill.       

32
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,899
then a worker uses a vacuum attached to a hoist       

33
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:51,237
to remove the heavy grill base from the mold.          

34
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,172
they repeat this casting process             

35
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,374
for the other ceramic parts of the grill,          

36
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,510
including the top called the dome and the fire box,    

37
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,914
which sits inside the base and holds the charcoal.     

38
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,052
after each casting,       

39
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,489
they scrape and sand away the excess material.    

40
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:19,064
they roll the cast parts into a dryer           

41
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,400
to remove the remaining moisture.     

42
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,202
for the next 30 hours,      

43
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,537
blowers circulate air      

44
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,474
that's heated to 180 degrees fahrenheit.     

45
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:31,009
after the parts cool, the base and dome        

46
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,947
undergo a final touch up to perfect their exterior surfaces.            

47
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:41,220
next, the parts are taken to an automated glazing station.            

48
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:45,891
a conveyor spins the parts under a shower of ceramic glaze.             

49
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,626
a worker checks the coverage   

50
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,796
and sprays a touch up where required.         

51
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,469
the glaze dries in about 20 seconds.       

52
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,173
workers vacuum up the excess...            

53
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,781
...then temporarily assemble the grill for firing.      

54
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:13,318
they place the fire box inside the base,         

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,257
the base plate         
at the bottom of the fire box,  

56
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,327
and the dome on top of the base.              

57
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,731
they fire the grills in a huge kiln for 24 hours.   

58
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,533
they gradually increase the temperature         

59
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,869
to more than 2,300 degrees fahrenheit,    

60
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:34,873
hold it there for a set time, then gradually cool it down.   

61
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,876
this firing process triggers a chemical reaction   

62
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,279
that transforms the clay-based slurry      

63
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,083
into hard, heat-resistant ceramic.             

64
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:49,354
it also turns the glaze on the surface into black glass.             

65
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,823
after firing,          

66
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:54,827
they attach the stainless steel draft door to the base.     

67
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,297
they spread adhesive      
on the top edge of the base...  

68
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:05,371
...and apply a gasket made of heat-resistant material.            

69
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,908
this creates an air seal    
between the base and the dome.  

70
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,378
then they attach the two parts with a hinge.          

71
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,252
they insert the fire box and stamp it.          

72
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,124
then they glue a gasket around the neck of the dome   

73
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,194
and install the top vent.    

74
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,264
they place the cast-iron grate that holds the charcoal     

75
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,200
and the porcelain-coated cooking grates inside the grill.     

76
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,803
the cast-iron grate holds the charcoal.       

77
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,339
the porcelain-coated grate is for cooking.         

78
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:44,009
finally, they install the thermometer.  

79
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,677
after lighting the charcoal,   

80
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,346
grillers can adjust the air flow with the draft door       

81
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,216
and top vent.          

82
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:51,816
the draft door and top vent   

83
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,553
must be fully closed to shut off the grill.      

84
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:58,123
this cuts off the air supply and extinguishes the fire.    

85
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,637
narrator: many factories     

86
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,508
use punching machines to make the parts they need.   

87
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,844
older punching machines consisted of a large press    

88
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:23,449
powered by a separate hydraulic or pneumatic system.       

89
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,050
today's smaller punching machines        

90
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,054
contain both of these components in a single device.       

91
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,926
these punching machines are used in factories      

92
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,062
that make aluminum window and door frames.         

93
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,466
a factory worker inserts     

94
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,801
a strip of extruded aluminum in the machine          

95
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:46,004
and presses a foot pedal.    

96
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,608
the punch strikes the die, making the required cut.     

97
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,946
they construct the machine out of steel and aluminum,    

98
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,851
both of which arrive at the factory as solid bars.  

99
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,023
first they saw the bars into smaller pieces       

100
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,626
so they can make the machine's various components.       

101
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,771
they place the aluminum pieces  

102
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,573
in a computer-guided milling machine.         

103
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,112
it uses a series of tools to shape the metal        

104
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,348
into a specific component.    

105
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,324
this piece is called a punch guide.          

106
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,325
its job is to align the punch tool          

107
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,162
so that it strikes the die correctly.            

108
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,399
a worker grinds the edges of the part           

109
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,702
until they're smooth.      

110
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,016
a different milling machine cuts more resilient parts    

111
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,283
out of steel bars.        

112
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,152
it, too, is computer guided   

113
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,822
and follows technical specifications.    

114
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,431
this steel component is the punch tool.        

115
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,705
it strikes through a steel die manufactured the same way.    

116
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,910
every machine part        

117
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,312
undergoes a meticulous quality-control inspection.   

118
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:39,851
this computer-guided sensor checks each piece.        

119
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,853
once all the parts have passed testing,       

120
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,721
workers begin assembling.    

121
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,257
the machine's base houses the air cylinder.        

122
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,526
they position the die on top of the base        

123
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,064
and screw it in place.      

124
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,732
then they install the punch,   

125
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,202
carefully centering it over the die.          

126
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,339
a worker hooks up hoses to the air cylinder.       

127
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,808
he tests everything       

128
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,343
to make sure it's properly aligned with the die,      

129
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,212
then he fastens it with screws.             

130
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,082
they install the floor     
of the machine's second level.  

131
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:12,484
a machine can hold up to three different dies     

132
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,353
on three separate levels.    

133
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,624
they position the second die on the guide pins,        

134
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,096
then install the ceiling of the second level.       

135
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,766
they glue the punches to the ceiling.         

136
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,974
this level has several punches,            

137
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,042
allowing the machine to make different cuts      

138
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,845
using the same die.       

139
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,781
the cuts can be simultaneous or continuous.          

140
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,658
they install a punch selector  

141
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,262
which allows users to activate or deactivate each punch.    

142
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,201
once installation is complete,  

143
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,405
they test the alignment of the punches.         

144
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,076
then they mount safety covers on the machine.         

145
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,677
they prevent workers' hands   

146
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,349
from accidentally getting caught between a punch and die.     

147
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:21,086
next, they make the pneumatic system that powers the machine.            

148
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,289
first, they attach air hoses to the foot pedal.        

149
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,691
the operator will step on the pedal            

150
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,226
to punch out the metal.     

151
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,827
then they hook up the other end of the hoses           

152
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,164
to the compressed air-supply line.              

153
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,500
now the pneumatic punching machine         

154
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:40,305
is ready to be used at the window-and-door factory.            

155
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,574
a worker inserts a strip of extruded aluminum       

156
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,044
into the first die to notch the end,        

157
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,512
then into the second die     

158
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:52,985
to punch three holes to join the window-frame parts.             

159
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,654
finally, the third die punches three screw holes    

160
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,389
on the opposite side.      

161
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,727
the machine saves time      

162
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,064
because they don't have to switch dies between each cut.              

163
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:30,088
narrator: water is essential to life on earth.        

164
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,556
we need it to survive,      

165
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,959
but we also use it for entertainment.        

166
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,295
water-jet fountains captivate audiences       

167
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,096
with incredible displays.    

168
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,498
some even use lights to change the appearance     

169
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,568
of the water's color.      

170
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,909
these water-jet fountains send spiraling ribbons of color              

171
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,909
into the air.          

172
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,246
the effect is magical.      

173
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,451
production starts with this cast-bronze part.   

174
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,186
computerized tools        

175
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:06,190
transform it it into a flange that will be installed on-site.            

176
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,060
the flange is designed to prevent leaks where the pipe              

177
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,929
meets the concrete pool.     

178
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,266
the next part          
is a stainless-steel faceplate  

179
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,667
for the fountain.        

180
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,803
an employee places it on a template,          

181
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:22,808
closes a u.v.-light shield, and activates a laser.      

182
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,876
the laser etches product information       

183
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,012
into the steel.         

184
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:32,017
this branding is permanent and won't wear off.       

185
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,354
next, a technician assembles the colored l.e.d. lights.    

186
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,756
he connects the circuitry to a cable,           

187
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,226
then slides the bulb and its housing on to the circuitry.   

188
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,428
he screws a metal ring on to the base          

189
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,764
to keep the light watertight.  

190
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,169
he immerses the light in a clear water tank      

191
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,238
to test it.           

192
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,175
he switches on a vacuum to suck air out of the tank,   

193
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,312
simulating underwater pressure.            

194
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,715
he checks for bubbles around the light,        

195
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,717
which would indicate a leak.   

196
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,792
he programs the light      

197
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,929
for the water show so that   
different colors flash on cue.  

198
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,735
the next employee prepares an epoxy sealant.    

199
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,336
he pours the epoxy        

200
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,540
into the solenoid controller for the water-fountain jets.   

201
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,946
it takes two hours to dry.    

202
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,481
once solidified,         

203
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,617
it will protect the components from water damage.        

204
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,055
then he assembles the carriage for the fountain jets.      

205
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,292
he places the carriage on a spring-loaded slide     

206
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:51,963
and secures it with long-threaded rods.   

207
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,565
the worker applies sealant to the ends of the rods     

208
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,836
and screws on the nuts.     

209
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,172
he installs a plastic nozzle cup.           

210
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,973
he secures it to the carriage  

211
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,243
with a center pin that has a swiveling mechanism.           

212
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,651
he transfers the carriage assembly      

213
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:17,522
to a water-distribution manifold            

214
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,225
and screws it in place.     

215
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,866
he tests the carriage      

216
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,169
and confirms that it slides freely on the springs.  

217
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,809
then he runs plastic tubing   

218
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,077
from the water-distribution manifold             

219
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,381
to the spouts of the nozzle cups.       

220
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,856
the worker secures the joints with plastic zip ties.      

221
00:14:55,963 --> 00:15:00,832
then he trims the ties using a special gun.       

222
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:07,038
he attaches the solenoid controller to the carriage    

223
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,774
and connects the controller to the various air tubes     

224
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,810
that lead to the waterspouts.  

225
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,849
he places the water-jet assembly            

226
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,252
on the back of a steel mounting plate    

227
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,521
and secures it with screws.   

228
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:30,328
he inserts two l.e.d. lights in specially designed slots,   

229
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,564
then screws them in place.    

230
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,803
this water-jet fountain is now complete.         

231
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:43,608
he hooks it up to a compressed air source for a dry-bench test.              

232
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,078
he confirms that the compressed air moves the carriage correctly            

233
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,015
in the programmed sequence.   

234
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,151
he also connects the water jet to a mechanical sequencer    

235
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,721
to verify that it's functional.           

236
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,892
after it passes the tests,    

237
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,828
he seals the perimeter of the jet with a rubber gasket             

238
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,664
and the faceplate.        

239
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:13,505
this water-jet fountain is ready for installation.    

240
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,373
when combined with other fountains,      

241
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,910
it will put on quite a show.   

242
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,578
onlookers will be so engaged,  

243
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,948
they won't mind getting a little wet.      

244
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,868
narrator: people have been surfing on wooden boards     

245
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,737
for thousands of years.     

246
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,071
these early surfboards      

247
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,941
were heavy because they were made of solid wood.       

248
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,944
today, surfers are taking this classic material            

249
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,080
and giving it a modern twist,  

250
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,082
creating beautiful, lightweight boards        

251
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,251
from sustainable resources.   

252
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,756
when most people think of surfboards,       

253
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,891
they picture brightly colored boards     

254
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,026
made of foam and fiberglass.   

255
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,498
but wooden surfboards are making a not-so-surprising comeback.  

256
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,636
every waterborne vessel     
was originally made from trees  

257
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:23,241
because, no matter what, wood floats.   

258
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,449
they start by gluing two planks of poplar to a strip of oak.   

259
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,984
using a template,        

260
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:37,589
a craftsman draws the shape he wants for the surfboard.   

261
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:42,060
he uses a japanese pull saw to cut the shape out by hand.  

262
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,530
this is the basic outline of the surfboard.        

263
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,267
a cnc router quickly and accurately cuts   

264
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,737
the inner support framework from poplar plywood.       

265
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,874
the builder sources wood     

266
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:59,144
from suppliers who use sustainable forestry practices.           

267
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,881
using his pull saw, the craftsman          

268
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,252
carefully frees the pieces of the support framework.    

269
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,692
then he smoothes the edges with a block sander.       

270
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:18,563
he begins fitting the pieces together to form the framework.           

271
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,634
for the spine, the builder uses fast-drying superglue.   

272
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:27,772
it bonds powerfully and quickly, allowing him to work fast.    

273
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,307
after completing the spine,   

274
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,511
he starts gluing and inserting the ribs.     

275
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:37,916
the finished frame resembles the skeleton of a large fish.  

276
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:42,920
once the support structure has dried, the craftsman     

277
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:47,058
places it on the bottom skin of the surfboard.        

278
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,793
he positions it carefully    

279
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:53,064
and securely clamps it in place on a purpose-built jig.     

280
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,004
then he traces the lines of the frame on to the skin.   

281
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,138
he measures and marks a set distance          

282
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,141
from the end of each rib.    

283
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,280
he squeezes a bead        

284
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,016
of epoxy-based glue over the network of lines    

285
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:16,821
before lifting the frame into position on the skin.    

286
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,792
he clamps everything down and lets it dry overnight.    

287
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,297
the sides of the surfboard, called the rails,        

288
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,170
consist of 12 strips of wood glued and clamped together.   

289
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,606
the rails take several days to make.             

290
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,777
after that process is complete,            

291
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,313
the builder lays a bead of polyurethane glue       

292
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:46,650
on the frame and rails.     

293
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,855
then he lowers the surfboard's top skin into position      

294
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,758
and secures it with dozens of clamps.            

295
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,195
he lets the fully assembled board dry overnight.       

296
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:05,069
now the board is ready for the last phase of production.  

297
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,939
first, the craftsman shapes and smoothes the wood      

298
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,342
to give the object its final shape.         

299
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,082
he trims the excess wood off the sides using the rails  

300
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,085
as a cutting guide.       

301
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,892
he rounds the top edges of the board           

302
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,296
with a small, japanese-made wood plane.    

303
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,177
the builder also uses a special tool called a saw rasp              

304
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,045
to finish the edges.       

305
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,848
he uses a square to make sure the bottom and top               

306
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,485
are even when shaping the nose and tail.              

307
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,924
the saw rasp allows him to quickly and efficiently    

308
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,260
bring the board to its final shape.       

309
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,062
next, the craftsman uses a sanding block       

310
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,398
with increasingly finer grits of sandpaper        

311
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,068
to create a smooth surface.   

312
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,874
he signs the bottom of the board with a pencil,          

313
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:21,246
then burns it into the wood with a tool called a pyrography pen.              

314
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,284
he adds a layer of fiberglass and epoxy     

315
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,822
to give the wood a tough outer shell.       

316
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,824
customers can choose to have a fin box        

317
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,025
with a removable fin       

318
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:39,364
or they can opt for a permanent wooden one.   

319
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,099
traditional material plus an innovative design    

320
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,203
results in wooden surfboards that are built to last.
