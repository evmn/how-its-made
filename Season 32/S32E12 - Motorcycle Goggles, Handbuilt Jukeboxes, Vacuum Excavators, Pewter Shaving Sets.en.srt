narrator: the inuit and yupik native alaskan tribes invented 

6
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,725
specialized goggles to prevent snow blindness.   

7
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,660
in the early 20th century,   

8
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,663
a new kind of eyewear was created for airline pilots 

9
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,199
in order to protect their faces from wind.     

10
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,735
soon, motorcyclists started wearing the eyewear      

11
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,271
for the same purpose.     

12
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,608
this manufacturer uses the same tooling process    

13
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,078
used to produce the iconic eye protection   

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,980
worn by the ace pilots of the royal air force     

15
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,016
during world war ii.      

16
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:26,485
production begins with a coil feeder,      

17
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:30,489
which feeds a strip of soft-coil
brass into a press tool.    

18
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,627
the tool stamps out a series of flat blanks.    

19
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:38,096
the press simultaneously punches
two guide holes        

20
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,501
that will help position the blanks on the other tools. 

21
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,903
two raised press tools form the blank           

22
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,307
around a left and right die.  

23
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:52,445
the press tools add new folds and contours to the blanks.  

24
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,684
another press tool stamps out the center aperture.      

25
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,656
a device punches out stitching holes        

26
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,458
that will allow an attachment 

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,327
to connect to a leather face pad.     

28
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,996
a different press tool punctures
the stitching holes      

29
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,799
located along the goggle frame.

30
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,734
due to the age of the machinery,

31
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,337
the distance between the holes has become slightly uneven,  

32
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,074
giving the goggles their distinctive character.  

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:28,280
next, the nose-bridge bracket is positioned on a rivet shaft.

34
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,015
with the eyepiece in place,  

35
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,751
the craftsman triggers the device           

36
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:34,086
to rivet the components together.    

37
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,555
before he attaches the two eyepieces,       

38
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,891
the craftsman polishes each piece against a grinding wheel.

39
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,827
this is a two-step process   

40
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,563
starting with an operation called scarfing,        

41
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,565
which prepares the surface,  

42
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,635
followed by polishing with a special compound.    

43
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,640
the goggle lenses will be installed into the frames   

44
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,776
at a 45-degree angle,     

45
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:00,712
so a grinding wheel casts a 22.5-degree angle      

46
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,048
on each section of glass.   

47
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,517
the craftswoman removes the slight burr        

48
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,921
left by the grinding process with a sanding wheel.     

49
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,257
the lenses are made out of shatterproof laminate     

50
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,592
for additional protection.   

51
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:17,463
the lens frame is made out of a painted brass channel.  

52
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,999
the brass has been annealed for strength          

53
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:24,202
and to remove any internal stresses.     

54
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,873
a small rod is inserted as a temporary support.    

55
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,208
she places the assembly in a clamp           

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,512
and secures the channel in place
with a brass cleat.      

57
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,684
she uses a manual hand press to bend the channel      

58
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,288
to 45 degrees.         

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,025
the craftswoman removes the support rod        

60
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,493
and applies epoxy glue     

61
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:51,430
to the seam between the two sections of glass.   

62
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,367
she inserts a brass cleat to hold the assembly in place, 

63
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,836
and this time the cleat    

64
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:00,172
is permanently fastened to the assembly.        

65
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:05,844
now the eyepiece is ready for the next phase of production. 

66
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,514
the eyepieces are attached to a leather face pad     

67
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,784
made from lamb nappa leather. 

68
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:13,919
a craftsperson starts the process          

69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,788
by using a custom die     

70
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,993
and a 10-ton press       
to stamp out the required shape.

71
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,863
then she uses a leatherworking sewing machine         

72
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:27,266
to stitch the two layers of the face pad together.   

73
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:31,270
with exactly 1.5 millimeters between each stitch,      

74
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,872
the attachment is durable   

75
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:35,174
without overperforating the leather.          

76
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,412
she sews the inner perimeter of the face mask        

77
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,481
with an overlocking stitch.  

78
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,551
this operation is not easy.  

79
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,954
it takes a skilled leatherworker
up to seven months of training 

80
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,023
to become truly proficient.  

81
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,830
before sewing the nose-cover section of the face pad,    

82
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,567
the craftswoman glues the layers together      

83
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,969
to ensure they're assembled correctly.  

84
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,974
after the glue has cured,   

85
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:13,579
the goggle eyepieces are placed
in position over the face pad, 

86
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,382
and the components are stitched together by hand. 

87
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,322
the goggle assembly is almost complete.      

88
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:29,394
the goggle lenses are placed into position         

89
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,531
in the channels of the eyepiece frames.    

90
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,669
now they just need to be secured in place.       

91
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,071
the headband clips attach to the goggles         

92
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,139
and lock in the lenses.    

93
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,877
not only do these handcrafted goggles protect your face,   

94
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,847
you can be assured       
they will never go out of style.

it plays vinyl records,    

105
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:33,058
which are loaded into the machine after purchase.  

106
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,931
a technician builds the cabinet

107
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,001
out of thin, flexible sheets of plywood.          

108
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,937
once five sheets of wood have been glued together,   

109
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,807
the technician places them in a dome-shaped mold.     

110
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:52,144
after glue is applied to the inside of the cabinet, 

111
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,814
team members insert the wood back panel.      

112
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,683
the layers are then held together         

113
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,886
by hydraulic rams for 24 hours.

114
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,956
then workers remove the cabinet
from the mold         

115
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,825
and install shelving and brackets.         

116
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,894
the brackets, or knuckles, are made out of zinc      

117
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,898
and will hold the cabinet door together.   

118
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,966
when a knuckle comes out of the mold,     

119
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,170
the edges are rough and contain excess metal,   

120
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,974
so a technician smoothes the knuckle with a belt sander 

121
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:25,044
and then uses a guide to drill screw holes.     

122
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,785
the factory sends the knuckles 
out to a specialty metal plater,

123
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,520
who plates them with chrome.  

124
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:42,127
the cabinet door consists of a front hoop and a front panel.

125
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,264
technicians place both parts in an assembly jig       

126
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,400
to ensure they are positioned correctly.     

127
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,469
then eight knuckles are connected --        

128
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,673
two at the top and three on each side.    

129
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,476
every jukebox is uniquely handmade,       

130
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,545
so a technician verifies that the door and cabinet   

131
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,614
are aligned accordingly.    

132
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,418
next, both components are moved
to the cabinet-finishing area 

133
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,622
to be painted or stained, depending on the wood.     

134
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,358
the customer selects the color and any options,        

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,827
such as programmable l.e.d. lighting        

136
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,198
or bluetooth connectivity for streaming digital music.  

137
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:26,104
the bubble tubes are handcrafted
from standard glass tubing.  

138
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,573
an artisan seals the tube at the bottom         

139
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,111
then passes a probe to check for any small cracks. 

140
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,846
if the tube is intact,     

141
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,316
tiny silicon crystals are placed at the bottom,   

142
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,185
and fluid that turns from liquid into gas      

143
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:44,056
is poured into the tube at very low temperature.    

144
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,658
the artisan melts the glass with a torch          

145
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,661
to seal the top of the tube.  

146
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,731
each jukebox has four straight bubble tubes          

147
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,799
and four curved ones.     

148
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,070
making a curved tube requires two artisans.     

149
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,671
one heats the tube,      

150
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,875
while the other bends it around a form.         

151
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,344
next, the tubes are placed in a tester,

00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:44,528
the pewter is now in a workable form.      

303
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,133
a technician places the ingot in a machine with steel rollers

304
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,904
and adjusts the space between the upper and lower rollers.  

305
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,944
using 66 tons of pressure, the rollers flatten the ingot. 

306
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,213
it takes several passes through the rollers      

307
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,116
to reduce the ingot to its desired thickness.   

308
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,722
additionally, the rolling stretches the ingot,      

309
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:13,491
transforming it into a large sheet.      

310
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,428
later, the sheet will be used to make the shaving scuttle  

311
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,496
and brush handle.       

312
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:22,299
now it's time to construct the beard combs.        

313
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,104
a technician ladles molten pewter into a rubber mold.   

314
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,106
the centrifugal force forces the liquid pewter    

315
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,309
into the mold's crevices.   

316
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,713
after 2 1/2 minutes, the mold is removed,      

317
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:39,184
producing seven pewter beard combs.      

318
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,053
the technician extracts the combs from the runners   

319
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,922
formed from the molten pewter. 

320
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,794
after sanding, the combs are dipped      

321
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,730
in a specialized solution.   

322
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,868
in a vibrating machine,    

323
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,138
the ceramic pellets shake off most of the excess solution.  

324
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,875
but the solution that's seeped into the embossed logo remains,

325
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,511
adding definition.       

326
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,417
back to the shaving scuttle and brush assembly,      

327
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,387
a large sheet of pewter is cut into discs.       

328
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,492
a technician pours resin into a mold          

329
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,294
to create the shaving-brush handle.   

330
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,431
after the handle's cured for 25 minutes,        

331
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,767
the resin transitions from a liquid to a solid.   

332
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,637
now he has a handle form to work with.         

333
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,972
as the handle spins in a lathe,

334
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,174
the technician shaves off imperfections    

335
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,576
with a cutting tool.      

336
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:44,983
a sharp, circular die cuts out discs from the pewter sheet.  

337
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,056
with the handle core still spinning,        

338
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:54,058
the worker shapes the pewter disc,        

339
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,795
essentially giving the part a pewter skin.         

340
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,933
using the same spinning techniques,          

341
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,271
the scuttle shaving mug are now complete.       

342
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,141
using a natural abrasive mixed with oil,        

343
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,343
the pewter parts are buffed.  

344
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:18,082
this step removes flaws and provides an initial polish.

345
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:22,086
then the maker's mark is carved
into the shaving-scuttle base, 

346
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:26,291
stamping the logo into the pewter.        

347
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:30,027
now that the scuttle-mug parts are assembled,         

348
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,764
a technician solders the base to the scuttle body.      

349
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,902
♪          

350
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,039
a decorative cured handle adds visual interest        

351
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,441
and will provide the user a place to grip.        

352
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,645
a technician adds more solder 

353
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,915
to seal the handle to the scuttle body.      

354
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,518
this shaving scuttle is now complete.        

355
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,521
all the parts will undergo an extensive polishing,    

356
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:00,858
giving the pewter a mirror finish.        

357
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,260
using a buffing wheel,     

358
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:06,064
a technician polishes the shaving scuttle one last time. 

359
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:14,072
finally, this pewter shaving set
is ready to take on stubble.
