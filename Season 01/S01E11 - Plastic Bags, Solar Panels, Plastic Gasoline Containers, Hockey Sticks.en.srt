narrator:
today, on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,694
...plastic bags --
it's trash and carry.

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,467
solar panels --
reflecting on energy efficiency.

6
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:42,840
plastic gas containers --
fuel to go.

7
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,242
and hockey sticks --

8
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,512
mind if we take
a shot at this one?

9
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,120
you can use them for groceries,

10
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,123
for shopping,
for taking out the trash.

11
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,792
chances are there's
a growing pile of them

12
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,794
somewhere in your kitchen.

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,596
with so many everyday uses,

14
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,933
it's easy to see how
people can get "carried away"

15
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,935
with plastic bags.

16
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,142
the plastic bags
we use every day

17
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,145
are made from granules
of linear polyethylene resin

18
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,547
that will be melted.

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,882
they combine
the linear polyethylene

20
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,818
with another low-density one
in this mixer.

21
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,421
the granules
are perfectly blended

22
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,356
into a homogenous material.

23
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,297
granules melt in the extruder,

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,233
which heats them
to a temperature

25
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:47,171
varying between 356
and 465 degrees.

26
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,977
this produces
a film of polyethylene

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,912
in the form of a tube.

28
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,315
it is
several hundred feet long,

29
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,384
has a minimum thickness
of .0002 of an inch

30
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,853
and a circumference
of 20 inches.

31
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,957
the plastic tube
gradually cools down.

32
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,364
rollers then flatten out
the plastic tube.

33
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,877
the polyethylene film
is now easy to work.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,280
and now they cut the tube
on two sides

35
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,482
to obtain different rolls.

36
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,785
this knife then cuts the film
to the required width.

37
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:43,461
the excess strip
is salvaged in this tube.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,769
several hundred of feet of film
are produced and rolled up.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,575
this particular roll contains
the required quantity of film.

40
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,244
when the roll is full,
the film is cut.

41
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,779
this roll moves forward

42
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,649
and can be transported
to another department.

43
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,055
an empty roll begins to fill up
automatically.

44
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:18,061
a full roll weighs 348 pounds
and can produce 35,000 bags.

45
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,332
the next step --
printing on the bags.

46
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,601
this alcohol-based ink
circulates continuously

47
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,403
to retain its viscosity.

48
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,073
impressions are made
by inking rollers.

49
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,478
here another color
is being applied on the bags.

50
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:39,416
once printing is over, the
plastic film is rolled up again.

51
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,120
the roll is now full, and the
cutting of bags can get started.

52
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,092
this machine
makes 150 bags per minute.

53
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,961
a sealer bonds the edges
of the bag together with heat.

54
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,897
the wheel picks up the bag

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,034
and puts them on 2 spindles
that can hold 250 each.

56
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,903
here, they're making bags
with a hermetic zipper.

57
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,172
the zipper is made
from a plastic pad

58
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,208
which inserts into a slot.

59
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,283
the zipper is made in advance
and is unrolled progressively.

60
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,386
the zipper strip is cut

61
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,223
and heat-bonded to the bag
at 356 degrees.

62
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,662
and here's the zippered bag,
all finished.

63
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,534
in this other department
of the plant,

64
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,070
they make plastic bags
with handles.

65
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:37,408
printed bags circulate
on these rollers.

66
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,147
the machine that welds the sides

67
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,283
gives the bags
the desired shape.

68
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,256
then another machine, with
a punch, cuts the handle holes.

69
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:59,629
bags are heat-sealed
and cut at 302 degrees.

70
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,034
here, they fabricate another
product -- packaging bags.

71
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,040
one end of the bag
is heat-sealed.

72
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,275
this machine makes holes

73
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,911
that let air out of the bag
when it is being filled,

74
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,448
to allow them to be
generously filled with items.

75
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:22,253
at this stage, a stamper
cuts the handle holes.

76
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,793
bags are cut
to the required size,

77
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,595
automatically sealing
the other side of it.

78
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,400
this plant makes
eight types of bags,

79
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:40,004
for an overall total
of over one million a day.

80
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,880
narrator:
not so long ago,

81
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,482
solar energy was a concept

82
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,817
that seemed to be torn
from the pages

83
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,420
of a science-fiction novel.

84
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,157
but the time has come for
this non-polluting energy source

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,094
to step into the limelight --
or should we say the sunlight?

86
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,465
the future of solar panels
is bright.

87
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:15,105
the sun is able
to produce electricity.

88
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,975
panels covered
with photovoltaic cells

89
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,110
convert sunlight
into electricity.

90
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,447
this blue plate is a module
made of crystalline silicon.

91
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,382
the grooves are the conductors,

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,586
and the silicon crystals
glisten at its surface.

93
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,055
to make a solar panel,

94
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,992
several modules have to be
connected together.

95
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,995
then they apply a soldering flux
on each module.

96
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,870
the soldering wire
is heated with an iron.

97
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,407
the modules are placed
on a special support.

98
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,743
once the soldering is done,

99
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,012
the modules are cleaned
by ultrasound,

100
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,815
in water, at 140 degrees.

101
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,219
when dried,
the perfectly clean modules

102
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,155
are ready to be assembled.

103
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,558
now they can proceed with
soldering the modules by groups.

104
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,293
first, a flux is applied

105
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,197
which improves
the quality of the soldering.

106
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,167
with great dexterity,

107
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,838
they assemble four groups
composed of nine modules each.

108
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,105
in this way,

109
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,743
36 modules are soldered
and connected in series.

110
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,380
modules are assembled
end to end.

111
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,450
they have to be handled
with great care.

112
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:38,322
using a voltmeter, the voltage
of each module is verified.

113
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,792
at this stage, it's easy
to remake a solder connection

114
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,660
if there's a problem.

115
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,931
if the voltage is adequate,
they use suction grips

116
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,133
to make handling of
the nine rows of modules easier

117
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,836
and to keep them clean.

118
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,544
the modules are placed
into position.

119
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,480
then this metallic strip
is inserted.

120
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,985
it is a conductor that will link
the four groups of nine modules.

121
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,290
solder connections are made

122
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,893
to link the modules
to the metallic strip.

123
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,165
then they put on
this transparent sheet

124
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,766
of layered glass.

125
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,369
it serves as
a rigid transparent form

126
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,971
which will support the modules.

127
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,379
the superposing of parts
forms a laminate,

128
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,883
that increases the rigidity
and solidity of the panel.

129
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:46,290
finally, a sealing film is
applied to protect the module.

130
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,099
to laminate and stiffen
the solar panel,

131
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,801
it's placed in a heated oven

132
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,136
from which air
has been vacuumed out.

133
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,608
the panel will cook
at 176 degrees for 15 minutes.

134
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,544
the oven hermetically reseals

135
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:10,214
to proceed
with the vacuuming out of air.

136
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,016
and here's the finished panel.

137
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,419
all the components
are bonded together.

138
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,953
they now proceed with a test.

139
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,289
the panel is placed
in a solar simulator.

140
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,360
negative and positive contacts
of the solar panel

141
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,696
are connected to a voltmeter.

142
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:34,571
the panel is inserted
into the simulator,

143
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,174
and a powerful lamp
will illuminate it.

144
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,176
the voltmeter is read
to make sure

145
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,147
that panels supply
the electric current required.

146
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,854
here now is the assembly
of another kind of solar panel

147
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,723
called
the amorphous silicon type.

148
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,559
its components were made
in europe and asia.

149
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,664
these are the positive
and negative connecting wires

150
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,333
of the solar panel.

151
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,006
the panel is placed
into a plastic frame

152
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,908
and glued in place.

153
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,182
then the frame is screwed tight
so that it won't move.

154
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,822
the solar panel, made up
of crystalline silicon modules,

155
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,557
is put onto
an a.b.s. plastic frame.

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,093
it is now finished.

157
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:33,497
fabricating this panel will have
required about one hour of work.

158
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,300
six of them are made here
every day.

159
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,976
narrator: your needle's
dipping past empty,

160
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,845
but you're gambling you'll have
enough gas in the tank

161
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,182
to make it
just a little further.

162
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:56,119
well, when you're on that long
walk to the nearest gas station,

163
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,922
you'll be glad someone
had the bright idea

164
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,092
of manufacturing these
handy plastic gas containers.

165
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,731
plastic gas containers
are made from these granules

166
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,200
composed
of a concentrated colorant

167
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,335
and a u.v.-resistant additive.

168
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,071
they're mixed
with white granules,

169
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,606
which is the primary material,

170
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,008
called high-density
polyethylene,

171
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,546
and recycled plastic, which has
been ground up on a granulator.

172
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,149
it's all dumped
into this milling machine.

173
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,851
these granules are all
mixed together and melted.

174
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,422
the melted plastic
will be blown in

175
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,824
and will take shape
within this mold,

176
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,430
made of very high-quality dense
aluminum, called aviation type.

177
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,970
blow-molding continues and
produces a soft plastic tube.

178
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,174
this is cut
and placed in the mold.

179
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:55,912
then this nozzle pumps
the plastic into the mold shell.

180
00:11:55,915 --> 00:12:00,551
the container is unmolded
and moves along on a conveyor.

181
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,256
there's another way
to mold plastic -- by rotation.

182
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,059
this previously colored powder
has a 35 mesh size,

183
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,329
which is just a little larger
than flour.

184
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,065
low-density linear polyethylene

185
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,202
is poured into the bottom
of the mold.

186
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,071
the mold has a cover
that will be closed,

187
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,940
then placed on a steel support.

188
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,344
this support is articulated
by an arm

189
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,147
on two rotation axes
simultaneously.

190
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,483
this action allows
the plastic powder

191
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,819
to distribute itself thoroughly
throughout the mold.

192
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,025
the mold is placed in an oven

193
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,629
which generates
a temperature of 590 degrees.

194
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,169
about 15 minutes is needed for
the polyethylene powder to melt

195
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,706
and another 15 minutes to allow
the piece to adequately cool

196
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,574
before unmolding it.

197
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,048
the mold cover is lifted off,

198
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,051
and the plastic piece
is unmolded.

199
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,853
gloves must be worn,

200
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:13,190
since the piece and the mold
are still very hot.

201
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:17,460
here they fabricate a mechanism
cover for a stationary bicycle.

202
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,997
it's held in place
by a cutting pattern,

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,733
and openings are cut
with a pneumatic tool.

204
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,138
holes are made with a drill.

205
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,278
the casing is now completed.

206
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:41,952
now we get back to the previous
blow-molding process.

207
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,169
this type of molding
produces residues

208
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,105
that have to be eliminated.

209
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,508
these surplus pieces are cut
with this small saw.

210
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,580
the now-hardened scraps
are sent to the granulator

211
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,515
to be reduced into granules,

212
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,852
which will be newly added
into the mixer

213
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,921
to make other plastic
containers.

214
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,331
this small pneumatic drill

215
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,634
pierces
the container's vent hole.

216
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,277
the container circulates
from one step to another

217
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,611
on the conveyor.

218
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,582
the next steps will be
accomplished by robotic arms.

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,753
and then
the final elements are attached,

220
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,555
such as the pouring spout.

221
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:00,764
then a sealing stopper,
equipped with a rubber washer,

222
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,832
prevents leaks.

223
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,768
and finally, the cap of the neck

224
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:08,171
is automatically
screwed into place.

225
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,846
depending on the thickness
of the mold,

226
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,247
the blowing procedure
allows the production

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,718
of between 30
and 120 containers an hour.

228
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,722
the rotation process
takes between 45 and 60 minutes

229
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,190
to make a unit.

230
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,126
finished containers
are now ready

231
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,461
for packing and delivery.

232
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,407
narrator:
few things are as elegant
as curved, polished wood...

233
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,811
especially
at 100 miles an hour

234
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,014
and driving a slap shot
right past the goalie.

235
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,484
a lot of engineering
goes into packing that punch.

236
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:59,056
call it the science behind
"he shoots, he scores."

237
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:08,498
the irish, some 1,200 years ago,
were playing hurling,

238
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:13,703
a form of hockey on grass
with simple goal zones.

239
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,507
in the 17th century, american
indians used curved sticks

240
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,710
in a game they called
"battagaway."

241
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:25,181
the sport we play today was
developed by british soldiers

242
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,518
in 1855 in ontario, canada,

243
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,322
as a pastime
during long northern winters.

244
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,801
making a hockey stick
requires the assembly

245
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,404
of several pieces
of wood and fiberglass.

246
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,339
these sticks are all replicas

247
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,276
of those of great hockey
professionals.

248
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,612
the shaft is made
of a piece of poplar

249
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,215
onto which they glue
two thin strips of birch.

250
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,417
this is placed
on a circular conveyor

251
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,287
equipped with a press
that holds the pieces together

252
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,756
while the glue dries.

253
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,825
then this multibladed saw

254
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,895
cuts the wood into three
identical stick-shaft pieces.

255
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,870
the shafts are moved
to a precision sander.

256
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,243
the shaft has to be reinforced
with fiberglass.

257
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:30,713
with a roller, they apply a coat
of epoxy resin, a kind of glue,

258
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,184
onto which they place
carbon-reinforced fiberglass.

259
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,854
the resin has to dry and harden.

260
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,258
the stick shaft is placed
in an individual mold

261
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:46,196
and cooked in this press, heated
to 176 degrees for 12 minutes.

262
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,198
the shaft then goes
to a milling machine

263
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:52,335
equipped with diamond-headed
knives that round the edges.

264
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,605
a finish is applied to the shaft
for a second sanding,

265
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,608
which brings out
the grain of the wood.

266
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,778
now they glue small blocks
to the end of the shaft

267
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,548
in order to attach the blade.

268
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,016
urethane glue is used.

269
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,884
it resists water and humidity

270
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,220
and is specially made
for hockey sticks.

271
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:14,257
this glue dries in 15 minutes
at 100 degrees.

272
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,898
this slitter cuts the shaft
and wood blocks

273
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,935
in order to slide in the blade.

274
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,707
this machine inserts
the glue and the blade

275
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,209
into the stick shaft.

276
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,914
the stick is placed
on a conveyor

277
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,449
leading it to the next step

278
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,519
and giving the glue
a chance to dry well.

279
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,288
then both sides of the blade
are sanded to thin them.

280
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,027
the sticks are replicas of those
used by hockey professionals.

281
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,497
this computer-controlled
digital lathe cuts the blade.

282
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,034
data on all the cuts
are in the computer's memory.

283
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,410
the blade now has to be curved.

284
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,878
it's steamed for a minute,

285
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,148
allowing humidity to penetrate
the wood and make it flexible.

286
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,483
then the blade is placed
in this curved mold,

287
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,855
where it is heated
for 50 seconds at 131 degrees.

288
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,893
the blade
is then worked by hand.

289
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,962
the new blade is compared
with the pattern

290
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,297
of a hockey player's stick

291
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,332
to obtain precisely
the same curvature.

292
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,608
this is why the company
keeps 6,000 blades on hand.

293
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:45,115
now the blade is sanded down
to the desired thickness.

294
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,124
the blade
must also be reinforced.

295
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,194
fiberglass cloth
is soaked with epoxy resin.

296
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,263
then they place the cloth
on the blade

297
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,132
and leave a good margin
around it.

298
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,733
they get rid of air bubbles,

299
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:08,205
then put it into an oven to dry
at 90 degrees over 24 hours.

300
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:21,084
the surplus fiberglass hardens
and is cut with a band saw.

301
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,688
this step requires quite
a degree of manual dexterity.

302
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,928
finishing is done
with this circular sander.

303
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,903
finally, the blade
is dipped into this epoxy resin

304
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,571
to give it a nice luster.

305
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,240
all that remains
is to paint the stick.

306
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:50,080
here, the company logos
are applied via silk-screening.

307
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,450
besides
the 6,000 personal models

308
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,319
of professional hockey players,

309
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:00,323
this company produces 65 other
models of hockey sticks.

310
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,326
each week,
they make about 40,000 sticks,

311
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:07,130
for an annual total
of 1,600,000.

312
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,804
if you have any comments
about the show,

313
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,474
or if you'd like to suggest
topics for future shows,
