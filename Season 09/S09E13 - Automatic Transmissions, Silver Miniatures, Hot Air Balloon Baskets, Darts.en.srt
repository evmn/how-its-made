00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,691
            narrator:           
    today on how it's made...   

2
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,926
   automatic transmissions...   

3
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,232
     ...silver miniatures...    

4
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,039
  ...hot-air-balloon baskets... 

5
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,744
          ...and darts.         

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,454
    your car's all-important    
          transmission          

7
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,055
 is a system of gears and levers

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,724
      that transfers power      
 from the engine to the wheels. 

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,326
   with a manual transmission,  

10
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,394
   you have to shift the gears  
            yourself,           

11
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,464
      but with an automatic     
          transmission,         

12
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,267
  the car's computer determines 
     when it's time to shift    

13
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,868
 and sends an electronic signal 

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,871
    to activate or deactivate   
      the appropriate gear.     

15
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,742
     the transmission allows    
      the engine to operate     

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,512
  in its most efficient range,  
          or powerband.         

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,822
         it's assembled         
   inside an aluminum housing   

18
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:33,025
  called the transmission case. 

19
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,893
at the heart of the transmission

20
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,162
         are three sets         
       of planetary gears,      

21
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,565
     so named because there     
        are smaller gears       

22
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,435
    rotating around a larger    
          central gear.         

23
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,037
        the first gearset       
   is called the final drive.   

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,774
 it harmonizes the engine speed 
       and driving speed.       

25
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,643
   the final drive is attached  
      to the differential,      

26
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,779
a component that lets the wheels
    move at different speeds    

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,982
      so the car can turn.      

28
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,318
 workers install the steel parts
  connected to the shift lever, 

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,655
       which puts the car       
  into drive, reverse, or park. 

30
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,958
             first,             
    the manual detent lever.    

31
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,262
              then,             
   the forward clutch support.  

32
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,098
  the piece protruding from it  
     is called the park paw.    

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,072
  the actuator rod connects the 
  detent lever to the park paw. 

34
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,608
         it locks a gear        
    that immobilizes the car    

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,109
    when you shift into park.   

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,214
   now for the transmission's   
         five clutches.         

37
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,618
      depending on what the     
    transmission needs to do,   

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,755
  clutches either let gearsets  
  rotate or lock them in place. 

39
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,791
      this clutch is called     
       the forward clutch.      

40
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,028
   by moving the input gearset  
    and the reaction gearset,   

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,465
it enables the car to go forward
   when you shift into drive.   

42
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,239
     two clutches installed     
     as one unit go in next.    

43
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,976
 the coast clutch allows the car
      to coast in low gear      

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,246
   and to brake progressively   
         in higher gears        

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,315
     when you take your foot    
          off the gas.          

46
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,518
        the second clutch       
  is called the direct clutch.  

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,388
  it locks the two gearsets so  
 there's no reduction in speed. 

48
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,191
    next, the reverse clutch.   

49
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,929
  it moves the reaction gearset 
     so the car can back up.    

50
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,934
  a clutch is made up of layers 
 of metal and friction material,

51
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,337
such as resin-impregnated paper.

52
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,075
the transmission's second clutch
       uses both the input      

53
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,677
      and reaction gearsets     

54
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,614
to switch the transmission into 
second, third, and fourth gears.

55
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,086
      with all the gearsets     
   and clutches now in place,   

56
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,088
       workers can connect      
        the transmission        

57
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,624
    to the rest of the car's    
          electronics.          

58
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,460
     these cables are known     
         as the harness.        

59
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,833
    next come the drive chain   
       and two sprockets.       

60
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,701
this hookup is the critical link

61
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,104
   between the transmission's   
            gearsets            

62
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,039
    and its torque converter.   

63
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,709
      the torque converter      
        is the component        

64
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:07,579
    that transfers power from   
 the engine to the transmission.

65
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,916
the sprockets in the final drive
    convert the engine speed    

66
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,051
       to the appropriate       
       transmission gear.       

67
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,255
   the car's computer directs   
  this hydraulic control system 

68
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,156
   to change gears as needed.   

69
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,126
      the computer triggers     
      an electronic switch      

70
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,394
        called a solenoid       

71
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,996
       to open a specific       
         control valve.         

72
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,065
this applies hydraulic pressure,

73
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,335
 which engages the clutch around
  the relevant planetary gears. 

74
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,537
   when the hydraulic pressure  
          is released,          

75
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,007
    it disengages the clutch    
      and locks the gears.      

76
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,877
    now the final connection    
   for the shifting mechanism,  

77
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,015
    linking this manual valve   
      to the detent lever.      

78
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,618
         the shift lever        
     moves the detent lever,    

79
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,288
  which makes the valve direct  
 hydraulic pressure accordingly.

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,691
         this steel bar,        
    called the output shaft,    

81
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,359
   directs transmission power   

82
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,362
      from the final drive      
 at one end of the transmission 

83
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,465
to the driver's side front wheel
        at the other end.       

84
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,238
  next, workers install springs 
           and servos,          

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,574
      part of the hydraulic     
         control system         

86
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,911
 that helps engage and disengage
     the clutches smoothly.     

87
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,851
this tube assembly goes in next.

88
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,321
       the control valves       
      route hydraulic fluid     

89
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,223
       through these tubes      
   to the different clutches.   

90
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,595
    now the torque converter.   

91
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,996
        it spins a shaft        

92
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,667
  that turns the sprockets and  
drive chain that we saw earlier.

93
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,538
 a steel bar called a stub shaft
       is the final link,       

94
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,342
sending transmission power from 
the final drive and differential

95
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,912
       to the front wheel       
     on the passenger side.     

96
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,350
            up next,            

97
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,520
   making silver masterpieces   
      on a miniature scale.     

98
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,492
      narrator: collecting      
    and displaying miniatures   

99
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,828
    isn't just child's play.    

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,430
   it's become a serious hobby  
         for grown-ups,         

101
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,766
    who even buy fine silver    
          in miniature.         

102
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,035
avid collectors spare no expense

103
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,038
       because, after all,      
     it's the little details    

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,706
    that make the difference.   

105
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,448
   in the world of miniatures,  

106
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,585
         there's no need        
 to downsize one's expectations.

107
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,254
       here, you can find       
    all the little luxuries.    

108
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,790
         this silverware        
    is no cheap reproduction.   

109
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,726
       it's a tiny version      
       of the real thing.       

110
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,599
  to make it, silversmiths use  
      tools and techniques      

111
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,469
   that have been handed down   
        over generations.       

112
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,272
       this is a workbench      
     from the 18th century.     

113
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,142
       today, they use one      
    that's nearly identical.    

114
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,479
    to make a miniature mug,    

115
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,549
    workers begin by dividing   
     its measurements by 12     

116
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,218
  so that the finished product  
 will have the same proportions 

117
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
        as the original.        

118
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,693
     next, a strip of silver    
          is rolled out         

119
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,462
 to about 0.02 of an inch thick.

120
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,834
    then, small, round disks    
        are punched out.        

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,439
      a blast from a torch      
          softens them          

122
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,707
      so they'll be easier      
          to work with.         

123
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,377
   a dunking in acid eats away  
         any impurities         

124
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,980
   and leaves a frosty finish.  

125
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,516
       one of these disks       
       is set on a lathe.       

126
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,118
          as it spins,          
     a series of tools begin    

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,888
  to give the thimble-sized mug 
           its shape.           

128
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,926
    any mistake is a big one    

129
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,328
       when you're working      
    in such tiny dimensions,    

130
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,466
so the silversmiths have to work
        with great care.        

131
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,675
  during the machining process, 

132
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,612
        the frosty finish       
  left by the acid is removed.  

133
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,551
 the mug is buffed to add luster
         to its finish.         

134
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,023
        and now it's time       
     to make the mug's base.    

135
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,030
          it's tapered          
     to make a perfect fit.     

136
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,577
small fragments of silver solder

137
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,846
           are placed           
     between the two pieces.    

138
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,855
   then, the parts are heated   
     to almost 1,500 degrees    

139
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,557
     to fuse them together.     

140
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,002
  next, leftover silver pieces  
           are cut up,          

141
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,538
        and the scraps go       
        into a crucible.        

142
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,074
   a pinch of borax is added.   

143
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,611
    this mineral will prevent   
  unwanted oxides from forming  

144
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,746
 as the scraps are melted down. 

145
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,748
   silver is far too precious,  

146
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,485
 so workers don't want to waste 
      even a single scrap.      

147
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,023
   the molten silver is poured  
      into a plaster mold.      

148
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,097
    then the mold is plunged    
        into cold water.        

149
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,634
  the temperature change causes 
     the plaster to explode,    

150
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,571
   exposing three tiny silver   
            handles.            

151
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,713
 one of the handles is soldered 
   onto the little silver mug.  

152
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:46,585
     and now all the pieces     
 of the miniature are in place. 

153
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,920
 next, the miniatures are placed

154
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,523
    in a bucket of steel shot   
        and soapy water.        

155
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,926
       the friction cleans      
       and polishes them.       

156
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,061
the soapy water is strained out,

157
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,931
   and the gleaming miniatures  
          are revealed.         

158
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,134
  each silver miniature has to  
 meet the same purity standards 

159
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,536
  as full-sized silver pieces.  

160
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,872
   in this factory in britain,  

161
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,142
the regulations have been around
         for 700 years.         

162
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,485
        the maker's mark,       
      called the hallmark,      

163
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,454
  is the stamp of authenticity. 

164
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,225
 hallmarking a miniature can be 
         a bit awkward,         

165
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,761
   and some articles are just   
        too tiny to mark.       

166
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,100
          when it comes         
   to replicating silverware,   

167
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,767
  it seems no job is too small, 

168
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,170
      and there are plenty      
      of shining examples       

169
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,272
   in the world of miniatures.  

170
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,988
         when we return,        

171
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,959
        behind the scenes       
  at a hot-air-balloon factory. 

172
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,398
  narrator: did you know that   
  some hot-air-balloon baskets  

173
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,068
 are more than 20 feet long and 
 can carry more than 30 people? 

174
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,470
      this pioneering form      
         of human flight        

175
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,273
     was invented in france     
       in the late 1700s,       

176
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:19,076
 and ever since then, passengers
  have been taking to the skies 

177
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,147
    for an unforgettable ride   
      and an awesome view.      

178
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,353
   it all starts with a little  
    high-tech basket weaving.   

179
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,422
first, the frame is constructed.

180
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,492
       workers cut pieces       
   of stainless-steel tubing.   

181
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,295
       they manually round      
       the corner pieces,       

182
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,365
     then weld all the parts    
            together.           

183
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,171
    a sheet of plywood is cut   
         for the floor.         

184
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,906
 then holes are drilled into it 

185
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,242
       for stainless-steel      
         support cables.        

186
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,711
   these cables will reinforce  
            the floor           

187
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,513
 against the passengers' weight.

188
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:59,383
 after marking off the area that
  the basket walls will occupy, 

189
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,853
     workers run the cables     
        under the floor,        

190
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,254
   which is lying upside down,  

191
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,855
leaving extra cable on both ends

192
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,925
      to come up the sides      
         of the basket.         

193
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,994
    then they notch a groove    

194
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,996
 that is the width of the cables
          and runners.          

195
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,865
 runners are length of ash wood 

196
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:17,468
    that protect the base of    
the basket and give it rigidity.

197
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,807
 after bolting the runners down,
   workers use a branding iron  

198
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,344
    to burn the company logo    
         into the floor.        

199
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,078
     a spray coat of lacquer    

200
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,149
     will prevent moisture      
     from rotting the wood.     

201
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,686
       larger baskets need      
  diagonal reinforcement cables 

202
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,387
       for extra support.       

203
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,158
        the basket walls        
       are made of cane --      

204
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,229
         the stiff stems        
   of a tropical asian plant.   

205
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,332
    the cane soaks overnight    
        in a water tank.        

206
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,902
by morning, it's supple, and the
 weavers can begin their craft. 

207
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:53,037
    they start by installing    
            uprights,           

208
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,307
 attaching each one to the frame
      at the top and bottom     

209
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,842
   with a thin piece of cane.   

210
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,445
   then they feed the support   
      cables from the floor     

211
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,980
      up through the frame.     

212
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,384
the uprights are 18 inches apart
         along the sides        

213
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,187
       and 4 inches apart       
       around the corners.      

214
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,457
    the weavers fill the gaps   
      with thinner uprights     

215
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,526
        every two inches.       

216
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,997
    the uprights are tied to    
 the frame and floor with rope. 

217
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,338
     once they're installed,    

218
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,674
  it's time to build the basket 
    walls from the bottom up    

219
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,878
by interlacing horizontal canes.

220
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,016
  a pair of weavers can finish  
    a small basket in a day.    

221
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,018
    large baskets can require   
         a 4-person team        

222
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,688
   and take up to three weeks   
          to complete.          

223
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,556
  weavers use two techniques -- 

224
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,760
    randing, going in and out   
         with one cane,         

225
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,763
           and waling,          
  weaving three canes at once.  

226
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,998
waling makes a more solid basket

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
             but one            
  that's significantly heavier, 

228
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,637
         because it uses        
   triple the amount of cane.   

229
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,708
some models have stainless-steel
  steps woven into the basket.  

230
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,311
 these give passengers a better 
   foothold when climbing in.   

231
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,514
        the weaving ends        
just below the top of the frame.

232
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,250
   weavers finish off the job   

233
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,886
   by splitting the remainder   
 of each upright down the center

234
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,321
      with a utility knife,     

235
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,624
  then flattening and wrapping  
  what's left around the frame. 

236
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,334
   the weavers integrate rope   
handles at the top of the basket

237
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,403
  so passengers have something  
 to hold on to during the ride. 

238
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,074
  they also put handles at the  
 bottom for carrying the basket.

239
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,814
     now they pad the frame     
           with foam,           

240
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,618
      cutting holes to let      
   the support cables through.  

241
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,286
 the foam provides both comfort 
           and safety,          

242
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,491
 cushioning passengers from the 
 hard metal during a bumpy ride.

243
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:57,361
  after taping the foam pieces  
  together to prevent shifting, 

244
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,032
 workers slip on a leather cover
       and lace it closed.      

245
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,905
    finally, with a few bangs   
         of the hammer,         

246
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,706
 workers expose the short tubing

247
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,909
     to which the load frame    
          will connect.         

248
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,712
   the load frame carries the   
 burners high above the basket. 

249
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,181
         a heating coil         
     surrounds each burner.     

250
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,516
       to make this piece,      

251
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,319
       workers first wrap       
     a stainless-steel tube     

252
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,519
         around a form,         

253
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,189
          then rivet on         
      a reinforcement band.     

254
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,192
       the basket carries       
     lightweight fuel tanks     

255
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,129
 containing cold liquid propane.

256
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,799
    the propane flows upward    
         into the coil.         

257
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,135
     when the pilot fires up    
            a burner,           

258
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,669
    the flame heats the coil,   

259
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,606
transforming the propane flowing
   inside from liquid to gas.   

260
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,876
    the gas feeds the flame,    

261
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,578
       which heats the air      
       inside the balloon.      

262
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,883
       hot air is lighter       
         than cool air,         

263
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,054
 so the balloon literally rises 
        to the occasion.        

264
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,530
  up next, the art of the dart. 

265
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,236
   narrator: the game of darts  
 dates back to the middle ages, 

266
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,704
      when english soldiers     
         looking for fun        

267
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,041
    began pitching arrows at    
 the bottom of an empty barrel. 

268
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,511
 when winter came, the soldiers 
    moved their game indoors,   

269
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,647
        but they couldn't       
 throw big arrows around inside,

270
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,784
so they used shortened versions,
      and the game was on.      

271
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,961
today's darts are finely crafted
        little missiles.        

272
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,000
        production begins       
     with the flight shaft,     

273
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,937
 the piece that the dart's wings
        are attached to.        

274
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,073
   workers load aluminum rods   
 three yards long into a machine

275
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,209
            that has            
   several cutting implements.  

276
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:56,080
 this army of tools works on the
 aluminum rod from all angles...

277
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,816
           shaping it           
     into dozens of shafts.     

278
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,019
         threads are cut        
   into the shaft's exterior,   

279
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,288
       and one of its ends      
         is hollowed out        

280
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,091
      so it can be screwed      
   onto the dart barrel later.  

281
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,448
     a cross saw cuts slots     
       into the other end       

282
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,184
    for attaching the wings.    

283
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,319
 oil flushes away the shavings. 

284
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,055
 it also keeps the tooling cool,

285
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,857
    so it stays sharp enough    
      to cut through metal.     

286
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:49,200
 the completed shafts fall into 
a bin to await further assembly.

287
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,404
   next, brass rods are loaded  
     into a similar machine.    

288
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,207
its tooling carves the brass rod
         into barrels --        

289
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,643
    the main part of the dart   
         that you grip.         

290
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,683
      one end of the barrel     
     is threaded and tapered    

291
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,618
   so the shaft can be screwed  
            onto it.            

292
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,422
    this tapering also makes    
      the dart aerodynamic.     

293
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,559
 next, tools with angled grooves
           cut ridges           

294
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:19,030
  on the outside of the barrel  
to make the dart easier to grip.

295
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,769
 the process is called knurling.

296
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,574
another tool then cuts the brass
  barrel to the correct length. 

297
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,779
   some dart barrels are made   
         from tungsten,         

298
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,483
      which is quite dense,     
 so the barrels can be slimmer. 

299
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,554
   slimmer darts can give you   
          an advantage          

300
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,123
  in tight scoring situations.  

301
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,858
         that's why pros        
   often prefer tungsten darts  

302
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,460
   and have them custom made,   

303
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,363
          even choosing         
    their own knurling grip.    

304
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,938
  these are knurling wheels --  

305
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,609
 another way to etch the grip   
 pattern into the dart barrels. 

306
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,616
     knurling wheels come in    
   an assortment of patterns,   

307
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,818
          all designed          
  to help you keep a firm hold  

308
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,921
  until the dart takes flight.  

309
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:24,629
   now it's time for the darts  
   to get their sharp points.   

310
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,964
        a hydraulic press       
        forces steel tips       

311
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,500
     into the hollowed ends     
      of the dart barrels.      

312
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,310
    with the point now snugly   
         in the barrel,         

313
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,312
the dart is ready for its wings.

314
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,652
      dart wings are made       
      from polyester film,      

315
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,588
        which first winds       
    through printing rollers.   

316
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,590
     some print jobs involve    
      just one basic color      

317
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,195
 while others layer many colors 
      to build up a design.     

318
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,865
     in the world of darts,     
 the wings are known as flights.

319
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,472
       a machine cuts out       
       the flight shapes,       

320
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,409
       and they accumulate      
          in big piles.         

321
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,411
        flights are made        
       in various shapes.       

322
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,013
    this is just one of them.   

323
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,149
    workers fold the cutouts    
   together to make a flight.   

324
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,352
     they check each one for    
            symmetry,           

325
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,754
  because an out-of-proportion  
             flight             

326
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,690
  could wreck a player's game.  

327
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,065
now it's time to screw the shaft
   to the barrel of the dart.   

328
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,703
      the polyester flight      
     slides into cross slots    

329
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,671
    on the end of the shaft.    

330
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,746
    and now this set of darts   
      is ready to take aim.     

331
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,986
   it takes less than a minute  
        to make a dart...       

332
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,857
but less than a second for this 
flying missile to find its mark.
