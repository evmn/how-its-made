00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:43,141
wheel loaders... vegetable oil... hand tools...

4
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,077
vegetable oil... hand tools... and cotton swabs.

5
00:00:52,785 --> 00:01:00,659
they're big, they're bulky, and boy, can they move stuff. wheel loaders are drivable heavy

6
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,426
boy, can they move stuff. wheel loaders are drivable heavy
machines.

7
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,294
wheel loaders are drivable heavy
machines. you see them on construction

8
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,197
machines. you see them on construction sites moving dirt, at landfill

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,265
you see them on construction sites moving dirt, at landfill sites moving garbage, and in the

10
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,201
sites moving dirt, at landfill sites moving garbage, and in the
winter, you see them all over,

11
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,003
sites moving garbage, and in the
winter, you see them all over, clearing large quantities of

winter, you see them all over, clearing large quantities of snow.

13
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,208
clearing large quantities of snow. they start by assembling the

14
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,210

they start by assembling the 100-odd steel components that make up the front frame.

16
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,013
100-odd steel components that make up the front frame. these parts are so heavy that

17
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,448
make up the front frame. these parts are so heavy that workers have to use

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,550
these parts are so heavy that workers have to use industrial-strength magnets to

00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,891
the holes in them. we'll come back to them later. workers measure and mark exactly

24
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,493
we'll come back to them later. workers measure and mark exactly
where they'll weld the front

25
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,195
workers measure and mark exactly
where they'll weld the front frame parts together.

00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,368
now that the front frame is solidly fused, it undergoes a final machining.

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,503
solidly fused, it undergoes a final machining. remember those parts with the

final machining. remember those parts with the holes in them?

51
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,572
remember those parts with the holes in them? they're what enable the boom arm

00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:28,607
when this operation's complete, the front frame will join the other sections at the paint

65
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:32,944
the front frame will join the other sections at the paint shop.

66
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,013
other sections at the paint shop. after painting, workers begin

shop. after painting, workers begin the final assembly.

68
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,650
after painting, workers begin the final assembly. they position an axle under the

00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,799
the axles with heavy-duty bolts.
they mount the diesel engine and
transmission in the rear frame.

75
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:08,247
after assembling the cab, they install it onto the rear frame...

76
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,758
...then connect the wiring for the controls.

77
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,605
now comes the boom arm. remember those front frame parts
with the holes?

78
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,540
remember those front frame parts
with the holes? workers line them up with the

with the holes? workers line them up with the holes on the boom arm, then

80
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,277
workers line them up with the holes on the boom arm, then insert giant steel pins.

81
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,779
holes on the boom arm, then insert giant steel pins. this creates a pivot mechanism,

82
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,215
insert giant steel pins. this creates a pivot mechanism, enabling the arm to move up and

83
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:50,955
this creates a pivot mechanism, enabling the arm to move up and down.

84
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,691
enabling the arm to move up and down. the moving parts must fit

85
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,626
down. the moving parts must fit together snugly, but not so

which explains why welding and machining precision was so

89
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:07,505
which explains why welding and machining precision was so crucial.

90
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,574
machining precision was so crucial. once they've tested the boom

91
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,843
crucial. once they've tested the boom arm's hydraulic lift system...

92
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,179
once they've tested the boom arm's hydraulic lift system... workers install the tires, which

32 bolts in all. the wheel loader is fully assembled.

100
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,734
the wheel loader is fully assembled. now the boom arm can be equipped

101
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,803
assembled. now the boom arm can be equipped
with a forklift, a broom, or a

102
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,506
now the boom arm can be equipped
with a forklift, a broom, or a big shovel called a bucket.

00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,903
the method we're about to see is
called cold pressing. it all starts with seeds -- in

this case, a dark variety of sunflower seeds. cold pressing yields less oil

115
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,643
sunflower seeds. cold pressing yields less oil than other methods, so it's

116
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,512
cold pressing yields less oil than other methods, so it's usually just smaller specialty

00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,294
the pressing mechanism, the screw press, is made up of several sections.

00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,163
screw press, is made up of several sections. they can shorten or lengthen it

145
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,899
several sections. they can shorten or lengthen it according to the type of seeds

146
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,700
they can shorten or lengthen it according to the type of seeds they're pressing to allow for

147
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,569
according to the type of seeds they're pressing to allow for more or less room for the seeds

148
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,438
they're pressing to allow for more or less room for the seeds within the chamber.

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,259
220 pounds of seeds go through the press every hour, producing about 10 gallons of oil...

150
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:48,733
the press every hour, producing about 10 gallons of oil... low volume, but high quality.

151
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,602
about 10 gallons of oil... low volume, but high quality. the seed residue, called seed

00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,273
cakes, is later sold for animal feed. now, though, they're the key to

155
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,875
feed. now, though, they're the key to monitoring temperature.

156
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,043
now, though, they're the key to monitoring temperature. if the seed cakes are too warm,

157
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,145
monitoring temperature. if the seed cakes are too warm, that means heat is building up

158
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,148
if the seed cakes are too warm, that means heat is building up and they have to open the exit

159
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,049
that means heat is building up and they have to open the exit wider to reduce the inside

160
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,617
and they have to open the exit wider to reduce the inside pressure and bring the

161
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:11,222
wider to reduce the inside pressure and bring the temperature down.

162
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,158
pressure and bring the temperature down. once the oil is extracted, they

163
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,026
temperature down. once the oil is extracted, they pump it through a filtration

164
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,862
once the oil is extracted, they pump it through a filtration system.

165
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:41,987
these cloth filters allow the oil to pass through, but any remaining seed residue gets

166
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,889
oil to pass through, but any remaining seed residue gets caught in the fibers.

167
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:58,003
the oil runs through the filters
repeatedly until it becomes clear.

mastering the art of cold pressing takes a lot of know-how
and experience, but it results

169
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,018
pressing takes a lot of know-how
and experience, but it results in oil that's healthier and

170
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,488
and experience, but it results in oil that's healthier and tastier.

171
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,090
in oil that's healthier and tastier. cold-pressed oils made from

172
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,559
tastier. cold-pressed oils made from other seeds pose different

173
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:25,163
cold-pressed oils made from other seeds pose different production challenges.

174
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,864
other seeds pose different production challenges. flaxseed and hempseed are

175
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,900
production challenges. flaxseed and hempseed are extremely sensitive to heat, so

176
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,902
flaxseed and hempseed are extremely sensitive to heat, so workers have to cool the press

life. flaxseed and hempseed oils have to be refrigerated.

197
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,099
flaxseed and hempseed oils have to be refrigerated. even then, they go bad after

even the renovationally challenged are likely to posses a hammer, a screwdriver, maybe

203
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,520
challenged are likely to posses a hammer, a screwdriver, maybe even a pair of pliers -- if not

204
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,321
a hammer, a screwdriver, maybe even a pair of pliers -- if not in a toolbox, then at least

205
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,956
even a pair of pliers -- if not in a toolbox, then at least crammed into a messy drawer

206
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,757
in a toolbox, then at least crammed into a messy drawer somewhere.

207
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,659
crammed into a messy drawer somewhere. here's a look at how some hand

208
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,330
somewhere. here's a look at how some hand tools are made.

209
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,331
here's a look at how some hand tools are made. every screwdriver and chisel has

210
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,466
tools are made. every screwdriver and chisel has
to have a handle.

211
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,434
every screwdriver and chisel has
to have a handle. this factory makes handles from

212
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,338
to have a handle. this factory makes handles from acetate, a synthetic resin.

213
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,473
this factory makes handles from acetate, a synthetic resin. these acetate bars are 6 feet

214
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,875
acetate, a synthetic resin. these acetate bars are 6 feet long and come in many colors and

215
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,677
these acetate bars are 6 feet long and come in many colors and
contours.

216
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,544
long and come in many colors and
contours. they arrive here ready-made.

217
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,313
contours. they arrive here ready-made. workers load the bars onto a

218
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,149
they arrive here ready-made. workers load the bars onto a machine that feeds them into a

219
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,751
workers load the bars onto a machine that feeds them into a lathe.

220
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,853
machine that feeds them into a lathe. as the lathe spins, an automated

221
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,621
lathe. as the lathe spins, an automated
knife cuts one handle after

222
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,690
as the lathe spins, an automated
knife cuts one handle after another, rounding off what will

223
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,961
knife cuts one handle after another, rounding off what will be the top of the handle.

224
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:42,299
another, rounding off what will be the top of the handle. then, it sculpts the other end.

225
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,935
be the top of the handle. then, it sculpts the other end. then, a drill makes the hole

226
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,803
then, it sculpts the other end. then, a drill makes the hole into which they'll later insert

227
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,570
then, a drill makes the hole into which they'll later insert the blade.

228
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,072
into which they'll later insert the blade. all this takes just a few

229
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:55,914
the blade. all this takes just a few seconds.

230
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,049
all this takes just a few seconds. now the handles travel to their

231
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,252
seconds. now the handles travel to their next stop, the dipping machine.

232
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,420
now the handles travel to their next stop, the dipping machine. acetate becomes dull and opaque

233
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,389
next stop, the dipping machine. acetate becomes dull and opaque when it's cut, so the machine

234
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,525
acetate becomes dull and opaque when it's cut, so the machine dips them in acetone, a chemical

235
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,459
when it's cut, so the machine dips them in acetone, a chemical
solvent.

236
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,461
dips them in acetone, a chemical
solvent. this brings back their

237
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,197
solvent. this brings back their translucence and shine.

238
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,365
this brings back their translucence and shine. it also removes any acetate

239
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,233
translucence and shine. it also removes any acetate shavings stuck to the ends.

240
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,136
it also removes any acetate shavings stuck to the ends. here's what the handles look

241
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:25,009
shavings stuck to the ends. here's what the handles look like before the acetone bath.

242
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,777
here's what the handles look like before the acetone bath. and here's what they look like

243
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,613
like before the acetone bath. and here's what they look like after.

244
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:51,836
the handles air-dry on their way
to the next stop on the production line -- printing.

245
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,871
to the next stop on the production line -- printing. the hot-stamp printer works in

246
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,140
production line -- printing. the hot-stamp printer works in conjunction with an ink ribbon.

247
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,243
the hot-stamp printer works in conjunction with an ink ribbon. it applies about 55 pounds of

253
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,355
fahrenheit, transfers the ink from the ribbon into the engraved lettering.

254
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,124
from the ribbon into the engraved lettering. the handles are finished, and

255
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,059
engraved lettering. the handles are finished, and it's finally time to insert the

it's finally time to insert the blades -- in this case, phillips
head screwdriver blades.

258
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,267
blades -- in this case, phillips
head screwdriver blades. blades are made of carbon steel,

259
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,469
head screwdriver blades. blades are made of carbon steel,
an automated machine forces them

260
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,471
blades are made of carbon steel,
an automated machine forces them
into the handle with about 80

261
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,307
an automated machine forces them
into the handle with about 80 pounds of pressure.

262
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,757
workers insert chisel blades manually in order to protect their sharp edge.

263
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,892
manually in order to protect their sharp edge. at the same time, they top the

264
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,027
their sharp edge. at the same time, they top the handle with a steel cap to give

265
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,863
at the same time, they top the handle with a steel cap to give the chisel extra striking power.

266
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,777
another common hand tool is the drywall square, also known as a t-square.

267
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,112
drywall square, also known as a t-square. they cut two strips of aluminum,

268
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,982
t-square. they cut two strips of aluminum,
the first 4 1/2 feet long, the

269
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,651
they cut two strips of aluminum,
the first 4 1/2 feet long, the second 22 inches long.

270
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,787
the first 4 1/2 feet long, the second 22 inches long. then, they apply the markings by

271
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:20,324
second 22 inches long. then, they apply the markings by
silk-screen printing.

272
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,926
then, they apply the markings by
silk-screen printing. next, they use a bending machine

273
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,461
silk-screen printing. next, they use a bending machine
to hold over the top edge of the

274
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,762
next, they use a bending machine
to hold over the top edge of the
piece that will form the

275
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,664
to hold over the top edge of the
piece that will form the horizontal part of the "t."

276
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,866
piece that will form the horizontal part of the "t." this will allow the tool to hook

277
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,734
horizontal part of the "t." this will allow the tool to hook
onto the edge of a drywall

then, guided by weight-detecting
sensors, it produces a uniformly
thick ribbon of cotton called a

344
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,977
sensors, it produces a uniformly
thick ribbon of cotton called a web.

345
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,645
thick ribbon of cotton called a web. this web is now ready to be

this web is now ready to be processed into either cotton swabs or cosmetic pads.

348
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:45,396
to make pads, they layer several
webs -- just how many, though, is a closely guarded company

00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,533
webs -- just how many, though, is a closely guarded company secret.

350
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,469
is a closely guarded company secret. and so is how much pressure they

351
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,070
secret. and so is how much pressure they
apply to those layers to

00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,138
and so is how much pressure they
apply to those layers to compress them.

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,207
apply to those layers to compress them. this secret recipe of layers and

354
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,041
compress them. this secret recipe of layers and
pressure is what ultimately

355
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,877
this secret recipe of layers and
pressure is what ultimately determines the weight of the

00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:00,411
pressure is what ultimately determines the weight of the pad.

357
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,346
determines the weight of the pad. the heavier it is, the higher

358
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,014
pad. the heavier it is, the higher the quality because it's

359
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:11,956
the heavier it is, the higher the quality because it's thicker.

360
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,891
the quality because it's thicker. the now-compressed layers of web

361
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,893
thicker. the now-compressed layers of web
go through a machine called the

362
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,694
the now-compressed layers of web
go through a machine called the slitter.

363
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,862
go through a machine called the slitter. it cuts the wide roll into

364
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,098
slitter. it cuts the wide roll into several narrower rolls called

365
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,934
it cuts the wide roll into several narrower rolls called header rolls.

366
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:37,448
each header roll then goes through a machine that stamps on
a quilt-like pattern, purely for

367
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,183
through a machine that stamps on
a quilt-like pattern, purely for
aesthetics.

368
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:52,864
finally, using a punching die, they cut the pads. on this production run, each pad

369
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,932
they cut the pads. on this production run, each pad
weighs about 2/100 of an ounce,

370
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,767
on this production run, each pad
weighs about 2/100 of an ounce, but the factory can produce

371
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,469
weighs about 2/100 of an ounce, but the factory can produce whatever weight the client

372
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,472
but the factory can produce whatever weight the client requests.

373
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,542
whatever weight the client requests. the cosmetic pads are ready to

the blue light shows the workers
the 100-pad cutoff point. to make cotton swabs, the

380
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:22,560
the 100-pad cutoff point. to make cotton swabs, the initial web is divided into four

381
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,761
to make cotton swabs, the initial web is divided into four
narrower webs, each weighing

382
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,830
initial web is divided into four
narrower webs, each weighing about 5/100 of an ounce per

383
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,899
narrower webs, each weighing about 5/100 of an ounce per yard.

384
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,034
about 5/100 of an ounce per yard. each narrow web travels through

385
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,103
yard. each narrow web travels through a funnel, which transforms its

386
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,205
each narrow web travels through a funnel, which transforms its shape from flat to round.

387
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,709
a funnel, which transforms its shape from flat to round. then, it coils into a barrel.

388
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,511
shape from flat to round. then, it coils into a barrel. the swab-making machine then

389
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,446
then, it coils into a barrel. the swab-making machine then takes cotton strands from two

390
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,248
the swab-making machine then takes cotton strands from two barrels at a time, feeding a

391
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,183
takes cotton strands from two barrels at a time, feeding a line of cotton to each end of

392
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:46,984
barrels at a time, feeding a line of cotton to each end of the stick.

393
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,785
line of cotton to each end of the stick. like the cosmetic pads, the

394
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,454
the stick. like the cosmetic pads, the amount of cotton per stick

395
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,522
like the cosmetic pads, the amount of cotton per stick varies according to the client's

396
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,127
amount of cotton per stick varies according to the client's
specifications.

397
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,028
varies according to the client's
specifications. the stick feeder prepares the

398
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,133
specifications. the stick feeder prepares the sticks.

399
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,034
the stick feeder prepares the sticks. then, as we see here in slow

then, as we see here in slow motion, the machine cuts the cotton strand and rolls a piece

402
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,607
motion, the machine cuts the cotton strand and rolls a piece onto both ends of the stick

403
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,941
cotton strand and rolls a piece onto both ends of the stick simultaneously.

simultaneously. just prior, a heating device melted the tips of the plastic

406
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,147
just prior, a heating device melted the tips of the plastic sticks so the cotton would

407
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,015
melted the tips of the plastic sticks so the cotton would adhere.

408

sticks so the cotton would adhere. with wood or cardboard sticks,

409
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,253
adhere. with wood or cardboard sticks, they glue the cotton on.

410
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,489
with wood or cardboard sticks, they glue the cotton on. the finished swabs are sprayed

411
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,825
they glue the cotton on. the finished swabs are sprayed with an antibacterial solution.

sensors detect any defective

417
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,407
swabs and automatically toss

418
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,242
them off the production line.

419
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,044
if you look closely, every so

420
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:50,747
often, you'll see one missing.

421
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,850
finally, a robotic arm grabs the

422
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,986
exact number of swabs per box,

423
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,654
again determined by the

424
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,723
customer's specs, and packages

425
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,490
them.

426
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,259
the company's lab does spot

427
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,194
checks on its swabs to ensure

428
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,196
that the antibacterial solution

429
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,331
is working...

430
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,133
and that the products are

431
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,001
germfree.
