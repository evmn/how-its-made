the tube has already been       

597
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,100
equipped with a secondary mirror

598
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,501
that will bounce reflected      

599
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,335
images from the primary mirror  

600
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,171
back for magnification and      

601
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,072
viewing.                        

602
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,441
it's taken about six weeks      

603
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,742
to build this telescope.        

604
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,110
and now it's ready to help      

605
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,812
unravel the mysteries of        

606
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,615
the universe.                   

607
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,861
if you have any comments about  

608
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,595
the show or if you'd like to    

609
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,397
suggest topics for future shows,
