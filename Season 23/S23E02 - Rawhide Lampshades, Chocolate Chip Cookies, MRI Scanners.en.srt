narrator: you doesn't need to have antlers over the fireplace            

4
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,058
to bring a touch of wildlife to your decor.          

5
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,325
a more subtle approach      

6
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,795
can be a lamp with a shade made of rawhide.  

7
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,464
rawhide is untanned animal skin.              

8
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,466
the hide typically comes from livestock,      

9
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,603
so you get the decorative "bang" without firing a shot.      

10
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,077
you typically see rawhide    
lampshades in rustic settings,  

11
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,279
but they've also been known to add an eclectic twist     

12
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,681
to a modern decor.        

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,950
this company has been using the same techniques    

14
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:29,021
to hand-craft rawhide lampshades since 1929.           

15
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,690
the first step is to construct the shade's frame        

16
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,593
out of 3-millimeter-thick steel wire.           

17
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,630
they begin by cutting the various lengths of wire   

18
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:43,035
to make the component's first shade of a particular size.   

19
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,371
every frame has one top ring, one bottom ring,         

20
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,674
and several vertical ribs connecting the two.       

21
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:57,849
after clamping the wires alongside a measuring gauge,   

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,121
they position the blade where required and cut.     

23
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,660
they curve the pieces for the rings          

24
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,728
with crank-operated rollers,   

25
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,399
which apply pressure to bend the wire.        

26
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,068
it takes a few passes to work the steel wire      

27
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,136
into a full circle.       

28
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,144
then they spot-weld the ends together to complete each ring.              

29
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,785
they cool the hot weld in cold water.          

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,624
now it's time to assemble the frame.      

31
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:42,628
they use a jig to correctly position all the parts.     

32
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,566
this one is for a slanted shade with an 18-inch bottom diameter.            

33
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,502
after laying in the bottom ring,              

34
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:55,107
they position one rib at a time and spot-weld it to the ring.  

35
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,457
they assemble the spider --   

36
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,126
the inner structure of the top ring.         

37
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,929
they take a brass washer with four holes in it      

38
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,699
and insert a steel wire arm into each one.          

39
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:28,908
a single strike of a 1-ton press locks each arm in the washer.  

40
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,946
they spot-weld the spider to the top ring...        

41
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,421
...then the ring to each rib of the frame.    

42
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,763
the frame is now fully constructed        

43
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:53,632
and ready to be coated with baked-on paint.       

44
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,034
this not only makes the frame more attractive,    

45
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,636
it prevents the steel      

46
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,973
from rusting as it comes in contact with the wet rawhide.            

47
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,976
the freshly-washed sheepskin   

48
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,378
is the highest grade of hide available,            

49
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,246
so the color is an even butterscotch --    

50
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,384
rarely any color variations or spots.            

51
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,987
they center the frame upside-down on the skin,     

52
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,922
then work their way around,   

53
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,258
folding the skin upward and over,         

54
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,294
clamping it in place with clothespins.        

55
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,463
then, they flip the shade right side up     

56
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,266
and slit the skin at the top with a razor blade        

57
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,100
to release some tension.     

58
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:34,073
now they sew the skin to the top and bottom of the frame     

59
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,674
with rawhide lace.        

60
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,843
however, this rawhide is cow skin.           

61
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,786
once the sewing is complete, they cut off the excess skin.  

62
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,497
the rawhide is still quite wet, so they dry the lampshade    

63
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,034
in a heated closet for about five hours.      

64
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,505
when it comes out,        

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,376
they bathe the rawhide in a moisturizing agent     

66
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,178
then a finishing solution,    

67
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,582
the specifics of which are a closely-guarded company secret.             

68
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,318
these treatments bring out the butterscotch color      

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,322
and seal the hide to prevent it from drying out and cracking.  

70
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,791
the lampshade then goes back into the heated closet      

71
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,059
for 24 hours.          

72
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:32,664
lampshades are often hands-painted before this,    

73
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,135
in which case the finishing solution seals the oil paint   

74
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,603
as well as the hide.       

75
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:44,677
each design is original and signed by the artist --   

76
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,646
a unique work of art designed to light up a room.   

77
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,232
narrator: legend has it that chocolate-chip cookies   

78
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,967
were invented in 1930      

79
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,836
by an american innkeeper who ran out of baker's chocolate.  

80
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,840
she improved by breaking a semi-sweet chocolate bar    

81
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,442
into small pieces.        

82
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:19,244
instead of melting,       
the chocolate merely softened,  

83
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,147
dotting the cookie with chocolate chips.      

84
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,517
they look homemade,       

85
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,986
and they taste homemade,     

86
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,587
but this home is a factory.   

87
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,791
each ingredient goes      
into an industrial-size mixer,  

88
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,327
starting with white sugar.    

89
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,729
then brown sugar.        

90
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,699
then butter.           

91
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:49,208
the mixer thoroughly blends these first ingredients     

92
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,010
until the butter becomes soft and creamy     

93
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,280
and the sugars are evenly dispersed.      

94
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:58,217
then it's time for the headliner --       

95
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:00,018
chocolate chips.         

96
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,353
they're semi-sweet,       

97
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,722
which is a mixture       
of bitter and sweet chocolate.  

98
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,294
next, flour,           

99
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,964
followed by baking soda to make the dough rise      

100
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,502
and salt to add flavor.     

101
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:19,838
the final ingredients are whole eggs, beaten,     

102
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,306
combined with vanilla,      

103
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,043
made from beans harvested in madagascar, africa.      

104
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,380
mixing resume until everything's well-blended,          

105
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,316
which usually takes about five minutes.    

106
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,185
the company closely guards recipe specifics,           

107
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,521
but if you're curious,      

108
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,655
you could probably figure them out         

109
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,459
by multiplying the ingredients of a home recipe         

110
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,195
to the yield of a production batch.      

111
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,730
workers transfer the cookie dough         

112
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,865
to a machine called the former.             

113
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,468
it pushes the dough through round dies,       

114
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,803
producing row upon row      

115
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,540
of round pieces weighing 1.4 ounces each,         

116
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:58,343
one of several sizes the factory produces.      

117
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,346
the factory then flash-freezes the dough rounds         

118
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,815
for sale to food-service customers            

119
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,484
such as restaurants and hotels,             

120
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,353
which bake the cookies in their own kitchens.      

121
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,422
the freeze tunnel uses liquid nitrogen       

122
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,958
to create the frigid temperature.     

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,159
the passing dough rounds     

124
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,230
solidify in approximately five minutes.          

125
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,832
exiting the freeze tunnel,    

126
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,835
the dough rounds pass under a metal detector   

127
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,970
to ensure they don't contain any metal particles.       

128
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:30,175
this safety measure is standard            
practice in the food industry.  

129
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,578
the packaging system is entirely automated.      

130
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,914
the first station erects the box.         

131
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:40,152
the second station lines it with plastic.         

132
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,925
a conveyer belt, meanwhile,   

133
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:51,530
feeds the frozen, unbaked    
cookies onto automated scales.  

134
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,265
once a scale hits the per-box weight,     

135
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,600
feeding pauses.         

136
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,069
the bottom swings open,     

137
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,271
and the cookies drop into the box        

138
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,839
awaiting directly underneath.  

139
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,412
the next stations seal and label the boxes,       

140
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,148
which workers then load onto pallets.          

141
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,350
the pallets go into a storage freezer,     

142
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,885
where they stay until it's time              

143
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,156
to ship them out, by freezer truck, to the customer.     

144
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,560
this company also sells gift tins of cookies online      

145
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,562
and by catalog.         

146
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,165
for that market, they bake the cookies in-house.            

147
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,835
workers lay out the dough rounds             

148
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:34,038
2 inches apart on trays lined with parchment paper.   

149
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,174
this prevents sticking, making it easy          

150
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,377
to remove the baked cookies without breaking them.      

151
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:45,918
the dough rounds are nearly 1 inches wide by 1 inch high.   

152
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,354
as they bake, they flatten out and double in diameter.     

153
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,192
the trays remain in the oven for seven minutes        

154
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,828
at 300 degrees fahrenheit.    

155
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,799
a turntable inside rotates them              

156
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,870
so that the cookies bake evenly throughout the tray.   

157
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,207
a few cookies per batch go   
to the quality control tester,  

158
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,741
who, unfortunately,       

159
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,476
doesn't get to conduct the assessment          

160
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,478
by eating the samples.      

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,481
rather, the tester measures the diameter and height             

162
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,284
to ensure consistency in size and chip content.    

163
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,756
in the online and catalogue order assembly area,       

164
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,293
workers line the bottom part of the gift tin         

165
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,229
with a decorative cellophane bag.         

166
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,365
then, they carefully layer the correct number        

167
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:37,302
of fresh cookies inside in a staggered configuration.  

168
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,905
this not only creates a nice presentation,       

169
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,441
it also prevents damage in transit.           

170
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,911
they close the bag with a gold twist tie      

171
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,012
to seal in the freshness...   

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,049
...close up the tin,       

173
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,518
then pack it for shipping.    

174
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,055
this is how to give a gift of homemade chocolate chip cookies             

175
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,258
without ever setting foot in the kitchen.         

176
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,343
narrator: the mri scanner was invented in 1977,      

177
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,413
and it has revolutionized medical diagnostics.       

178
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,949
short for magnetic resonance imaging,            

179
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,685
an mri offers an inside look at the human body        

180
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,021
without surgery or x-rays.    

181
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,955
when investigation health problems,            

182
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,958
it's a great way to get the picture.       

183
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,031
using magnetic fields and radio-wave pulses,      

184
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,234
an mri can look right through you        

185
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:47,105
to determine what's going on under the skin.         

186
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,708
the magnet is incredibly powerful.     

187
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,545
it's up to 30,000 times stronger than the earth's magnetic field.             

188
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,117
to make an mri scanner,     

189
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,920
they weld aluminum casing around the magnet,        

190
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,922
creating a tunnel        
in the center for the patient.  

191
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,192
the seams must be extremely tight         

192
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,395
because the tube will also contain        

193
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,330
the super-cold liquid helium          

194
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,700
which will make the magnet so incredibly powerful.     

195
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,737
once the welds are complete,   

196
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,140
they cap the magnet and transfer it to a test chamber.      

197
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,279
they pump helium gas into the tube          

198
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,815
and activate a vacuum system that sucks out the air      

199
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,683
in the chamber.         

200
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,352
a sensor confirms there are no leaks        

201
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,954
and the welds are tight.     

202
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:44,029
they now construct a second aluminum tube around the magnet.             

203
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,931
this will act as an insulating shield.     

204
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,238
they wrap and aluminized mylar blanket   

205
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,708
tightly around the magnet.    

206
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,043
aluminized mylar         

207
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,045
was first developed as an insulating material    

208
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,913
for space suits.         

209
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,850
in this case, it will be used to deflect heat         

210
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,151
to keep the magnet cold.     

211
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,258
they now insert the magnet into a steel shell.       

212
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,660
this is know as the vacuum vessel.      

213
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,262
the air will be pulled from the space      

214
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,197
between it and the magnet,    

215
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,900
creating a vacuum which will serve as another insulator.   

216
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,344
they mask the mri tunnel with plastic           

217
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:36,414
and spray paint the exterior white.       

218
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,216
the paint will protect the steel from rust.            

219
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,688
next, they install a refrigeration unit       

220
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,923
knows as the cold head.     

221
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,761
the cold head will maintain the helium     

222
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,030
around the mri's primary magnet             

223
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,433
at the incredibly chilly temperature           

224
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,436
of -452 degrees fahrenheit.   

225
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,705
this will keep the helium in a liquid state.        

226
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,107
without the cold head,      

227
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,743
significant amounts would vaporize and be lost.   

228
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,449
they now pump the liquid helium into the magnet.         

229
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,918
it's one of the coldest things on the planet,          

230
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,654
and the fill nozzles turn frosty.           

231
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,525
exposed to this extreme cold,  

232
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,328
the magnet loses all electrical resistance           

233
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,330
and becomes a super conductor,  

234
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,799
generating intense magnetic fields.         

235
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,203
with the mri magnet complete,  

236
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,406
they move on to the gradient coil,      

237
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,607
which will control the orientation of the image   

238
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,010
with electrical pulses.     

239
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,279
it starts with a fiberglass epoxy tube            

240
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,748
cut to the correct length.    

241
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,018
a worker carves grooves in the tube           

242
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,954
and fills those grooves with epoxy.           

243
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:57,762
he then winds copper wire    
into the epoxy-filled grooves,  

244
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,499
and it adheres, forming the gradient coil.    

245
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,908
the team slathers epoxy onto the entire tube.   

246
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,910
the epoxy seals the wire,    

247
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,580
preventing vibrations of the coil when it's in operation.           

248
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,787
they layer etched copper plates onto the epoxy,         

249
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,055
and they adhere.         

250
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,965
they wrap the coil tightly with teflon cloth.    

251
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,506
a worker pours epoxy resin onto the fabric.         

252
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,545
he then winds tubing around the gradient coil,    

253
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,881
which adheres to the epoxy-coated cloth.    

254
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,549
these are cooling lines.     

255
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,352
they'll disperse heat generated by the gradient coil.      

256
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,091
another worker now preps the next fiberglass tube.    

257
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:05,163
this one is for the mri's radio-frequency coil.      

258
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,899
there's much more to come before this mri scanner     

259
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:11,569
is ready to provide an inside look at the human body,     

260
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,572
so stay tuned.          

261
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,852
narrator: an mri scanner          

262
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,587
produces detailed images of bones, organs,        

263
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,456
and other structures inside the human body.      

264
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,660
it does this by generating a strong magnetic field     

265
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,530
that causes the body's hydrogen atoms to align          

266
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,065
and send a signal.        

267
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,767
the result is a picture that could lead to a diagnosis.           

268
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,274
work on the mri's radio-frequency coil       

269
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,475
is under way.          

270
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,810
a technician attaches plastic risers          

271
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,681
and pads to the fiberglass core.              

272
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,149
the risers and pads       

273
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,486
will hold the circuitry parts at a uniform level.       

274
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,556
she applies adhesive-backed strips of copper             

275
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,425
from one band of risers to the other.          

276
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,028
these copper strips are the antenna.         

277
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,430
they'll send and receive signals from the body          

278
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:16,268
and relay them to a computer to produce the mri image.    

279
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,842
she presses the copper with round-tipped tool      

280
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,544
for better adhesion to the core.              

281
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,149
she then dabs epoxy glue into the riser compartments.   

282
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:40,325
she inserts capacitors into the glue-filled compartments.  

283
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,261
these little capacitors will store energy        

284
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,364
and change the frequency of   
the coil to match the magnets.  

285
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,136
the technician solders the ends of the capacitors        

286
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,073
to the copper antenna as she builds the circuitry.   

287
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,414
she transfers numerous high-voltage inductor boards   

288
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,216
to the pads and screws them in place.    

289
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,694
next up are cable-splitter units.              

290
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,663
another technician installs one near an inductor board.     

291
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,635
she routes some of the cables from the splitter        

292
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,337
to the several of the inductors.           

293
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,179
and she solders the cables to the inductors.        

294
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,588
she places a plastic cable track              

295
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,924
on the side of the radio-frequency coil   

296
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,126
and snakes the main power cable through it.           

297
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,599
she solders the cable to the antenna.         

298
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,407
the technician stiffens the copper antenna   

299
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,809
with composite boards      

300
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,779
to dampen vibrations when the mri is in operation.  

301
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,885
she applies epoxy around all the cables.      

302
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,755
the epoxy secures the cables   

303
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,357
to keep them from moving around and making noise.     

304
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,695
the mri's radio-frequency coil  

305
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,732
is complete and ready to be put to the test.      

306
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,835
the next worker caps the ends with metal domes         

307
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,370
and bolts them tightly together.            

308
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,375
she pumps highly pressurized air               

309
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,444
into the capped radio-frequency coil.              

310
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,118
she spray soapy water over the exterior of the coil  

311
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,987
and looks for air bubbles.    

312
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,257
bubbles in the soapy residue would indicate a leak,      

313
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,594
which would disrupt airflow in the mri.           

314
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,664
with the radio-frequency coil leak-free,         

315
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,733
they now slide it into the gradient coil,     

316
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,668
which has gained an outer fiberglass shell    

317
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,071
since we last saw it.      

318
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,745
the worker connects exterior tubing     

319
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:16,881
to the network of cooling lines inside the gradient coil.    

320
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,486
with those connections made,   

321
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,422
they're ready to assemble the coils to the magnet.     

322
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,090
the worker slides the assembly  

323
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:30,228
off the cart and into the mri magnet.     

324
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,964
he installs a bracket that centers the coils,     

325
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:37,702
maintaining a small gap between them and the magnet.   

326
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,905
he equips the mri        
with microphones and speakers,  

327
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,708
to communicate with the patient.            

328
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,044
there's also a signaling system here for the patient to activate            

329
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,613
in the event of an emergency.         

330
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,221
now for the ultimate test.    

331
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,588
they energize the magnet     

332
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,592
and send standard test objects into the mri.          

333
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:03,995
they scan the objects      

334
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,497
and confirm the picture is clear.      

335
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:12,003
they add a metal and plastic outer casing.    

336
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,406
this mri scanner is now ready to focus on diagnosis.      

337
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,645
the next picture it takes could be a life saver.      

338
