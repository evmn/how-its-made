    discovery communications

00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,319
     narrator: in the world     
     of temperature-gauging,    

4
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,656
      the dial thermometer      
     is a lot easier to read    

5
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:58,791
 than a glass-stem thermometer. 

6
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,928
 a needle points to bold numbers
           on a dial,           

7
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,261
    and even from a distance,   

8
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,597
  it only takes a quick glance  

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,001
to confirm an initial impression
   that things are heating up.  

10
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,740
     all the highs and lows     
        are plain to see        

11
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,542
           on the face          
     of a dial thermometer.     

12
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,344
         it often comes         
       with lengthy tubing      

13
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,212
     to measure temperature     
           from afar.           

14
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,481
      it's a handy feature      
        for power plants        

15
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,817
  and heating and refrigeration 
            systems.            

16
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,153
  to begin, rollers straighten  
    very narrow metal tubing.   

17
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:32,158
 then a blade cuts it to length 
 depending on the application.  

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,363
   as the blade makes the cut,  
a mechanism pries open the ends.

19
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:41,166
next, a worker inserts a fitting
     into a much wider tube     

20
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,170
        that will become        
 the thermometer's sensor bulb. 

21
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,038
he secures the tube in a fixture

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,574
   and welds the narrow tubing  
        machined earlier        

23
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,177
         to the fitting         
     on the end of the bulb.    

24
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,646
          with the bulb         
     and tubing now linked,     

25
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,448
        production moves        
       to the next stage,       

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,518
 the making of the burden tube, 
  which is a kind of a spring.  

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,056
 a worker cuts flat, wafer-thin 
        tubing to length.       

28
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,391
         down the line,         

29
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:09,662
    they clamp the flat tubes   
 in a device that's on a track. 

30
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,931
   it moves past an arc welder  

31
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,301
  that melts and closes one end 
       of the flat tubes.       

32
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,140
    here's a before-and-after   
           comparison.          

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,477
 a worker now encloses the tube 
            in a die            

34
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,380
        and drives a pin        
       into its open end.       

35
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,818
           this widens          
    and redefines the opening   

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,787
    from inside and outside.    

37
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,222
  he slides it over another pin 

38
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,092
          and activates         
    a mechanical punch press.   

39
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:44,030
    this fine-tunes the shape   
 and dimensions of the opening. 

40
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,434
 the next worker clamps the tube
       in another device.       

41
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:52,838
 he operates a roller to wrap it
       around a mandrill,       

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,441
  bending it into a "c" shape.  

43
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:01,514
this completes the thermometer's
       burden-tube spring.      

44
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:03,716
the next worker clamps a bracket

45
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:07,186
          to the bottom         
       of the burden tube.      

46
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,922
    he inserts a small piece    
       of connector tubing      

47
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,457
     in the burden-tube hole    

48
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,260
   and applies liberal amounts  
       of a flux compound.      

49
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,662
  the flux prevents tarnishing  
          of the metal          

50
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,665
    as he melts silver solder   
  to braise the parts together  

51
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,801
    and to seal the opening.    

52
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,535
           now a test.          

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,672
          he pumps gas          
    into several burden tubes   

54
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,340
   and immerses them in water.  

55
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,742
      if no gas bubbles out     
          of the tubes,         

56
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,812
       it means the tubes       
      are perfectly sealed.     

57
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:38,017
  the gas pressure also causes  
the tubes to spring into action.

58
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,885
        it's this action        
   that will move the pointer   

59
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,622
           on the dial          
       of the thermometer.      

60
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,693
    the next worker attaches    
a brass connector to the tubing.

61
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:54,567
    he braises them together    
    to create a solid bond.     

62
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,703
 he folds the braised parts into
  the curve of the burden tube  

63
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,306
    and pushes it into place    
    with a mechanical press.    

64
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,908
  he installs the gear assembly 

65
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,977
 that will translate the linear 
   movement of the burden tube  

66
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,714
  into the rotational movement  
  of the thermometer pointer.   

67
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,917
            he screws           
    the dual-temperature dial   

68
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,919
  to the burden-tube assembly.  

69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,921
 the more detailed and extensive
           the scale,           

70
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,057
      the bigger the dial.      

71
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,259
     this one is mid-sized.     

72
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,728
       and now everything       
         comes together         

73
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,332
 as he tethers the sensing bulb,
  along with a short fill tube, 

74
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,535
         to the back of         
    the burden-tube assembly.   

75
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,470
     using a braising torch     
           and solder,          

76
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,606
    he seals the connection.    

77
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,610
      he then steam-cleans      
       the braised joint.       

78
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,813
       he buries the bulb       
       in a hot sand bath       

79
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,283
    that causes any moisture    
       in it to evaporate.      

80
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,084
     through the fill tube,     

81
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,353
       he fills the bulb        
       with nitrogen gas.       

82
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,489
  to calibrate the thermometer, 

83
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,558
   he plunges the sensing bulb  
        in boiling water        

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,826
    and adjusts the pressure    
       of the nitrogen gas      

85
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,364
         until the dial         
  reads 212 degrees fahrenheit. 

86
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:02,300
the fill tube's job is now done,
so he crimps it to seal it off. 

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,571
      he tests its accuracy     
  by immersing the sensing bulb 

88
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,506
  in numerous controlled baths, 

89
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,507
            each one            
    a different temperature.    

90
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,043
    and if it's on the mark,    

91
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,914
 he encloses the inner workings 
  in the stainless-steel case.  

92
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:19,919
      he protects the joint     
 with a special metal spring... 

93
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,521
    and snaps a clear window    
          to the case.          

94
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:26,458
      a gasket between them     
    ensures a dustproof seal.   

95
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,129
 he screws a part called a well 
 to the sensing-bulb connector. 

96
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,200
    the well will protect it    
  in high-pressure situations.  

97
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:37,202
    and this dial thermometer   
          is now ready          

98
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,573
      for the ups and downs     
     of temperature-gauging.    

99
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,089
       narrator: hummus is      
    the original snack food.    

100
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,158
     people have been eating    
        this chickpea dip       

101
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,492
     for thousands of years.    

102
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,362
countries from the mediterranean
       to the middle east       

103
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,963
   lay claim to its invention.  

104
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,366
          but one thing         
      is beyond dispute --      

105
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,937
 as an appetizer or side dish,  
 hummus has real staying power. 

106
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,444
   hummus is a vegetarian form  
           of protein,          

107
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:20,379
       which could be why       
      more and more people      

108
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,748
   are choosing to take a dip.  

109
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,987
  the word "hummus" is actually 
     arabic for "chickpea,"     

110
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:31,390
       which is of course       
      the main ingredient.      

111
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:34,226
      the chickpeas arrive      
  at the factory in dried form. 

112
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,063
   they ride a conveyor upward  

113
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,266
       and then spill down      
  onto a long, vibrating tray.  

114
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,202
          it shakes out         
      heavier contaminants      

115
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:44,603
     like pebbles or twigs.     

116
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,139
        the contaminants        
     fall into a bin below,     

117
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,541
       while the chickpeas      
       bounce off the tray      

118
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,511
and into a tub of filtered water
          to be rinsed.         

119
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,082
       still dripping wet,      

120
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,685
      it's onto a conveyor      
    with perforated buckets.    

121
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,087
        the water drains        
       from the chickpeas       

122
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,590
     as they're transferred     
          to big tanks.         

123
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,761
    each tank holds thousands   
      of little chickpeas.      

124
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,366
      they add clean water      
     and soak the chickpeas.    

125
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:17,169
   after 14 hours in the tank,  

126
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,272
 they swell to twice their size 
         and soften up.         

127
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:27,179
they pump the softened chickpeas
         into big trays,        

128
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,983
   which they stack on a cart.  

129
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,919
     then it's into a huge,     
    cylindrical steam cooker    

130
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:38,390
 that's been preheated to around
     255 degrees fahrenheit.    

131
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,862
     they bake the chickpeas    
   for just over half an hour.  

132
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:47,766
   this softens them even more  
     and darkens the color.     

133
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,872
        from dried beans        
   to soaked and then cooked.   

134
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:59,411
  they now transfer the cooked  
 chickpeas to the next conveyor,

135
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,448
    and they're on their way    
   to being ground to a pulp.   

136
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,683
      this is the grinder,      

137
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,353
      now being reassembled     
         after cleaning.        

138
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,089
    it has two sharp-toothed,   
        circular blades.        

139
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,892
       one is stationary,       
     and the other revolves.    

140
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,829
        a big turn screw        
    will force the chickpeas    

141
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,365
  through these toothed blades  
        to grind them up.       

142
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,439
   a quick test confirms this   
  grinder is in working order.  

143
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,844
    meanwhile, the chickpeas    
    have arrived at a hopper    

144
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,813
       above the grinder.       

145
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,519
        as the chickpeas        
     spill into the hopper,     

146
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,790
   they add water and a blend   
   of sunflower and olive oil,  

147
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:48,460
   followed by salt, garlic,    
   and other dry ingredients.   

148
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,795
          the chickpeas         
      and other ingredients     

149
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,132
            flow into           
    the grinding device below   

150
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,467
  and are turned into a paste.  

151
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,874
 the next ingredient is tahini. 

152
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,944
       it's a thick paste       
 made from ground sesame seeds. 

153
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,214
      three powerful pumps      
      pulverize the tahini      

154
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,283
to evenly disperse the particles

155
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,486
    so it can now be blended    
     with the chickpea mix.     

156
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,763
    big, steel blades revolve   
        to thoroughly mix       

157
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,500
  all the ingredients in a tank 
       and produce hummus.      

158
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,102
 for different-flavored hummus, 

159
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,170
      they add red pepper,      
          more garlic,          

160
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,107
      or other ingredients.     

161
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,776
    after the blended product   
         is pasteurized,        

162
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,646
   a technician takes samples   
        for lab testing,        

163
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,182
      for mold, shelf life,     
        and other tests.        

164
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,450
      she also does her own     
           taste test.          

165
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,986
          if the flavor         
    seems even slightly off,    

166
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,323
 they'll put the product on hold
   and tweak the ingredients.   

167
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,593
  but this batch gets the nod.  

168
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,463
  meanwhile, plastic containers 
   are queuing for a fill-up.   

169
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:02,000
  machinery moves them forward  
     toward piston fillers.     

170
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,335
   the pistons push the creamy  
      hummus out of nozzles     

171
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,672
       and into the tubs.       

172
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,676
     now filled to the brim     
          with hummus,          

173
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:14,813
  the tubs travel under a sheet 
        of plastic film.        

174
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,948
        hot, round irons        
        melt the plastic        

175
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,416
     to seal it to the rims.    

176
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,687
  suctioning devices swoop down 
       to apply the lids,       

177
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,088
         and the hummus         
      heads towards a roll      

178
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,959
   of adhesive-backed labels.   

179
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,961
  a sensor detects the approach 
           of the tubs          

180
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,030
      and triggers a device     
      with little air jets      

181
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,665
 to slap the labels on the lids.

182
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:40,439
 this hummus production has gone
      very smoothly indeed.     

183
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,592
 narrator: spent fuel containers
 are designed to take the heat, 

184
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,862
   the kind caused by the most  
     radioactive of waste --    

185
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,397
       used nuclear fuel.       

186
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,933
         these fuel rods        
        are too dangerous       

187
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,735
   to be casually disposed of,  

188
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,671
     but encased in special     
     spent fuel cannisters,     

189
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,274
  the risk should be contained. 

190
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,212
          nuclear waste         
   sits in a holding pattern,   

191
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,948
    and that means storing it   
      in massive cylinders      

192
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,417
       until there's a way      
        to dispose of it.       

193
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,818
     these containers start     

194
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,154
  with a big, rectangular sheet 
       of stainless steel.      

195
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:34,560
    a special circular cutter   
 carves a beveled edge onto it. 

196
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,094
     they feed it to rollers    

197
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,429
      which curl the sheet      
        into a cylinder.        

198
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,099
       it takes four trips      
       through the rollers      

199
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,369
     to really round it out.    

200
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,840
   they tuck a template inside  
 the curve to check the radius. 

201
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,112
      next, a welder joins      
    the neatly beveled edges    

202
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,647
    to complete the cylinder.   

203
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,984
      this cylinder will be     
 the outer wall of a cannister. 

204
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,252
     the cannister will fit     
     inside a big cylinder      

205
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,921
       called an overpack.      

206
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,724
         its outer shell        
 is just under an inch thick -- 

207
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,126
about the diameter of a quarter.

208
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,329
         as you can see,        
      building a container      

209
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,865
   to hold used nuclear fuel    
   is a many-layered process.   

210
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:17,669
 the next step involves the lid,
  made of multiple steel disks  

211
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,937
      with concrete placed      
    between the steel layers    

212
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,807
        like a sandwich.        

213
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,810
           incredibly,          
    high-pressure water jets    

214
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,280
  easily cut through the thick  
  steel to produce the disks.   

215
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,949
       a computerized tool      
      cuts a groove profile     

216
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,552
  along the edge of each disk.  

217
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,155
        they also machine       
      the top of each disk      

218
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,556
     to the correct profile     

219
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,027
   and then measure to confirm  
       it's exactly right.      

220
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,364
   next, a computerized laser   

221
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,632
       slices through more      
     stainless-steel plating    

222
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,435
 to produce long, narrow panels.

223
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,236
each is designed to fit together

224
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:56,508
   to create a grid of storage  
   cells inside the cannister.  

225
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,581
      they line each panel      
     with an aluminum alloy     

226
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,183
    that's neutron-absorbent,   

227
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,920
    and they place a piece of   
 steel sheeting on top of that. 

228
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,723
  they weld the steel sheeting  
       to the steel panel,      

229
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,860
 encasing the neutron-absorbent 
            material.           

230
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,865
working within a metal framework
          for guidance,         

231
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,467
   they weld four of the lined  
      steel panels together     

232
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,069
   to create a fuel-cell grid   

233
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,339
          for one used          
      nuclear fuel bundle.      

234
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,143
 they then build a 68-cell grid.

235
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:34,145
       with that complete,      
 they're ready to piece together

236
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,884
          all the parts         
  of the spent fuel cannister.  

237
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:43,555
they first lower the inner shell
      onto the base plate.      

238
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,560
    the shell is held steady    
    by a supportive structure   

239
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,962
    as they weld it together    
          at the seams.         

240
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,433
         moving inside,         

241
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:59,171
   they install numerous bars   
 to support the fuel-cell grid. 

242
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,909
 with the cannister now wrapped 
  in plastic to keep it clean,  

243
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,779
       an automated cutter      
  gradually shaves down the rim 

244
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,914
           to trim it           
     to the correct height.     

245
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,385
    precision is everything.    

246
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,387
   using a level and a laser,   

247
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:19,358
  they ensure that the trim job 
       is even and exact.       

248
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,260
     once they're satisfied,    

249
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,595
         a crane carries        
     the fuel-cell assembly     

250
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,063
      over to the cannister     

251
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,202
      and then suspends it      
     above the open cavity.     

252
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,275
  it dangles briefly as workers 
      inspect the assembly.     

253
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,411
   they give it the thumbs-up,  

254
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,013
    and the crane then lowers   
        the fuel assembly       

255
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,082
       into the cylinder.       

256
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,817
        it's a snug fit,        

257
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,953
   with about 4/10 of an inch   
          of clearance          

258
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,456
   between the inner assembly   
  and the wall of the cylinder. 

259
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,762
this technician inserts a camera
   into each cell of the grid   

260
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,699
   and scrutinizes the image.   

261
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,503
   he's looking for any debris  

262
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,571
        that could hamper       
        the installation        

263
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,173
  of the nuclear fuel bundles.  

264
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,442
       both the cylinder        
       and the fuel cells       

265
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,110
 have been meticulously cleaned,

266
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,645
    but the camera inspection   

267
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:17,515
      confirms they haven't     
        missed anything.        

268
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:21,186
    so it's time to put a lid   
on this nuclear-waste cannister.

269
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,720
        it's a trial fit.       

270
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,390
   the lid will be permanently  
  welded to the cannister later 

271
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:30,061
     once the used fuel rods    
       are safely inside.       

272
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,331
   the cannister will then be   
   placed inside the overpack,  

273
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,068
      with concrete poured      
       between the walls.       

274
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,871
  that should keep the hazards  
        of nuclear waste        

275
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,474
     entombed indefinitely.     

276
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,826
            narrator:           
 the word "sombrero" is derived 

277
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,695
   from the spanish "sombra,"   
      which means "shade."      

278
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,165
       the expansive brim       
      of these mexican hats     

279
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,234
       is designed to cast      
          a wide shadow         

280
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,836
      over the face, neck,      
         and shoulders.         

281
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,372
        fancier sombreros       
        are made of felt.       

282
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,509
     regular ones are woven     
          out of straw.         

283
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,414
         [ band plays ]         

284
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:29,921
this workshop makes traditional,
straw sombreros in many styles. 

285
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,991
 this model's called a winston. 

286
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,595
     this one, an americano.    

287
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:38,462
       here's the speedy,       

288
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,466
     after the cartoon mouse    
        speedy gonzales.        

289
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,635
         and the casidy.        

290
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,807
         these sombreros        
        are hand-crafted.       

291
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,542
 the straw is white palm leaves 

292
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,277
    purchased from a supplier   
         in the region.         

293
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,482
   first, workers soak a bunch  
   in water for a minute or so  

294
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,950
       to soften them up.       

295
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,556
      then, using a needle,     

296
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,094
        they tear strips        
   about 2/10 of an inch wide.  

297
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,370
         then they take         
     three strips at a time     

298
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,640
     and braid them together    
      into a single strand.     

299
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,787
         they intertwine        
    several braided strands,    

300
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,856
         making a long,         
       braided straw rope.      

301
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:42,460
    then they feed this rope    
 into a manually operated press.

302
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,935
   the press flattens the rope  

303
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:54,672
      until it's just about     
     4/100 of an inch thick.    

304
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:58,943
this flattening makes the coarse
    rope soft enough to sew.    

305
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,680
      with the raw-material     
         prep work done,        

306
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,349
   hat construction can begin.  

307
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,418
 they take the rope and wind it 
     in concentric circles,     

308
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,854
 sewing one circle to the next. 

309
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,764
  they first make a flat base,  

310
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,366
 then turn the base on its side 

311
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,168
         and keep sewing        
 until they've formed the cup --

312
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,672
    the part of the sombrero    
     that sits on the head.     

313
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,845
 they place the cup over a form 
       to check the size.       

314
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,315
     then they resume sewing    
       on more straw rope,      

315
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,852
       working outward now      
     to form the hat's brim.    

316
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:47,058
   brim width varies by style.  

317
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,796
    they measure to make sure   
     it's the correct size.     

318
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,935
 once the sombrero is finished, 
        they boil water,        

319
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,605
       pour in gelatin...       

320
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:05,810
           stir until           
  it's completely dissolved...  

321
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,913
        then soak the hat       
       for about a minute.      

322
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,323
     the gelatin penetrates     
        the straw fibers.       

323
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:27,766
   then they hang the sombrero  
      out to dry in the sun     

324
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,634
     for about three hours.     

325
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,836
  the workshop has a steel mold 

326
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,639
     for each sombrero style    
          it produces.          

327
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,575
   workers place the sombrero   
     on the appropriate one     

328
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,577
         in a hot press,        

329
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,880
      then close the press      
       for three minutes.       

330
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,384
 the heat and pressure combined 

331
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,919
         form the straw         
      to the mold's shape.      

332
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,322
      the heat also hardens     
          the gelatin,          

333
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,658
      locking in the shape      
          permanently.          

334
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,862
         many sombreros         
     have a decorative band     

335
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,531
 encircling the base of the cup.

336
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,533
   this band, called a scarf,   
        is hand-crafted,        

337
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,337
    typically out of leather,   
 or like this one out of magee, 

338
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,240
     a fiber from the stalk     
       of a tropical plant      

339
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,408
        native to mexico.       

340
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,479
       a few dabs of glue       
    hold the scarf in place.    

341
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,285
  once a sombrero is finished,  

342
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,954
      the workshop tags it      
       with a certificate       

343
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,323
       stating the model        
       and serial number.       

344
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,169
         sombrero shapes        
     can vary significantly,    

345
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:41,305
       but they all share       
   a common characteristic --   

346
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,375
     a wide brim to protect     
     from the blazing sun.      

347
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,311
         certain models         
    have an extra feature --    

348
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,313
  a cord or leather drawstring  

349
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,650
   so the hat doesn't fly away  
        in windy weather.

00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:03,328
