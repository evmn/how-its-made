00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:20,471
bolts per minute.               
here's what the heading stages  
look like in slow motion.       

300
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,473
here's what the heading stages  
look like in slow motion.       
this die creates a slight       

301
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,274
look like in slow motion.       
this die creates a slight       
collar.                         

302
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,410
this die creates a slight       
collar.                         
the next one turns it into a    

303
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,846
collar.                         
the next one turns it into a    
round head.                     

304
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:44,896
then the last one transforms    
that into a hexagonal head --   
the most common shape.          

305
00:12:55,173 --> 00:13:02,913
next the machine forms the      
opposite end of the bolt.       
a tool called the pointer shapes

306
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,381
opposite end of the bolt.       
a tool called the pointer shapes
the bottom of each bolt,        

307
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,850
a tool called the pointer shapes
the bottom of each bolt,        
creating what's called the      

308
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,484
the bottom of each bolt,        
creating what's called the      
chamfer, the part the nut       

309
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,821
creating what's called the      
chamfer, the part the nut       
catches on to.                  

310
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,657
chamfer, the part the nut       
catches on to.                  
here's the bullet before and    

311
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,293
catches on to.                  
here's the bullet before and    
after the chamfer.              

312
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,295
here's the bullet before and    
after the chamfer.              
the bolt needs threads to enable

313
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,997
after the chamfer.              
the bolt needs threads to enable
the nut to screw onto it.       

314
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,799
the bolt needs threads to enable
the nut to screw onto it.       
once again, they use the cold   

315
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,100
the nut to screw onto it.       
once again, they use the cold   
forging method.                 

316
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,336
once again, they use the cold   
forging method.                 
high-pressure rollers press in  

317
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,405
forging method.                 
high-pressure rollers press in  
the thread pattern...as we see  

318
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:36,447
high-pressure rollers press in  
the thread pattern...as we see  
here in slow motion.            

319
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,483
the thread pattern...as we see  
here in slow motion.            
this is the actual speed, up to 

320
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,619
here in slow motion.            
this is the actual speed, up to 
300 bolts per minute.           

321
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,755
this is the actual speed, up to 
300 bolts per minute.           
during each production run, they

322
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,823
300 bolts per minute.           
during each production run, they
take several samples to verify  

323
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,691
during each production run, they
take several samples to verify  
dimensions.                     

324
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,759
take several samples to verify  
dimensions.                     
they use various measuring      

325
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,095
dimensions.                     
they use various measuring      
devices -- a micrometer to check

326
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,397
they use various measuring      
devices -- a micrometer to check
the bolt's length, calipers to  

327
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,633
devices -- a micrometer to check
the bolt's length, calipers to  
measure the width of the head,  

328
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,801
the bolt's length, calipers to  
measure the width of the head,  
and a ring gauge to check the   

329
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,103
measure the width of the head,  
and a ring gauge to check the   
threads.                        

330
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,538
and a ring gauge to check the   
threads.                        
to make the nuts, they use a    

331
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,508
threads.                        
to make the nuts, they use a    
process called hot forging.     

332
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,809
to make the nuts, they use a    
process called hot forging.     
they cut steel bars into small  

333
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,112
process called hot forging.     
they cut steel bars into small  
pieces known as slugs, then heat

334
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,447
they cut steel bars into small  
pieces known as slugs, then heat
them to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit

335
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,049
pieces known as slugs, then heat
them to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit
to make them malleable.         

336
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,051
them to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit
to make them malleable.         
as we see here in slow motion,  

337
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,853
to make them malleable.         
as we see here in slow motion,  
hydraulic cameras punch the     

338
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,789
as we see here in slow motion,  
hydraulic cameras punch the     
slugs into hexagons, while a    

339
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:24,795
hydraulic cameras punch the     
slugs into hexagons, while a    
die pierces the hole.           

340
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,897
slugs into hexagons, while a    
die pierces the hole.           
then a tool called a tapper     

341
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,133
die pierces the hole.           
then a tool called a tapper     
drives into the hole to cut the 

342
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,001
then a tool called a tapper     
drives into the hole to cut the 
threads.                        

343
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,136
drives into the hole to cut the 
threads.                        
that black liquid is a lubricant

344
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,272

that black liquid is a lubricant
oil to minimize wear and tear on

345
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:40,110
that black liquid is a lubricant

346
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,080
oil to minimize wear and tear on
the tappers.                    
the nuts and bolts now go into  

347
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,847
the tappers.                    
the nuts and bolts now go into  
an oven at 1,600 degrees        

348
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,084
the nuts and bolts now go into  
an oven at 1,600 degrees        
fahrenheit for about an hour.   

349
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,818
an oven at 1,600 degrees        
fahrenheit for about an hour.   
this gives them the required    

350
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,019
fahrenheit for about an hour.   
this gives them the required    
strength.                       

351
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,155
this gives them the required    
strength.                       
then a rapid cooling in oil for 

352
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,024
strength.                       
then a rapid cooling in oil for 
five minutes to solidify the

00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,925
then a rapid cooling in oil for 
five minutes to solidify the    
steel's internal structure.     

354
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,895
five minutes to solidify the    
steel's internal structure.     
by now the steel is hard, but   

355
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,029
steel's internal structure.     
by now the steel is hard, but   
brittle, so they heat the nuts  

356
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,765
by now the steel is hard, but   
brittle, so they heat the nuts  
and bolts for another hour.     

357
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,566
brittle, so they heat the nuts  
and bolts for another hour.     
this removes their brittleness  

358
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:09,774
and bolts for another hour.     
this removes their brittleness  
yet maintains their strength.   

359
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,776
this removes their brittleness  
yet maintains their strength.   
the quality-control team pulls

how much force it takes to break

362
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,781

roll.                           

398
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,539
introduced bathroom tissue on a 
roll.                           
ever wonder where all that      

399
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,107
roll.                           
ever wonder where all that      
recycled paper goes?            

400
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,209
ever wonder where all that      
recycled paper goes?            
well, look no further than your

00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,010
recycled paper goes?            
well, look no further than your 
bathroom.                       

402
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,446
well, look no further than your 
bathroom.                       
many brands of toilet paper

bathroom.                       
many brands of toilet paper     
begin as recycled paper.        

404
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,850
many brands of toilet paper     
begin as recycled paper.        
the bales of paper drop down

00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,219
begin as recycled paper.        
the bales of paper drop down    
into the pulper, a giant tank   

406
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,555
the bales of paper drop down    
into the pulper, a giant tank   
with an agitator, similar to a

it mixes the paper in lukewarm  
water for about 10 minutes,     

410
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,228
it mixes the paper in lukewarm  
water for about 10 minutes,     
transforming it into what's     

411
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,164
water for about 10 minutes,     
transforming it into what's     
known as pulp and screening out 

412
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,765
transforming it into what's     
known as pulp and screening out 
all the bits of metal and       

413
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,466
known as pulp and screening out 
all the bits of metal and

414
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,734
all the bits of metal and       
plastic.                        
now they have to take out the   

415
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,437
plastic.                        
now they have to take out the   
ink.                            

416
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,438
now they have to take out the   
ink.                            
the ink-removal system injects  

417
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
ink.                            
the ink-removal system injects  
the pulp with air.              

418
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,708
the ink-removal system injects  
the pulp with air.              
ink particles attach to the air 

419
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,644
the pulp with air.              
ink particles attach to the air 
bubbles, which rise to the top. 

420
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,946
ink particles attach to the air 
bubbles, which rise to the top. 
the system then skims off the   

421
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:34,284
bubbles, which rise to the top. 
the system then skims off the   
foam, leaving the pulp ink-free.

422
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,153
the system then skims off the   
foam, leaving the pulp ink-free.
next the pulp passes through a  

423
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,055
foam, leaving the pulp ink-free.
next the pulp passes through a  
series of rollers, which squeeze

425
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,958
series of rollers, which squeeze
out the water.                  
this dries out the soggy pulp,  

426
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,527
out the water.                  
this dries out the soggy pulp,  
enabling it to absorb the

00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,949
pure white.                     
the company says it does this   
without using chlorine or other

439
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,685
without using chlorine or other 
toxic chemicals.                
they spread the wet pulp onto a

in less than a second, the pulp 
dries into a delicate paper     

444
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,164
in less than a second, the pulp 
dries into a delicate paper     
4/1000 of an inch thick.

each spool holds close to 47    
miles of paper.                 

447
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,370
each spool holds close to 47    
miles of paper.                 
that spool now feeds a machine  

448
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,172
miles of paper.                 
that spool now feeds a machine  
with rollers that emboss a

machine.                        
the two sheets come together to 
form a two-ply toilet paper.    

473
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:48,252
the paper then winds onto a     
cardboard tube, creating a      
super-wide roll of toilet paper.
