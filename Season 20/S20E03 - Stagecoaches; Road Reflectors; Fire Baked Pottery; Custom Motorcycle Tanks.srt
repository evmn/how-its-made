      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,845
           narrator:            
      ...and water skis.        

4
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,522
    whether it's a hangnail     
       that needs fixing        

5
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,391
    or it's simply time for a   
             trim,              

6
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:01,460
 a nail nipper is a good thing  
  to have at your fingertips.   

7
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,529
 a nipper is a precision tool,  

8
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,631
        one that offers         
      a bit more control        

9
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,133
  than lever-style clippers.    

10
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:10,770
     the result is usually      
    a more manicured look.      

11
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,143
           heavy duty           
 and made of stainless steel,   

12
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,546
  the nipper nail cutter looks  
               as               
 if it belongs in a tool chest  

13
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,884
   and it actually works like   
        cutter pliers.          

14
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,155
     squeezing the handles      

15
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,290
    brings the curved blades    
      at the end together       

16
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,627
 for a well-rounded trim job.   

17
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,562
       the handles offer        
  a bit moore maneuverability   

18
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:42,101
    than the lever mechanism    
  on a standard nail clipper.   

19
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,904
     production begins with     
  these forged-steel blanks.    

20
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,709
     they'll make two pairs     
of nail nippers from each one.  

21
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,510
      they load the blanks      
        onto a carriage         

22
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,280
      that transports them      
        into a furnace.         

23
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,716
  subjected to intense heat,    

24
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,051
    the steel blanks become     

25
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,821
    white-hot and malleable     
          in minutes.           

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,794
       the foundry worker       
  transfers a blank to a die.   

27
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,229
   he moves it across the die   
       and flips it over        

28
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,798
   as a hammer slams it into    

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,134
        the shape of two        
      nail-nipper shanks,       

30
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,103
   each with a cutting head.    

31
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,272
   it takes several strikes     

32
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:24,210
 to create the right impression 
  on both sides of the blank.   

33
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,350
   the process transforms the   
    narrow blank into a wider   
             piece              

34
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,086
      with two nail-nipper      
          formations.           

35
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,890
    this is the blank before    
             forging            
           and now.             

36
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,895
 once the two shanks have been  
    separated and trimmed,      

37
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,097
      a drill cuts a hole       
     under the blade end.       

38
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,298
    this is the area where      

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,967
       the nipper shanks        
       are to be joined.        

40
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,704
         a milling tool         
     shaves down the area       

41
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,573
  for a neat and level joint.   

42
00:02:54,575 --> 00:03:01,447
 this is the nail-nipper shank  
    before the joint work and   
             after.             

43
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:05,050
    they transfer the nipper    
             shanks             
    to a finishing machine.     

44
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,986
 they bounce around in a stream 
  of abrasive ceramic pebbles   

45
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,188
       for a few hours.         

46
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,558
 this rubs off the rough bits.  

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,795
     a magnetized conveyor      
  pulls out the steel shanks,   

48
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:19,065
  leaving the ceramics behind   
     and carries the shanks     
            forward.            

49
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,939
       an employee sands        
   the entire surface of each   
             shank              

50
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,375
         until it looks         
      completely smooth.        

51
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,348
         he brushes oil         
      onto a shank joint        

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,684
 to prevent rust and abrasion.  

53
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,355
   it's time to rivet the two   
 nail-nipper shanks together.   

54
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,890
the rivets funnel into tooling  

55
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,559
        above and below         
    the nail-nipper shanks.     

56
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,097
    the machinery drives the    
             rivets             
 into the holes in the shanks.  

57
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,303
          once joined,          
  they cannot be pulled apart   

58
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,840
 without completely destroying  
       the nail nippers.        

59
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,578
         at this point,         
 the rivets protrude slightly   

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,749
   and could snag on clothing   
       or other things.         

61
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,651
 an employee sands each rivet   

62
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:17,790
  until it's on the same plane  
    as the rest of the nipper   
             joint.             

63
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:18,991
     the vigorous sanding       

64
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,361
      makes the rivet seem      
     to almost disappear.       

65
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,199
          he polishes           
    the inside of the nipper    
             blades             

66
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,668
      to completely smooth      
         the surfaces.          

67
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,070
        an even surface         

68
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,071
 can be more thoroughly cleaned 
        and disinfected         

69
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,107
      between manicures.        

70
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,749
           the blades           
are still blunt at this point.  

71
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:46,885
  the next member of the team   
    files them on an angle      

72
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,155
 to give them a cutting edge.   

73
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:52,158
filing too little could hamper  

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,627
         the clearance          
      between the blades.       

75
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,730
        filing too much         
     would ruin the nippers     
           entirely.            

76
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,767
    he tests them on paper.     

77
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,437
   if the cutting edge slips,   
the blades may need more work.  

78
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,574
  if they slice right through,  
      they're just right.       

79
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,780
    next, he clamps the nail    
             nippers            
    onto a circular bench.      

80
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,782
          it revolves           
    to meet up with a laser     

81
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,451
  that etches the company logo  
     and other information      

82
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,854
       onto the shanks.         

83
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,658
  after that, they drill holes  
      and attach a spring       

84
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,862
      to make the nippers       
   easier to open and close.    

85
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:33,332
      for the professional      
     who will be opening and    
            closing             

86
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,334
       these nail nippers       
  a few hundred times a day,    

87
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,804
   this is a nifty feature.     

88
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,540
        they manufacture        
      these nail nippers        

89
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:46,946
 in batches of 300 or 400 over  
 a period of about two weeks,   

90
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:50,316
    so they're should always    
      be plenty on hand.        

91
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,999
           narrator:            
 this putter is made of jade,   

92
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:10,569
 a precious stone traditionally 
used in jewelry and sculpture.  

93
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,638
 long coveted for its beauty,   

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,240
       jade is in demand        
     on the putting green.      

95
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,711
 as tough as steel with a feel  
 that's distinctly different,   

96
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:22,348
     a putter made of jade      
   is definitely up to par.     

97
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,920
   the jade putter is among     

98
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,055
     a number of new clubs      
        on the green...         

99
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:38,130
   along with crystal quartz    
  and fossilized vegetation,    

100
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:41,533
   known as petrified wood.     

101
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,603
     to make a jade putter,     
  they head for the hills --    

102
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:49,041
    specifically, a nephrite    
   jade outcrop in wyoming.     

103
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:56,048
  here, the putter maker finds  
     a 20-foot wide vein of     
           nephrite.            

104
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:02,487
 this stone has taken 2 billion 
   years to form and develop    

105
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,525
    a very hard and fibrous     
    crystalline structure.      

106
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,229
   the carver selects slabs     

107
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,832
 that are thick enough to shape 
    into four or five putter    
             heads.             

108
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,037
     this one has weathered     
       to a rusty color,        

109
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,439
but it should clean up nicely.  

110
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,840
   the color of wyoming jade    

111
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:25,077
   ranges from white to green   
           to black.            

112
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,581
    he strikes the slab with    
  a sledgehammer a few times    

113
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,251
        to break it down        
  to a more manageable size.    

114
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,588
    he slices through one of    
the cut pieces with a rock saw  

115
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,593
 while flushing it with coolant 
  to save the diamond blade.    

116
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,395
     he makes 9 or 10 cuts      

117
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:48,600
  to rough out the triangular   
   mallet shape of the putter   
             head.              

118
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,171
     he slices off the ends     
 to complete the basic shape.   

119
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,144
   next, he anchors the jade    
        in a wooden jig         

120
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:04,116
     and cuts on an angle to    
             profile            
 the sides of the putter head.  

121
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,419
 he slices off a back section   

122
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,757
  to give the putter clearance  
  from the ground when swung.   

123
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,561
          this putter           
    has really taken shape.     

124
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:18,030
      he removes material       
       from the corners         

125
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:20,032
       to center the mass       
     behind the golf ball       

126
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,300
   for more striking energy.    

127
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,639
       he sands the edges       
   to round and soften them.    

128
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,108
   he's careful not to remove   
     too much in one place      

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,045
   because that would affect    
         the symmetry.          

130
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,982
        he then polishes        
   the entire piece of jade     

131
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,184
    against diamond-abrasive    
             belts.             

132
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,222
   it's an intensive process    
  that takes about two hours.   

133
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:50,462
 he aims a drill and cores into 
 the putter head on a 20 angle  

134
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:54,933
         to make a hole         
    for inserting the putter    
             shaft.             

135
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:58,937
   a perpetual flow of water    
   keeps the diamond core bit   
              cool              

136
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,608
      and also flushes out      
  the little bits of filings.   

137
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,546
   he gently taps the drilled   
              core              
           to jar it            

138
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,615
       so it falls out of       
       the putter head.         

139
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,888
       a laser emblazons        
    the product name onto the   
             jade,              

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,424
       swiftly etching it       
       into the surface.        

141
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:24,363
 the putters can be customized  
   with a customer's name and   
             logo.              

142
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,299
  he swabs gold-colored paint   
    into the laser etching      

143
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,301
      to make the letters       
       really stand out.        

144
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,637
      the swabbing leaves       

145
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,773
    a lot of residual paint     
      around the letters,       

146
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,909
      so he rubs it off.        

147
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,913
   he sprays the putter with    
       a wax-based gloss        

148
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,517
      to seal the stone.        

149
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,853
        he then buffs it        
      against a felt belt       

150
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:51,356
    to give the jade a satiny   
             sheen.             

151
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,531
  he mixes epoxy ingredients    

152
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:04,002
      to attach the shaft       
  to the jade putter's head.    

153
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:08,941
       he deposits epoxy        
   in the hole in the shaft.    

154
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,882
   he inserts the steel shaft   
    into the 20-angle hole.     

155
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,154
     the angle of the hole      
  positions the putter shaft    

156
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,556
     to match the golfer's      
        upright stance.         

157
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,095
   once the pistol-style grip   
     has been slipped on,       

158
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:34,233
   he applies a metallic-look   
              decal             
        just below it.          

159
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,836
       the decal displays       
  company contact information   

160
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,304
   in the event of a problem    

161
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,374
  that doesn't have to do with  
    the golfer's technique.     

162
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,444
after cleaning and inspection,  

163
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:49,180
        this jade putter        
     is ready for action.       

164
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,050
  putters carved from jade and  
        other materials         

165
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,986
     are crafty editions to     
     the golf-club arsenal      

166
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,757
     and could lead to some     
  artful moves on the green.    

167
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,676
           narrator:            
    ice cider is an alcoholic   
             drink              

168
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,279
      made from fermented,      
 frozen apples or apple juice.  

169
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,081
       it's also known as       
        apple ice wine          

170
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,084
        and is produced         
   the same way as ice wine     

171
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,020
        but with apples         
      instead of grapes.        

172
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,089
   it's typically served with   
              food              
      such as foie gras,        

173
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,293
         cheese, fruit,         
      and dark chocolate.       

174
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,762
 there's a world of difference  

175
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,764
       between ice cider        
      and regular cider.        

176
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,568
         regular cider          
  is made from fresh apples,    

177
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,103
       whereas ice cider        
  is made from frozen apples    

178
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,439
    or frozen apple juice.      

179
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,575
     and while cider can be     
   a non-alcoholic beverage,    

180
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,845
ice cider is always alcoholic.  

181
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,447
     there are two methods      
     to making ice cider.       

182
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,183
   one is to leave the apples   
          on the tree           

183
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,521
   to freeze over the winter,   
then pick them and press them.  

184
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:05,323
       the other method,        
   which we're about to see,    

185
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,526
    is to harvest the apples    
in the fall when they're ripe,  

186
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,129
          press them,           
    then freeze the juice.      

187
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,402
     the apples are always      
handpicked at perfect maturity  

188
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,405
and always right off the tree.  

189
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,542
     an ice-cider producer      
   never uses fallen apples     

190
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,678
 because they often get damaged 
   when they hit the ground     

191
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,048
   and then pick up bacteria    
       from lying there.        

192
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,019
       this producer uses       
 different varieties of apples  

193
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,822
     to make several types      
         of ice cider.          

194
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:41,026
 the one we're about to see is  
  made from empire, spartan,    

195
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,396
      cortland, mcintosh,       
      and golden russet.        

196
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:48,700
  straight from the orchard,    

197
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,435
       the apples go onto       
        a conveyor belt         

198
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,105
     which feeds them into      
      a multistage press.       

199
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,714
  the first part of the press   
      crushes the apples        

200
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,150
 into what's known as pumice.   

201
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,594
   a screw conveyor moves the   
   pumice onto a mesh conveyor  
              belt              

202
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,399
   that transports it through   
 five stainless-steel rollers.  

203
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:24,536
      each roller applies       
    275 pounds of pressure,     

204
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,539
    progressively extracting    
       the apple juice.         

205
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,617
 the juice drains down through  
    the mesh conveyor belt      

206
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,553
        to a vat below.         

207
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,095
   from the vat, the juice is   
 pumped into a large container  

208
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,232
  made of food-safe plastic.    

209
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,305
     the container holds 264    
            gallons.            

210
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:04,042
      however, they leave       
 13 to 26 gallons of air space  

211
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:08,246
  to leave room for expansion   
    when the juice freezes.     

212
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,447
    at the end of december,     

213
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,316
    they haul the containers    
           outdoors.            

214
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,654
    the juice stays outside     
      from 40 to 50 days,       

215
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,256
       during which time        
   the water in it freezes,     

216
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,458
            leaving             
 unfrozen, concentrated juice   

217
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,728
      at the bottom of the      
           container.           

218
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,031
        workers measure         
   the sugar content daily,     

219
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,067
      and once it reaches       
       a certain level,         

220
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,602
  they pump the juice indoors   

221
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:34,005
  into temperature-controlled,  
    stainless-steel tanks.      

222
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,541
      then they add yeast       
 to kick-start fermentation --  

223
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,379
    the conversion of those     
  natural sugars to alcohol.    

224
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,416
           every day,           
 they measure the sugar level   

225
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,952
           to monitor           
   the fermentation process.    

226
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,619
  when they hit their target,   

227
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,623
     which typically takes      
    between 40 and 50 days,     

228
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,958
   the juice has transformed    
        into ice cider          

229
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,630
    with an alcohol content     
       of 10.5% to 11%.         

230
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,369
      ice cider is bottled      
        just like wine.         

231
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,043
      the corking machine       
 automatically pops in a cork   

232
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,680
 as soon as its sensor detects  
   the presence of a bottle.    

233
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,355
        the next machine        
     slips a plastic seal       

234
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,125
 over the mouth of the bottle,  
    then heats the plastic      

235
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,162
       to shrink the seal       
   tightly around the cork.     

236
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,673
            finally,            
 an automated labeling machine  

237
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,009
     simultaneously applies     
     self-sticking labels       

238
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,811
    to the front and back.      

239
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,147
     it isn't only the apple    
             variety            
  that determines the flavor.   

240
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,218
    it's also the production    
            method.             

241
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,155
  the process we've just seen,  
   called cryoconcentration,    

242
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:01,492
    produces ice cider with     
   a strong, fruity flavor.     

243
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,962
       the other method,        
   called cryoextraction --     

244
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,964
    letting apples freeze on    
  the tree, then pressing them  
               --               

245
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,036
    produces ice cider which    
   tastes like baked apples.    

246
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,187
     narrator: water skiing     
     was invented in 1922       

247
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,123
    by an american teenager     
    named ralph samuelson.      

248
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,458
        with his brother        
   pulling him by motorboat,    

249
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,862
   he experimented first with   
  skis made of barrel staves,   

250
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,664
     then with snow skis,       

251
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:44,436
   then with skis he had made   
 out of pine boards 94" long.   

252
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,741
   this type of water skiing    
      is known as slalom,       

253
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,477
    winding through a course    
    on a single water ski,      

254
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,681
   one foot behind the other,   
 in boots mounted to the ski.   

255
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,350
       the core of these        
        top-of-the-line         

256
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,687
    competition slalom skis     
  is high-density pvc foam --   

257
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,823
     exceptionally strong,      
       yet lightweight.         

258
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,026
   a computer-guided machine    
      cuts the ski shape,       

259
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,164
          then pockets          
to receive various components.  

260
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,233
            workers             
  flip the core upside down,    

261
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:18,136
        and the machine         
      shapes the bottom.        

262
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,645
   workers then turn the core   
      right-side up again       

263
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:30,849
    and fill the pockets with   
             glue.              

264
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,851
  they insert an alignment tab  
      in the tail pocket        

265
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,788
   to help correctly position   
     the core in the mold.      

266
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,791
   they install fiberglassed,   
    reinforced nylon blocks     

267
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,259
        in the others.          

268
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,194
       these will anchor        
       threaded inserts         

269
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,397
          for mounting          
 the boots and the ski's fin.   

270
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,600
         now they begin         
   building up the water ski    

271
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,801
      with multiple layers      
       of carbon fiber,         

272
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,938
    an ultra-strong fabric.     

273
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,540
   they apply the first layer   
        to the bottom,          

274
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,475
wrapping it around to the top.  

275
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,944
           this will            
prevent the ski from twisting.  

276
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,013
      after stapling down       
       the carbon fiber         

277
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,750
  and trimming off the excess,  
  they saturate it with resin   

278
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,420
     and apply carbon fiber     
    to the top of the ski.      

279
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:12,023
   depending on the model and   
         its performance        
        specifications,         

280
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,025
       they wrap the core       
     in up to seven layers      

281
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,761
    of resin-saturated carbon   
             fiber,             

282
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,631
      controlling the flex      
 in select areas along the way  

283
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,566
   with additional patches.     

284
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,002
     then they top the ski      

285
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,771
     with a layer of woven,     
       synthetic fabric         

286
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,375
    to prime the surface for    
   the decorative graphics.     

287
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,644
   on the bottom of the ski,    

288
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,913
     they apply a sheet of      
  super-lightweight polymer.    

289
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,982
 it creates a white background  

290
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,851
          to highlight          
  the printed polyester sheet   

291
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,053
    of decorative graphics.     

292
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,922
       they coat it with        
        a special resin         

293
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:47,191
        that cures into         
 a hard, hydrodynamic surface   

294
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,928
that increase the ski's speed.  

295
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,932
    the graphic design that     
 decorates the top of the ski   

296
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,800
     is printed on nylon.       

297
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,803
  they mount it to the top part 
               of               
      a ski-shaped mold,        

298
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,040
   then lay the wrapped core    
     into the bottom part.      

299
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,476
    a heated press closes the   
             mold,              

300
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:10,415
 compressing the contents under 
     high pressure for nine     
            minutes.            

301
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:14,152
     this bonds the layers,     
  forms contours in the ski,    

302
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:18,156
   and adheres the graphics.    

303
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,493
   the pressure squeezes out    
     excess resin along the     
           perimeter            

304
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,828
      so once they remove       
    the ski from the mold,      

305
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,065
    they cut off the excess     
       with a band saw.         

306
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,306
           then with            
   a custom-made router bit,    

307
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,110
      they precision-trim       
   to exact specifications.     

308
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:52,590
   next, a three-phase filing   
     of the ski's edge --       

309
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:56,393
    first with a large file,    
      then a small file,        

310
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:01,332
 then with either a razor blade 
   or medium-grit sandpaper.    

311
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,867
           then with            
    the help of a template,     

312
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,536
      they drill 18 holes       

313
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:08,807
           into those           
      fiberglass-reinforced     
   nylon blocks in the core.    

314
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,611
  they screw a threaded insert  
        into each hole,         

315
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,880
 and it locks into the block.   

316
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,017
     there are more inserts     
  that are actually required    

317
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,352
      for mounting the fin      
 and attaching the ski boots.   

318
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,957
      this gives the skier      
different positioning options.  

319
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:31,162
   now the last edge-sanding    
     with fine-grit paper.      

320
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:35,366
  after wiping down the entire  
               ski              
with an alcohol-based cleaner,  

321
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,303
     they install the final     
  and most important component  
               --               

322
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,572
           the fin.             

323
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,841
     it's made of aluminum      
   that's chemically treated    

324
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:47,312
   to be corrosion-resistant    
      and ultra-durable.        

325
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,851
      the fin's position        

326
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,521
  critically affects the ski's  
    traction and stability,     

327
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:59,390
    so they use a micrometer    
 to measure to the millimeter,  

328
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,927
   securing the fin precisely   
              where             
 the design engineer specified  

329
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,097
             in the             
    performance-maximization    
          sweet spot.           

330
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,003
          nonetheless,          
   competitive water-skiers     

331
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,140
   typically readjust the fin   
   to their own preferences     

332
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,644
       in hopes of leaving      
           competitors          
        in their wake.
