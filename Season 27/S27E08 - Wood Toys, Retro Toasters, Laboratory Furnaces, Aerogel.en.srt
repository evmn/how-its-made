narrator: a rubber tree's life-span    

5
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,857
for natural rubber production is limited to about 25 years.  

6
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,459
but making toys out of their wood        

7
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:03,663
gives unproductive trees a second life.          

8
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:06,932
this idea comes from southeastern asia,     

9
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,536
home to most of the rubber and latex production worldwide.           

10
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,141
this company, based in thailand,        

11
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,744
manufactures toys such as this series       

12
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:24,417
of animal-shaped racers made of locally farmed rubberwood.  

13
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,618
they buy old trees        

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,888
that have exceeded their productive life.      

15
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,357
a worker feeds lumber through a wood-rounding machine.            

16
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,894
the machine drives the log through a mill          

17
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:37,830
and turns it into a rod.     

18
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,299
the worker places the rod on a tray            

19
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:44,370
alongside other pieces ready for cutting.        

20
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:48,307
a cutting machine automatically         
matches the length of the rods  

21
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,176
while a round saw cuts out blanks,         

22
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:52,111
which accumulate in a crate.   

23
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,718
a router removes the sharp edges on the blanks.          

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,387
stacked in a feeder tube,    

25
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,524
the blanks drop down one by one on the router table.   

26
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,126
an automated feeding mechanism  

27
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,662
pushes each blank against the router head.     

28
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,130
the router blade bites      

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,466
into the blank and trims off the edge,     

30
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,036
leaving the pieces ready for sanding.        

31
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,674
at another station, a lathe   

32
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,076
turns spherical shapes out of the wood.         

33
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:28,748
several blades move in sequence to form the piece.        

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,215
when a new length of wood comes through,      

35
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,150
the front blade moves in.    

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,152
once it backs away,       

37
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,822
another set of blades shapes the piece laterally    

38
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:41,827
before a cutter blade separates it from the rod.    

39
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,764
a worker now pours a nontoxic, water-based paint        

40
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,833
over the sanded blanks.     

41
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,103
he transfers the batch into a tumbling machine.     

42
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,839
the tumbling process will even out the color     

43
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,910
and drain the extra paint to accelerate drying.      

44
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:01,513
the worker closes and secures the lid of the tumbler      

45
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,516
before he starts the machine.  

46
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:10,188
the facility can simultaneously process 40 batches        

47
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,925
of painted parts in 30 minutes.          

48
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,394
the painted parts now go to a pad printer.     

49
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,531
an automated arm feeds the parts to the printer,         

50
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,400
which stamps each piece with a nontoxic paint.      

51
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,135
a worker uses a table saw    

52
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,671
to groove another set of painted parts.        

53
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,542
the custom-made jig ensures that the cut is straight and even   

54
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,477
and that the blade makes only a narrow       

55
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,646
and shallow groove in the wood.              

56
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,018
the worker places the grooved part         

57
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,655
on a jig and bores a hole into the piece with a drill.   

58
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,893
the machined piece goes to another pad printer.   

59
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,362
the pad picks up paint from a tray           

60
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,564
and transfers it to the wood.  

61
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,501
this process, called tampography, allows the printer             

62
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,370
to reproduce a design on an irregular surface,     

63
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,240
such as this wood piece.     

64
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,776
the printed parts dry at room temperature.     

65
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,313
as a last pad printer paints two dots on the wood,   

66
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:13,652
the face of the animal racer slowly takes shape.       

67
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:17,590
this red-colored powder is processed rubberwood sawdust             

68
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:21,126
entirely recycled        
from the machining operations.  

69
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,530
a worker fills molds with the reprocessed sawdust   

70
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,667
and prepares them for casting.  

71
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,338
the machine compresses the sawdust in a die       

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,005
and turns it into a solid    

73
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,943
and compact material called planwood.         

74
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,679
a worker starts assembling the planwood pieces       

75
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,415
to form the body of the racers.             

76
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,683
she applies a thin coat     

77
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,486
of nontoxic, formaldehyde-free glue      

78
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:51,957
and presses two corresponding planwood pieces together.    

79
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,827
she removes the excess glue with her finger         

80
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,228
before she hammers a dowel    

81
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,965
into the assembled planwood body.          

82
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,700
to finish the head of the racer,          

83
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,036
she inserts a felt piece into the groove         

84
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,306
machined on top and presses the head       

85
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,943
into the racer's body using a pneumatic press.     

86
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,048
the worker then drives the axles              

87
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,785
through holes in the planwood assembly.    

88
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,454
she takes painted and pad-printed wheels      

89
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,790
and applies a drop of fast-hardening glue      

90
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,659
inside each wheel hub.      

91
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:33,665
she then hammers the wheels into the axles          

92
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,267
and takes the assembled toy   

93
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,469
to a customized machine designed            

94
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,272
to press the wheels firmly into the axles.      

95
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,811
this finished chicken racer is one of a wide variety     

96
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,279
of rubberwood toys        

97
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,081
manufactured with        
environment-friendly processes  

98
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,884
and materials.          

99
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,635
narrator: whether your preferred shade is light, medium, or dark,              

100
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,838
owning a reliable electric toaster that evenly heats    

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,040
and browns both sides of your bread just the way    

102
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:19,511
you like it is one of life's small pleasures.    

103
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,914
and if that toaster adds some style to your kitchen,            

104
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,649
all the better.         

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,188
making retro-style toasters is this british company's    

106
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,657
bread and butter.        

107
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,725
while some of its models are new designs         

108
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,327
in a vintage style,       

109
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,930
this one is authentically retro,             

110
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:41,066
in continuous production since the 1960s.         

111
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:46,005
the manufacturing equipment, however, is modern.       

112
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:49,141
a computer-guided laser cutter cuts out many components     

113
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:53,812
from sheet steel coated with  
zinc for corrosion resistance.  

114
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,214
they stamp the company logo   

115
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,816
and then use the same press   

116
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:02,354
to begin forming a rectangular box.        

117
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:05,491
they bend three sides on this press...         

118
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,894
then bend the fourth       

119
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,931
on a machine called a box folder.       

120
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:21,240
they rivet the body closed, then spray on a thick layer      

121
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,509
of paint powder known as powder coat.      

122
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,912
then, they run the body through a tunnel oven      

123
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,583
for 10 minutes to bake the finish.       

124
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,119
the computer-guided laser cutter also        

125
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,854
cuts out several toaster tops  

126
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,191
from a sheet of stainless steel.             

127
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,859
this model is a four-slice toaster,     

128
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,196
so the machine cuts four slots per top.     

129
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:48,000
to make the manual bread ejector that pops up the hot toast,   

130
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:52,471
they weld steel strips to a round steel bar.      

131
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,741
moving the toaster's ejector knob lifts this bar,   

132
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,077
raising the top of the toast out of the slot.  

133
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,878
they bend the strips,      

134
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,347
creating a cradle to stabilize the bread      

135
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,549
so that it doesn't wobble and get caught          

136
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,887
while moving up and down within the slot.         

137
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,023
this machine makes the toaster's guard wires    

138
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,225
out of copper-coated steel.   

139
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,228
the guard wires are barriers that prevent the bread      

140
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,697
from touching the toaster's heating elements.            

141
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,834
the machine first welds cut horizontal wires       

142
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,104
to four continuous vertical ones.          

143
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:27,172
then, a blade chops the vertical wires     

144
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:32,711
every 12 inches, producing two side-by-side guard wires.  

145
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,647
workers cut them apart on a guillotine, then,      

146
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,251
with a hand press,       
fold over the top of each one.  

147
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,586
this prevents the bread     

148
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:44,255
from catching on the top of the guard wires.       

149
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,191
now they take the toasting compartment     

150
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,060
and insert the eight guard wires,      

151
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:51,263
one for each side of the four bread slots.     

152
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,937
then, they install the bread ejector.        

153
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,805
next, the heating elements.   

154
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,340
being a high-end toaster,    

155
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,811
the elements are sheets of pure mica,          

156
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:09,548
a mineral that's heat-resistant up to 1,800 degrees fahrenheit.           

157
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,082
they connect them with      

158
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,718
electrically conductive copper links.     

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,020
they mount the switch      

160
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:19,158
that selects the number of bread slices to toast.    

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,893
then, they install a red neon light that illuminates      

162
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,029
when you start the toaster and turns off          

163
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,931
when the toast time has elapsed.            

164
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,500
the timer switch has a bell   

165
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,103
that sounds when the toast time is up,      

166
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:35,507
at which point the switch cuts the current to the elements.   

167
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,243
they attach the dials for the slice selector      

168
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,912
and timer switches        

169
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,614
and connect their wires to the main power cord.     

170
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,551
then, they place the toaster compartment     

171
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:50,522
into the body and screw on    

172
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,591
the toaster's stainless steel top,       

173
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,960
the protective film now removed.            

174
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,600
they flip the toaster upside down           

175
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,436
and wire up the elements.    

176
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,542
they install the ejector knob,  

177
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:14,546
positioning its spring against the bread ejector.    

178
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,217
when the bell rings, indicating your toast is ready,             

179
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:22,888
you move the knob to raise and retrieve your slices.    

180
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,957
a technician tests the toaster thoroughly, ensuring       

181
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,359
that all of the elements heat to the correct temperature,   

182
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,296
that only the selected slots heat up,          

183
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,031
that the timer is accurate,   

184
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:37,636
and that the bell rings when the selected time elapses.            

185
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,837
[ bell dings ]          

186
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,172
they install the removable crumb tray,           

187
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,108
then close up the bottom of the toaster          

188
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,911
with a ventilated base plate.  

189
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:49,247
nylon feet elevate the toaster for ventilation   

190
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,783
and to prevent the screws attaching the base        

191
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,785
from scratching your kitchen counter.      

192
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,721
the style may be retro,     

193
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,325
but this 1960s-design toaster was ahead of its time      

194
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,194
with its energy-saving slice-selector feature      

195
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,330
that stops the toaster's empty slots           

196
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,432
from heating up unnecessarily.  

197
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,150
narrator: laboratory furnaces  

198
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,952
are small but powerful appliances.     

199
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,686
they can reach temperatures   

200
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,289
of 3,000 degrees fahrenheit or more.       

201
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,092
these incredible furnaces are often used to test      

202
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:38,162
the quality of things like fuel oil, greases, coal,  

203
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,400
and to confirm the strength of structural materials.     

204
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:49,641
exposed to the red-hot intensity of a laboratory furnace,     

205
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,243
this piece of steel       

206
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,112
should endure and even be strengthened by the exposure.            

207
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:58,183
it's the ultimate test of the steel's integrity.    

208
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,320
making a laboratory furnace   
starts with this laser cutter.  

209
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:06,324
it carves out steel panels for the lower cabinet.      

210
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,794
a press brake folds the panels with precision          

211
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:12,931
to make three-sided pieces of cabinetry.          

212
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,301
a worker stacks them up.     

213
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,203
the next worker applies a powder coat      

214
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:22,808
to the metal parts using a compressed-air sprayer.            

215
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:28,547
when baked on, the powder forms a tough thermoplastic skin.   

216
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,148
at the next station, a worker  

217
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,284
tucks the end of an iron alloy wire      

218
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:35,420
into a lathe.          

219
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,754
as the lathe spins,       

220
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,157
it winds the wire around a mandrel,        

221
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,626
producing a tight coil.     

222
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,695
this coiled wire will serve   

223
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:47,566
as one of the furnace's two heating elements.      

224
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,435
after stretching the coil to widen the gaps        

225
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,104
and bending it to create parallel rows,     

226
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:57,509
the technician attaches electrical clips.    

227
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,776
he flips a switch.        

228
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,380
and electricity surges through the coil.     

229
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,648
this relieves stresses in the metal caused       

230
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,617
by the winding and bending.   

231
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,523
he now inserts two coils into the ridges of the mold.   

232
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:16,661
he transfers it to a vat filled with a ceramic fiber mixture.  

233
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,998
a powerful vacuum pump pulls the mixture into the mold,              

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,833
filling all the crevices.    

235
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,670
the vacuum then draws out the moisture.     

236
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,874
the coils are now embedded in a ceramic cake.        

237
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,876
this cake bakes in an oven overnight       

238
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,276
and solidifies,         

239
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,348
encasing and insulating the heating coils.        

240
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,885
a worker cuts the solid ceramic-fiber block in two,   

241
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,888
creating two separate heating modules.  

242
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,457
he trims them so they fit neatly in the furnace chamber.     

243
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,427
a computerized router cuts out other insulation pieces             

244
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,298
to fit the rest of the furnace chamber.     

245
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,302
this ceramic brick is a threshold insulator.    

246
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,372
this piece is a surround for the furnace door.      

247
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,241
a team now puts all the ceramic fiber pieces together      

248
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,445
in a metal framework.      

249
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,713
the heating element blocks form the sides          

250
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,649
of the furnace chamber.     

251
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,918
they thread the wires from the coils          

252
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,919
through the back panel.     

253
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,855
they insert the side and back panels         

254
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,923
in the framework.        

255
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,192
they assemble the other ceramic fiber parts       

256
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,529
to form an insulated chamber.  

257
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,665
they screw the framework tight,             

258
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,800
and this nestles the ceramic-fiber walls     

259
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:32,270
more closely together.      

260
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,740
they tuck the threshold insulator into place,      

261
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,777
completing the laboratory furnace's heated chamber.    

262
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,416
a technician now places the furnace's          

263
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,952
electric heating control panel in the lower cabinet.      

264
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:52,290
he fastens it to the metal cabinet with screws.       

265
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,894
he wires the temperature-control board to a touch screen     

266
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,631
and connects the power supply for the touch screen.      

267
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:04,903
he installs a stainless steel shelf on top, towards the front.             

268
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,237
he screws the front panel    

269
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,708
that houses the touch screen to the cabinet.         

270
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,910
he adds the top panel      

271
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,113
that the furnace chamber will sit on.           

272
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,049
he assembles the metal surround for the furnace chamber     

273
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,985
to the control cabinet,     

274
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,788
then slides the furnace chamber into place.           

275
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,127
moving to the open back, he wires the heating elements  

276
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,863
for power and inserts a temperature sensor       

277
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,666
into a hole in the center of the chamber.         

278
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,070
he assembles a connector block,             

279
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,205
which will relay the sensor signal        

280
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,209
to the controller.        

281
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:48,346
he encloses the back with another metal panel.    

282
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,883
the next technician hinges the door to the metal surround.            

283
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,618
the door is a metal structure  

284
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,223
that's filled with many layers of ceramic-fiber insulation.   

285
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,891
he lowers and raises the door  

286
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,561
to confirm that it operates smoothly.    

287
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:07,432
this metal cover is the finishing touch.     

288
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:13,371
he snaps it onto the door and secures it with screws.   

289
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,040
the laboratory furnace's thick, insulated chamber     

290
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,310
is ready to contain the extreme heat         

291
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,712
and maintain it.         

292
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,247
and these torrid conditions   

293
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,916
are ideal for quality-control testing.   

294
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,002
narrator: aerogels are the lightest solid materials   

295
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,604
on earth.            

296
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,139
they have nanosized pores that make it difficult      

297
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,542
for cold or hot air to penetrate.          

298
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,745
used to insulate the electronics of the mars rovers        

299
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,880
and to capture comet dust,    

300
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,117
aerogels are among the most fascinating materials.      

301
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,223
aerogels in shaped forms look almost like holograms.   

302
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,626
yet they feel like hard foam.  

303
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:12,430
it's why they are often called frozen smoke or solid smoke.   

304
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,432
making them starts with four ingredients --     

305
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,168
a chemical called tmos, methanol,         

306
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,771
concentrated ammonia, and water.             

307
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:26,243
the technician adds measured amounts of tmos and methanol   

308
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,446
to a beaker that has a magnetic stir bead  

309
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,848
at the bottom.          

310
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,449
he transfers the beaker     

311
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,919
to a device that generates a rotating magnetic field.    

312
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,654
this causes the bead in the bottle          

313
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,990
to evenly mix the ingredients.  

314
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,659
he pours the mixture into a larger beaker       

315
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,195
and adds specific amounts of water,            

316
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,398
additional methanol, and ammonia hydroxide.      

317
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,670
as the ingredients are blended, a chemical reaction occurs.   

318
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,274
the tmos and water react to form silica.      

319
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,875
the chemical reaction      

320
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,346
will also cause the mixture to become a gel.         

321
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:05,283
but before that happens,    
he quickly prepares the molds.  

322
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,953
he pours pure methanol over a plastic grid       

323
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,424
and arranges rectangular molds over the grid.          

324
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,359
he injects precise amounts of the silica gel mix      

325
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,961
into the molds          

326
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,964
and leaves them to gel.     

327
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:22,166
during this process, the methanol under the grid   

328
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:26,504
evaporates, preventing excessive drying of the gels.  

329
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,841
the mixture coagulates in just minutes,         

330
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,108
but it takes about a day     

331
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,379
for the gels to fully strengthen.       

332
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,782
he then soaks the silica gels in methanol baths repeatedly   

333
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,785
over a period of several days.  

334
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,254
the methanol seeps in the gel's pores        

335
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,190
to flush out impurities.     

336
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,660
the gel pores are so minuscule  

337
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,796
they can't be seen with the naked eye.       

338
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,534
the technician decants the used methanol into a container.    

339
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,337
he'll send it to a recycler to remove impurities,      

340
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,406
and this will allow it to be used again         

341
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:05,543
in the aerogel production process.             

342
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,678
after several days of soaking in methanol,     

343
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,548
the silica gels are purified.  

344
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,953
they're ready for a process   
known as supercritical drying.  

345
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:20,225
it's a process that will convert these silica gels into aerogels.            

346
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,228
a technician places the gels in a pressure vessel.      

347
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,165
he locks the heavy steel lid with 12 large bolts and nuts   

348
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,300
so it will hold tight against a pressure        

349
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:34,905
that's 100 times greater than  
that of the normal atmosphere.  

350
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,108
he connects the hose that delivers liquid       

351
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,377
and carbon dioxide to the vessel.          

352
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,248
the liquid carbon dioxide replaces the methanol      

353
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,250
in the gel's pores.       

354
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,785
they then heat and pressurize the gels     

355
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,789
until the carbon dioxide    
in them becomes supercritical.  

356
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,858
it's semiliquid, semigas.    

357
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,263
the supercritical carbon dioxide             

358
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:03,868
diffuses out without collapsing the gels' solid skeletons.    

359
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,004
this transforms the silica gels              

360
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:09,107
into transparent solids that are mostly air.       

361
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,880
to demonstrate the insulating properties    

362
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,682
of the nanosized pores,     

363
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,418
they aim a blowtorch under an aerogel         

364
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,287
with a peanut butter cup on the top.           

365
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,423
it doesn't melt.         

366
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,693
a technician then places the aerogel on a scale  

367
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,229
to confirm its incredible low density.           

368
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:35,366
this aerogel weighs less than a nickel.          

369
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,968
next, using a scoopula,     

370
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,304
which is a tool with a v-shaped dent,      

371
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:43,040
she breaks an aerogel into little pieces.       

372
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,309
she inserts the bits       

373
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:48,846
into a glass tube with a bulb at the base.     

374
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,982
she transfers the tube to a machine           

375
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,251
that measures how much nitrogen gas      

376
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,254
the aerogel bits take up at different pressures      

377
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,122
to determine the size of the pores           

378
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,459
and the surface area.      

379
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,395
aerogels can have other magical properties.    

380
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,930
to demonstrate,         

381
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:11,268
she rubs specially treated aerogel particles on her hands.             

382
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,205
she then plunges her hands into water.           

383
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:17,342
the aerogel particles act like waterproof gloves    

384
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:20,545
and repel the water.       

385
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,614
this water resistance makes aerogels useful      

386
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,817
for a variety of applications.  

387
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,018
they can be added to paint    

388
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,220
or other things to make them waterproof     

389
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:32,423
and add insulating properties.  

390
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:37,095
scientists continue to explore the potential of aerogels.    

391
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,897
a gossamer synthetic material that weighs almost nothing,   

392
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,034
there's a lot more to them than it may seem.
