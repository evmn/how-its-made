   discovery communications     

3
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,251
           narrator:            
   when world war ii ended,     

4
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,520
    an american manufacturer    
        of fighter jets         

5
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,188
 needed to land new business.   

6
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,525
 the factory employed the same  
  stretched-aluminum process    

7
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,060
    used for shaping aircraft   
             wings              

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,196
          and came up           
    with an aluminum canoe.     

9
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,799
      no fighting machine,      
the aluminum canoe is designed  

10
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,769
    for a peaceful day at the   
             lake.              

11
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,072
       among watercraft,        

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,143
     the aluminum canoe is      
   the strong, silent type.     

13
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:20,813
     it resists breaking and    
            cracking            
   when it comes up against a   
              rock              

14
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,282
     or any other underwater    
            object.             

15
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:27,687
  so this is one invention that 
               is               
      unlikely to sink into     
           oblivion.            

16
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,024
  aluminum itself is too soft   
    for canoe construction.     

17
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,160
   so metals like magnesium,    
     nickel, and silicone       

18
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,030
   have been added to give it   
     the needed strength.       

19
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,633
       factory employees        
   unwind the aluminum alloy    

20
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,768
      onto a work table.        

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,538
     using electric shears,     
    they cut it to length.      

22
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:49,375
   they lift the metal sheet    
          onto a mold           

23
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:53,179
 of of part of the canoe hull.  

24
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,181
      they clamp the metal      
     to a hydraulic system      

25
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,582
       and activate it.         

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,452
     it pulls and stretches     
   the aluminum-alloy sheet     

27
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:05,057
          to the mold,          
 and it conforms to its shape.  

28
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:08,394
     the molded sheet needs     
           trimming,            

29
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,997
      so they transfer it       
       to a work table,         

30
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,802
      and place a template      
  over the contoured section.   

31
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,339
   they clamp it into place.    

32
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,409
         with a scribe,         
      one of the workers        

33
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:27,279
       etches the pattern       
   onto the molded aluminum.    

34
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:33,819
    the team then transfers     
  the aluminum sheet to a jig   

35
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,090
    and cuts out the pattern    
 following the etched outline.  

36
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:46,098
   they shape and cut a second  
              part              
    exactly like the first.     

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,234
  the two symmetrical halves    

38
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,504
       will form the hull       
    of the aluminum canoe.      

39
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,840
   they bake the hull halves    
   at 390 degrees fahrenheit    

40
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,241
       for eight hours.         

41
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,577
      the heat strengthens      
         the aluminum           

42
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,714
   and adds rigidity to it.     

43
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:02,915
       out of the oven,         

44
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,052
      a member of the team      
    now aligns two halves.      

45
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,259
     it's a perfect match,      
    so he now lowers a large    
             clamp.             

46
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,594
    once in place, he turns a   
             crank              

47
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:19,732
     to pull the two parts      
      of the aluminum canoe     
           together.            

48
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,938
     now tightly, clamped,      

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,974
     he welds the two parts     
       along the bottom.        

50
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:32,611
        this joins them         
   with a water-tight seam.     

51
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,415
   with hand clamps, he tacks   
 the two rounded ends together  

52
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,950
        and welds here.         

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,821
     he links the end welds     
   to the one on the bottom,    

54
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,091
       and the result is        
one continuous leak-proof weld  

55
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,960
      from bow to stern.        

56
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,433
    next, the team positions    
       an aluminum keel         

57
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,370
    along the bottom seam.      

58
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,840
       they reinforce it        
    from the inside with the    
             t-bar.             

59
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,110
       they drive rivets        
   through the t-bar, hull,     

60
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,513
     and keel to secure the     
           assembly.            

61
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,050
          they install          
  substantial aluminum guards   

62
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,453
      on the bow and stern      
 using rivets to secure them.   

63
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,823
   these guards will protect    
        the end welds.          

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,463
   they brace the base of the   
              canoe             
        from the inside         

65
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,599
    with six aluminum ribs.     

66
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,071
   welded, riveted, and with a  
              good              
      support structure,        

67
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,141
      this aluminum canoe       
    has really taken shape.     

68
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:41,013
    they equip the rim of the   
              canoe             
    with aluminum gunnels,      

69
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:45,351
  pounding them with a rubber   
  mallet to improve the fit.    

70
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:49,421
      then a worker rolls       
 non-skid paint on the inside   

71
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:53,559
    so it won't become slick    
           when wet.            

72
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,095
           they bring           
  incandescent heat lamps in,   

73
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:01,967
  and the paint dries quickly   
       in the warm glow.        

74
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,104
     after just 30 minutes,     
       the paint is dry.        

75
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,306
     then it's time to see      
       if it will float.        

76
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,509
   they transfer the aluminum   
              canoe             
      to a tank of water.       

77
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,511
        they clamp a bar        
       across the canoe         

78
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,048
  to apply nearly 1,000 pounds  
        of pressure --          

79
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,184
      more than the weight      
        of two people.          

80
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:21,787
     they check for leaks,      
 especially around the rivets.  

81
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,389
        there are none.         

82
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:29,527
  crossbars and bench seating   
   complete the fabrication.    

83
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,597
      there's one last bit      
         of business,           

84
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,599
     and that's the company     
           insignia.            

85
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:39,872
      this aluminum canoe       
 is now ready for recreation.   

86
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:44,210
    10 hours in the making,     
 the fun has only just begun.   

87
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:03,828
  narrator: bowls have existed  
    for thousands of years.     

88
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,932
       very early bowls,        
 used to serve food or drink,   

89
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,834
   have been found in china,    
        ancient greece,         

90
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,238
         and in certain         
   north-american cultures.     

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,507
    modern bowls can be made    
 from a variety of materials,   

92
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,612
   such as ceramic, plastic,    
       metal, and wood.         

93
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,516
        wood bowls come         
   in many shapes and sizes.    

94
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:28,587
  many different kinds of wood  
    are used to make bowls,     

95
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,256
 such as rubberwood and teak.   

96
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,993
 acacia is also a type of wood  
      used to make bowls.       

97
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,931
    workers cut flat planks     
           of acacia            

98
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,466
  using a large circular saw.   

99
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:46,404
 the acacia was cut a few days  
  ago in nearby plantations.    

100
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,942
 planks are cut to thicknesses  
 required for bowl production   

101
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,944
   and pre-dried on pallets,    

102
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,348
          spaced apart          
  for better air circulation.   

103
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,153
       using a table saw,       
a worker cuts the wood planks,  

104
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,688
        now kiln-dried,         

105
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,425
    into pieces long enough     
    to make the bowl wall.      

106
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,227
      another worker uses       
      a tilted table saw        

107
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,364
        to cut the wood         
into shapes resembling a cone.  

108
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,633
   drying the wood eliminates   
             water              

109
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,770
   that might cause cracking    
           later on.            

110
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:22,240
   a worker trims the pieces,   
   giving them the angle they   
             need,              

111
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,078
         so the staves          
   can be rounded later on.     

112
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,650
    another worker smoothes     
 the rough side of the staves   

113
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,318
    with a spinning cutter.     

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,121
        this also helps         
    shape the wood pieces.      

115
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,994
   another employee lines up    
     the staves on a table      

116
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:45,397
     before applying glue.      

117
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,535
   she spreads a wood-binding   
              glue              
 onto the sides of the staves.  

118
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,072
          once they're          
 thoroughly covered with glue,  

119
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:56,842
 she begins assembling the bowl 
      by sticking the sides     
           together.            

120
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,813
   she assembles a few pieces   
          at a time,            

121
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,617
     handing them to another    
             worker,            
 who arranges the bowl's shape  

122
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,088
     by leaning the staves      
    against a center piece.     

123
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,958
    they continue the process   
              until             
 all the staves are in place.   

124
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,863
    then they'll squeeze the    
             staves             
       tightly together.        

125
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,367
  they stretch elastic bands    

126
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,170
       around the outside       
     of the eventual bowl.      

127
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,640
         the elastics,          
held in place by a steel ring,  

128
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,544
       squeeze the staves       
  firmly against each other.    

129
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:37,048
   with a hammer, she lightly   
              taps              
    the staves into place,      

130
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,385
   making sure they are flush   
      against each other.       

131
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,121
    she turns the bowl over     

132
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,923
    to make sure none of the    
             staves             
      around the top rim        

133
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,858
   are sticking out too far.    

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,394
   she then leaves the bowl to  
              dry.              

135
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,731
    about five hours later,     
   they remove the elastics     

136
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,601
   and, again, leave the bowl   
   to harden for a full day.    

137
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,605
     a template is attached     
     to the eventual bowl,      

138
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,143
   in order to cut a circular   
 opening for the bottom piece.  

139
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,346
 the template serves as a guide 
  during the cutting process.   

140
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,348
     a worker moves the bowl    
            around,             

141
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,151
 allowing the cutter to create  
    a perfectly sized hole      

142
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,486
     for the bottom section     
         of the bowl.           

143
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,755
           it's made            
  of the same kind of wood --   

144
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,690
     in this case, acacia.      

145
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,361
     a worker applies glue      

146
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,430
          to the edges          
     of the bottom hole...      

147
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,035
    ...and to the outer edge    
      of the round piece        

148
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,438
    that goes in the bottom     
         of the bowl.           

149
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,641
  he inserts the bottom plate   

150
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:41,580
 and uses a hammer to force it  
      firmly into place.        

151
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,648
      after another day of      
           hardening,           

152
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,852
    a worker places the bowl    
          in a lave.            

153
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:51,657
   with a variety of knives,    
    he begins shaving off the   
             wood.              

154
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,792
  he starts on the inside wall  
         of the bowl.           

155
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,329
         then he shaves         
   the outside of the bowl,     

156
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,733
  gradually giving it shape.    

157
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:05,904
    he then uses sandpaper to   
             smooth             
   the surface of the bowl.     

158
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:13,411
   another worker then uses a   
              lave              
   to sand the surface of the   
             bowl.              

159
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:18,150
      he makes the surface      
     as fine as possible.       

160
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:21,353
          he must have          
     a keen eye for detail      

161
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,557
   in order to make the bowl    
       surface perfect.         

162
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,293
        a worker sprays         
      a foodstuff varnish       

163
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,028
 onto the surface of the bowl.  

164
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,164
  several layers are applied    

165
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,702
   with drying and polishing    
        after each one.         

166
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:40,839
          if required,          
   a stain is also applied.     

167
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,575
      they place a sticker      
 identifying the manufacturer   

168
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,644
  on the bottom of the bowl.    

169
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,981
     a worker then packages     
        the wood bowl.          

170
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,252
     with the bowl secure,      
 the only thing tossed around   

171
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,954
    will be the ingredients     
        you put in it.          

172
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,205
   narrator: the minivan was    
    designed with families in   
             mind,              

173
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,607
          but it also           
     revolutionized travel      

174
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,809
  for people in wheelchairs.    

175
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,678
   retrofitted for wheelchair   
        accessibility,          

176
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,947
       the minivan offers       
    unprecedented mobility.     

177
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,151
  no need to wait for special   
   wheelchair transportation    

178
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,621
     when there's a minivan     
       in the driveway.         

179
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,360
       convert a minivan        
      and change a life.        

180
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,030
   a wheelchair-accessibility   
          conversion            

181
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:41,166
     offers the convenience     
      of a ride anytime.        

182
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:45,170
       from the outside,        
      the van will look no      
           different.           

183
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:49,107
 but inside, the modifications  
        will be major.          

184
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,576
    the total revamp starts     

185
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,647
 with the removal of the van's  
  middle and third-row seats.   

186
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,517
    they pull out the carpet    
    and completely strip the    
            vehicle             

187
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,286
      from the front seats      
         to the back.           

188
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,326
    underneath, a technician    
 saws off the exhaust system,   

189
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,861
        and disassembles        
     the rear suspension.       

190
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,598
    the entire undercarriage    
       behind the engine        

191
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,465
  is about to be reconfigured   

192
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,001
          to make way           
   for a new lowered floor.     

193
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:21,339
     the team also removes      
   the 20-gallon fuel tank.     

194
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,742
       they'll replace it       
 with one of the same capacity  

195
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,677
 to fit the new configuration.  

196
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,346
          they cut out          
   a large section of floor     

197
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,049
and relocate displaced wiring.  

198
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,221
       they're now ready        
      to roll the new floor     
           framework            

199
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,624
     into position below the    
            vehicle.            

200
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:43,628
      this steel structure      
   replaces the original one    

201
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,163
     and is strong enough       

202
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,833
    to support the additional   
             weight             
       of a wheelchair.         

203
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,569
   a motorized one can weigh    
    as much as four adults.     

204
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,307
 they slide the new steel floor 
       into the vehicle         

205
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,376
      and lower it into the     
           framework.           

206
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,780
         the new floor          
    is significantly lower      

207
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,648
    than the one the van came   
             with,              

208
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,918
      and it increases the      
           wheelchair           
     passenger's headroom       

209
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,987
   by about 10 to 15 inches.    

210
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,724
        after installing        
the new fuel tank, suspension,  

211
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:16,795
      and exhaust systems,      
 they return to the interior.   

212
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:21,600
  a technician fits and binds   
   carpet underpadding to the   
              van.              

213
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,803
     he installs the carpet     
         and clamps it          

214
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,206
   while the adhesive cures.    

215
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,610
    with the back of the van    
     rebuilt and carpeted,      

216
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,546
         they now ready         
     the wheelchair ramp.       

217
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,882
      a technician applies      
       a gritty material        

218
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,350
   with an adhesive backing.    

219
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,285
   he simply presses it to the  
              ramp              

220
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,421
        and smoothes out        
       any air bubbles.         

221
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:46,224
   this gritty material will    
    provide a slip-resistant    
            surface             

222
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,627
       for the wheelchair       
        to move across.         

223
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:54,066
    he attaches a handle...     

224
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,234
          and installs          
     two cable assemblies       

225
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,571

        running the cuts        
 just 90% of the way through.   

342
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,160
          these slots           
    make the plug flexible.     

343
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,497
   next, they drill a threaded  
              hole              
      through the center        

344
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,431
to the same depth as the slots  

345
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,969
       and wrap the edge        
 in polyethylene gasket tape.   

346
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,238
the tape smoothes the surface,  

347
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,307
 helping the plug glide easily  
      into the resonator.       

348
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,444
 then they thread a wing screw  
     into the center hole       

349
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,712
      and insert the plug       

350
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,714
     into the corresponding     
          resonator.            

351
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,449
     to tune the instrument     
        before playing,         

352
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,385
 you move the plug up or down   

353
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:58,389
   until the node is the exact  
              same              
    pitch as the key above.     

354
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,993
    then you turn the screw     
 to push the sections outward,  

355
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,395
 locking the plug in position.
