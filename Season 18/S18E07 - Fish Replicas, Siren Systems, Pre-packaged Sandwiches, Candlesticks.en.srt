00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,676
captions paid for by discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:55,387
narrator: it used to be that you stuffed and mounted that big catch.  

4
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,190
nowadays, catch-and-release is the norm,          

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,259
so the trend is to display replicas     

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:04,130
of the prize fish you caught, photographed, then set free.  

7
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,431
it's more humane, and you get to brag      

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,569
about the one that didn't get away until you let it.   

9
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,474
sports fishermen aren't the only buyers of fish replicas. 

10
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,410
marinas, seaquariums, and seafood restaurants    

11
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,080
also acquire them for display. 

12
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,749
while a replica is a humane alternative    

13
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,551
to mounting the real thing,  

14
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:29,355
one real fish does have to   
sacrifice his life for the cause

15
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:32,625
in order to make the mold from which the replicas are cast.  

16
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:35,027
the first step is to surround the dead fish  

17
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,762
in a mix of soil and dirt.   

18
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,365
to construct the first half of the mold,  

19
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,568
the artist builds the mix-up to the halfway point,     

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,837
then rinses the surface clean. 

21
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,839
next, using molding plaster,  

22
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,910
he forms a ledge all around the fish and under the fins.  

23
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,246
he positions six to eight tabs 

24
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,916
that will help align the two mold halves.   

25
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,250
once the plaster hardens,   

26
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:02,455
he pins the fins steady and pours on gelcoat resin.  

27
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,390
this material picks up the scales      

28
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,892
and other intricate details.  

29
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:13,199
once the gelcoat cures, he removes the pins,      

30
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,801
then covers the surface in fiberglass resin      

31
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,071
and over that, shredded fiberglass cloth.   

32
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,948
then he applies another coat of fiberglass resin,      

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,886
ensuring the cloth is thoroughly saturated.    

34
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,156
once the resin hardens,    

35
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,825
he flips the fish to the other side...      

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,829
...breaks off the plaster,   

37
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,298
and repeats all the previous steps     

38
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,201
to construct the second half of the mold.  

39
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:56,642
after about four hours of labor,
the mold is finally finished. 

40
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,311
the mold maker removes the fish

41
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,214
and washes the now vacant cavity.     

42
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:07,987
now the team can begin casting the replicas.

43
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,590
they wax the cavity to prevent sticking.      

44
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,527
then they apply white gelcoat resin,      

45
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,962
which picks up all the fine details.     

46
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,467
with a handheld chopping gun, 

47
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,172
they lay down a layer of shredded fiberglass cloth. 

48
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,276
they apply resin putty along the perimeter of the cavity   

49
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,512
on each mold half.       

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,150
using the alignment tabs,   

51
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,420
they close and clamp the mold halves together.   

52
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,224
once the putty sets, they remove the clamps,    

53
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:49,428
open the mold, and extract the fiberglass replica.    

54
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,133
using a jigsaw, they cut out the fish's mouth. 

55
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,038
then via the mouth, they fill the hollow interior 

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,441
with expanding polyurethane foam.       

57
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,579
the hard foam provides a solid base     

58
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,981
against which to sculpt the fish's mouth   

59
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,250
and set its eyes, fins, and gill.           

60
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,922
with a jigsaw again, they remove
all the excess foam...     

61
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:22,161
...then, with a disk sander, sand the rough edges smooth.  

62
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:26,732
next, they glue a glass eye on each side of the head    

63
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,202
and, using resin putty, set the side and bottom fins, 

64
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:33,739
which they had removed at   
one point and molded separately.

65
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,877
they epoxy teeth into the mouth.

66
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,346
the mold maker used the real fish teeth    

67
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,947
to make a rubber mold.     

68
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,949
then, using that mold,     

69
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,185
he cast this replica set of teeth in plastic.      

70
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:55,427
now they'll bring the fish to life with color.  

71
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,696
first, using a paint gun,   

72
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,231
they apply a coat of gray primer.     

73
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:03,035
once that dries, they apply a white base coat, 

74
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,538
followed by a coat of silver. 

75
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,507
with an airbrush,       

76
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,243
an artist paints the subtle shades and markings 

77
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,013
that make this fake fish look so incredibly real.    

78
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,989
the finishing touch --     

79
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,592
they paint a piece of cardboard red,   

80
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:30,095
cut it into the shape of a gill,
then glue it in place.     

81
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,000
after 45 hours of casting and painting,    

82
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,738
this prized catch is ready for display.     

83
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:58,090
narrator: siren systems were first widely used during world war ii

84
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,559
to warn of possible air attacks.

85
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,494
early on, that wailing effect 

86
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,097
was generated by forcing air against a perforated disk.   

87
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,169
today's siren sounds      
emanate from higher-tech systems

88
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:13,171
and still mean trouble is on its way.     

89
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,040
[ siren wailing ]       

90
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,242
from atop towers and buildings,

91
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,179
siren systems warn surrounding communities  

92
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:24,250
of impending tornadoes, floods,
or any calamity.        

93
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:25,717
today's sirens         

94
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,456
can broadcast both warning tones
and live voice messages.    

95
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,258
they can also be activated by remote control       

96
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,593
from anywhere in the world.  

97
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,329
the messages and warning tones from a typical system     

98
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:40,733
can be heard from almost half a mile away. 

99
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,735
[ siren wailing ]       

100
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:46,338
production begins with the   
transformers for the amplifiers.

101
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,274
a worker winds thick, insulated copper wires 

102
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,009
around a plastic bobbin    

103
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:54,212
to produce the transformer's primary coil.

104
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,149
she compresses the wires to eliminate gaps.       

105
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,753
a tight winding is critical for generating a magnetic field

106
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,822
and transferring it to a secondary coil.      

107
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:07,292
she wraps insulating tape around the primary coil.    

108
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,961
she winds thin wire over it  

109
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:11,896
to produce the narrower secondary coil,  

110
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,566
and she encases that in more insulating tape.    

111
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,701
next, with swift dexterity,  

112
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,905
an employee stacks e-shaped iron insulators

113
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:24,443
in the center of the bobbin to build a core.        

114
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,378
she inserts smaller iron insulators    

115
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,847
between the e-shaped ones,   

116
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,183
and this tightens up the pack. 

117
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,920
she taps them into place and now has a dense iron core 

118
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,189
that will aid the flow of energy
between the transformer coils. 

119
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,726
with an enamel coating baked on

120
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,262
and the assembly wired for sound,        

121
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,265
this siren transformer is now complete.        

122
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,800
a computer-operated machine  

123
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,869
now punch-cuts assembly holes in an aluminum panel      

124
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,540
that will be used for a section of the siren cabinet.

125
00:07:55,542 --> 00:08:00,145
a robot transfers the panel to a computerized bending machine.

126
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,948
another robot feeds the panel to a clamping bar       

127
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,883
and, using hydraulic might,  

128
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,554
bends it against the clamp in strategic locations.    

129
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,088
this transforms it       

130
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,092
into a section of the siren's back and sidewalls.

131
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,960
it also folds the edges,    

132
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,431
creating flanges for the cabinet-door assembly. 

133
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,101
this computerized system    

134
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:25,371
takes less than a minute to complete all these folds.  

135
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:31,510
the robot then         
transfers the siren-cabinet part

136
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,777
to a conveyor,         

137
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,382
and it's on to the next station
for assembly.         

138
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:40,853
ahead, some cabinet brackets are in the wash zone.     

139
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,988
as the parts travel through,  

140
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,725
they get a soapy spray and then a rinse.       

141
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,530
after drying, the parts head into a powder-paint booth.

142
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,467
sprayers apply dry powder paint
to the surface of the parts.  

143
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:59,070
it takes eight automated guns and two manually operated ones 

144
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,874
to evenly coat these brackets. 

145
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,743
the paint is electrostatically charged to cling to the metal, 

146
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,548
but at this point can be rubbed off like dust.  

147
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,352
baking it causes the particles to melt and bond to the surface

148
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,755
for a smooth and very tough paint job.   

149
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:21,226
this worker now installs the siren system's control board. 

150
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,096
it regulates the siren's six tones,     

151
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:28,400
16 prerecorded messages,    
and the public-address function.

152
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:33,572
he bolts it to the inside of the cabinet door.      

153
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,574
next up is an amplifier    

154
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,510
equipped with the transformer we saw assembled earlier    

155
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,580
and the amplifier board.    

156
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,250
he installs the completed amplifier in the cabinet    

157
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,586
and connects it to the control board.     

158
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,189
there are five amplifiers in this siren system --    

159
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,724
one for each speaker on the tower.         

160
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,395
he equips it with a control pad
for on-site activation.    

161
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,997
then a 1,650-ton press     

162
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,000
injects hot liquid plastic into molds.          

163
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,402
in seconds, the plastic cools, 

164
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,873
and the press retracts     
to reveal the new speaker parts.

165
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,341
they bolt the speaker halves together,  

166
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,345
install the screen through which the siren sound emanates,

167
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,881
and top it off with a plastic cap.      

168
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,949
they install a 400-watt driver 

169
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,086
in each section of the siren's speakers.    

170
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,690
the more speakers there are atop the siren tower,     

171
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,291
the greater the reach.     

172
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,827
the most powerful can be heard many miles away. 

173
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,697
emergency vehicles       

174
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,099
are equipped with smaller versions of these systems   

175
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,434
to warn motorists of their speedy approach,   

176
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,705
and the concept is basically the same --    

177
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,307
to get your instant attention. 

178
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,610
[ siren wailing ]       

179
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,658
narrator: in today's hustle-and-bustle world,    

180
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,194
it's not uncommon to forgo brown-bagging it   

181
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:05,330
and instead to grab a meal on the go.   

182
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,666
it's not surprising to see that food retailers,  

183
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,069
from mega supermarkets to tiny convenience stores,  

184
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,240
carry prepackaged sandwiches for
the hungry-in-a-hurry customer. 

185
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,313
ham and cheese,        

186
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,283
cheese and tomato, chicken salad --        

187
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,618
just a few of the many sandwich varieties 

188
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,153
you can buy ready-made.    

189
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,089
retail customers specify which ingredients they want  

190
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,557
in their sandwich order,    

191
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,493
and the factory sets up the assembly lines accordingly.

192
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:39,831
the first step is to load fresh 
bread into an automated machine.

193
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,968
while doing so,        
they visually inspect the slices

194
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,305
and remove any with holes or other flaws.   

195
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,573
the machine separates the slices
in the loaf.          

196
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,842
then, because this sandwich requires it,   

197
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,178
an internal roller spreads melted butter.     

198
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,648
the machine then        
drops the buttered slices faceup

199
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,251
onto the belt that moves through the production line,  

200
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,053
where first, an automated depositor     

201
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,789
squirts on the quantity and type of mayonnaise     

202
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,459
the customer requested.    

203
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,262
workers manually lay on the more specific ingredients, 

204
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:15,334
such as cold cuts or grated cheddar cheese.   

205
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,204
in the prep area,       

206
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,342
workers load logs of ham into a slicer.

207
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,943
the customer has specified the size and weight      

208
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,413
of the slices it wants in the sandwich,   

209
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,617
and the factory        
programs the slicer accordingly.

210
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:39,691
the slices go off to the assembly line,     

211
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,728
where workers add them to the sandwiches.  

212
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:55,540
next, they close up the sandwiches. 

213
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,682
they stack the sandwiches in piles of two.        

214
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,520
the belt then brings the sandwiches   

215
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,455
to a mechanized cutter.    

216
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,728
the cutter works like a reciprocating saw,

217
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,531
the vertical blade oscillating at high speed   

218
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,134
as the sandwich travels through it.      

219
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:24,069
the stacked halves on each side

220
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,538
will be packaged together as one sandwich.        

221
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,674
some of the sandwich varieties 

222
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,743
produced in the largest quantities   

223
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,179
are made on a fully automated assembly line.         

224
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,951
a robot suctions up bread slices

225
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,221
and places them on a moving belt.       

226
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,097
positioning plates descend and adjust the slices 

227
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,168
so that they'll be perfectly centered under the nozzles,   

228
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,371
which dispense the sandwich ingredients.   

229
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,978
in production here, egg-salad sandwiches.     

230
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,515
a nozzle deposits a set quantity
of chopped egg with mayonnaise 

231
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,118
on every second slice.     

232
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,794
at the next station,      

233
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,197
robotic arms lined with suction cups    

234
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,732
grab the empty slices     

235
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,835
and flip them over onto the filled slices.    

236
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,338
next stop, an ultrasonic knife.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,209
it slices the sandwiches in two

238
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:41,279
using vibrations produced by high-frequency sound waves. 

239
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,416
this cutting method gives a cleaner edge.     

240
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,153
next, robotic arms pick up half of each sandwich, 

241
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,957
spin it around, and stack it onto the other half.      

242
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,361
a robot grabs four finished sandwiches at a time 

243
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,231
and puts them in triangular, plastic trays, 

244
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,734
which then move on to the sealing and labeling stations. 

245
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,978
back on the semi-automated assembly line, 

246
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,448
workers stack the sandwiches manually 

247
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,715
and place them         

248
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,520
in individual plastic-lined cardboard packages.      

249
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,325
a conveyor belt brings them to a machine,   

250
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,662
which pushes down the top flap and heat-seals it shut.    

251
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:36,400
the sandwiches hit store shelves
within 12 hours of production. 

252
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,671
they stay fresh for an additional three days, 

253
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:43,608
after which the sandwich company
removes the unsold ones    

254
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,112
while making its daily delivery
of new ones.          

255
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,627
narrator: before the invention of electrical lighting,    

256
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,896
candlesticks were household essentials.   

257
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:09,167
they often had shiny flanges to
reflect the light of the flame 

258
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,902
and throw the glow farther.  

259
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,838
necessity may have been the reason for their invention,

260
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,309
but candlesticks soon evolved into a thing of beauty.    

261
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,980
with their elegant curves,   

262
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,917
these pewter candlesticks add a touch of class to any decor. 

263
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,721
top them off with lit candles, and the ambiance improves,   

264
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,990
which is why people still use candlesticks 

265
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,593
to both decorate and illuminate.

266
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,662
this candlestick starts with a flat pewter disk.

267
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,398
the worker stamps the company insignia onto it. 

268
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,466
he loads the stamped disk into a lathe          

269
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,470
against a flared form known as the chuck --     

270
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:49,274
a kind of template       
for the base of the candlestick.

271
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,743
he rubs a wax-like lubricant onto the pewter        

272
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,144
to reduce friction,      

273
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:57,616
while he works the metal as it spins very fast on the lathe.  

274
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,018
he exerts a fair amount of pressure   

275
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,552
with a finger-shaped tool   

276
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:05,423
to make the pewter conform to the shape of the chuck.   

277
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,025
this process is called spinning.

278
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,961
it takes a series of passes with the tool         

279
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,696
to transform the flat disk   

280
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,499
into the basic shape of a candlestick base.     

281
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,036
he trims the bottom to make the part perfectly level. 

282
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,438
now, with a wooden dowel,   

283
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,574
he rolls the bottom of the candlestick base    

284
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,643
to make it more substantial.  

285
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,445
the base now complete, he sets it aside.       

286
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:31,249
he now works a smaller pewter disk against a different chuck 

287
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,719
to shape the candlestick top, which is called the bobeche.  

288
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,789
he flares the bobeche, creating a flange       

289
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,259
to reflect candlelight and catch wax drippings.    

290
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,995
using the chuck, pictured on the left,     

291
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,998
he's produced a stylish candlestick top.   

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
to make the candlestick post, 

293
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,070
the next worker melts pewter and skims off the impurities. 

294
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,407
he pours the molten pewter into a mold,          

295
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,542
and it solidifies quickly.   

296
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,145
he drains the remaining liquid pewter  

297
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,481
and opens the mold, revealing a hollow post    

298
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,052
that matches the top and base of the candlestick.      

299
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,088
pewter is also hardened in the channel    

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,690
through which it was poured.  

301
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:17,028
this extra material, called sprue, will be removed later. 

302
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,434
over at the next station,   

303
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,837
a worker removes a seam-like ridge   

304
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,973
created where the parts of the mold came together.   

305
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,210
he scrapes and files the ridge to even the surface.      

306
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,115
on the left,          
you can see the candlestick post

307
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,183
before the ridge removal.   

308
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,453
and this is the part afterward.

309
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:45,724
another worker now slices off the sprue ends with a band saw,

310
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,959
leaving the post design intact.

311
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:55,800
the pewter sprues will be remelted and reused.  

312
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,740
next, the worker clamps the post into position, 

313
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,211
and a paddle drill bores    
into one end and then the other.

314
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,747
it slopes the lip of the casting inward,     

315
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,548
creating a chamfered edge   

316
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,618
that will connect neatly    
to the candlestick top and base.

317
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,425
he slides a rod through the casting      

318
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,759
to better grip the part    

319
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,230
as he presses it against a fine-grit sand belt. 

320
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,900
the sanding process removes scuffs and scrapes,  

321
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,403
and the result is satiny-smooth.

322
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,106
now it's time for this pewter candlestick  

323
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,841
to come together.       

324
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,778
he places the post on the candlestick top     

325
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,180
and solders them together.   

326
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,048
the tin-alloy solder wire melts

327
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,318
and acts like hot glue to bond the two parts.     

328
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:53,191
he moves the candlestick base into position.         

329
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,863
he dips the open end of the cast post into a flux substance

330
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,467
to prepare the surface and transfers it to the base. 

331
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,538
as he solders the two, he taps the post with the torch

332
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,608
to realign it when it slips a bit.      

333
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,844
then he continues soldering.  

334
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,682
he now dips the completed candlestick in soapy water.  

335
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,721
this removes flux residue and hardens the solder bond.  

336
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,824
for a highly polished finish, 

337
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:29,360
he presses the candlestick against a spinning cotton wheel

338
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,829
that rubs a special compound onto it.  

339
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,700
it's a shinier alternative   
to the satin-pewter candlestick,

340
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,169
and the effect is similar to silver.     

341
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:45,043
when it comes to candlesticks, two are always better than one,

342
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,912
so it's time to pair them up. 

343
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,181
together, they'll really shine.

344
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,128
