00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,824
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,560
         steel safes...         

3
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,295
         false teeth...         

4
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,431
          airplanes...          

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,067
        and maple syrup.        

6
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,372
      the first bank safes      

7
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,575
  were made of wood reinforced  
        with sheet iron.        

8
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,777
       thieves would just       
        smash them open.        

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,979
         then came safes        
       made of solid iron.      

10
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,049
thieves would just blow them up.

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,886
but then, to the crooks' dismay,
    came safes made of steel.   

12
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,726
    it all starts with sheets   
         of solid steel         

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,928
    up to 1 1/2 inches thick    

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,734
  and an automated machine with 
 an oxygen-and-gas-fueled flame.

15
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,936
      the flame slowly cuts     
           the plates           

16
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,605
    that will form the walls    
          of the safe.          

17
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,775
    the cutting creates gases   
   that are doused with water.  

18
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,547
 a welder with a manual version 
        of the same flame       

19
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,818
       frees up the plates      
      with a few last cuts.     

20
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,826
   then, using a large magnet,  
     they stack the plates.     

21
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,293
       each one is labeled      

22
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,097
    so the workers will know    
 in what order to assemble them.

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,166
  they're assembled by a welder 

24
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,968
    who uses a machine called   
          a mig welder.         

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,173
    the welding wire is made    
  of several different metals.  

26
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,009
 it rolls off a spool as needed.

27
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,723
    elsewhere in the factory,   

28
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,592
    a semiautomatic saw cuts    
       flat bars of steel.      

29
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,661
 these bars will form the frame 

30
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,597
       that will surround       
       the steel plates.        

31
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,338
   meanwhile, another machine,  
        called a turret,        

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,341
       fashions steel bars      
        into moving parts       

33
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,111
    for the locking mechanism   
      and also into hinges.     

34
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,752
        that milky liquid       
         is a lubricant.        

35
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,622
 normally, you see raw material 
    move on an assembly line    

36
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,291
       from tool to tool.       

37
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,159
   this is just the opposite.   

38
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,096
     the steel bar stays on     
the turret from start to finish.

39
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,266
     the tools come and go.     

40
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:19,731
  workers take pieces of sheet  
 metal cut into shapes by laser 

41
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:24,236
and bend them in a press to make
  various parts and mechanisms. 

42
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,691
   meanwhile, the large steel   
     plates they cut earlier    

43
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:51,263
    go into a hydraulic press   
  to make them perfectly flat.  

44
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,035
    it's finally time to put    
  all the components together.  

45
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,704
    they construct the frame    
       in an assembly jig,      

46
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,375
     then insert the plates     
 for the sides, top, and bottom.

47
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:07,813
   using the mig welder again,  
 they fuse the pieces together. 

48
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,652
    they measure the angles,    

49
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:18,389
     then use a giant clamp     
       to square the safe.      

50
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,593
 finally, they install the plate
    for the back of the safe    

51
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,129
      and weld the joints.      

52
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,342
   they stand the safe upright  

53
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:41,179
and grind down the welding lines
      until they're smooth.     

54
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,419
   this factory also produces   
 what's called a composite safe,

55
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,689
     made of soft materials     
    such as copper, aluminum,   

56
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,357
      and low-grade steel.      

57
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,493
    but it has a cement core,   

58
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,762
        making this safe        
     harder to break in to.     

59
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,099
     the finished safe gets     
     three coats of paint.      

60
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,834
     then, in the finishing     
           department,          

61
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,103
   they install the mechanical  
       or electronic locks      

62
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,305
     and locking mechanisms,    

63
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,307
     as well as the internal    
      time-lock mechanism.      

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,710
   the time lock allows access  
           to the safe          

65
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,644
  only at certain times of day, 

66
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,647
such as a bank's business hours.

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,917
      even if someone picks     
 the outside combination locks, 

68
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,988
       the door won't open      
    outside those set hours.    

69
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,465
   narrator: the machines that  
  sterilize medical instruments 

70
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:37,469
       use ethylene oxide,      
       a highly toxic gas.      

71
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,337
    now there's a new method    

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,274
  that's safer, more effective, 
       and less expensive.      

73
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:46,678
   this new machine uses ozone  
    as the sterilizing agent.   

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,548
   ozone is a form of oxygen.   

75
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:59,224
  until the 1800s, false teeth  
were made of animal bone, ivory,

76
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,159
     or actual human teeth.     

77
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,829
   they came from poor people,  
      who sold their teeth,     

78
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,965
      and from dead bodies.     

79
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,634
        today's dentures        
      are usually ceramic.      

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,176
      they start by heating     
  a sheet of wax over a flame.  

81
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,445
          they press it         
   onto a rough plaster model   

82
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,712
     of the patient's mouth,    

83
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,381
     sent in by the dentist.    

84
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,650
     the lab technicians use    
           this model           

85
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,387
    to prepare what's called    
       an impression tray,      

86
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,922
    what the dentist will use   
      to make a rubber mold     

87
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,790
      to cast the dentures.     

88
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:37,195
 they apply an acrylic material 
      over the wax lining,      

89
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:41,032
 forming a handle so they'll be 
 able to remove it afterwards.  

90
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,734
    once the acrylic hardens,   

91
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,072
  they pull it out of the model 
      and discard the wax.      

92
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,808
     the dentist fills this     
  new acrylic tray with rubber  

93
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,677
   to take a final impression.  

94
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,679
the lab uses the hardened rubber

95
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,882
       as a negative mold       
     of the patient's mouth.    

96
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,618
    they fill it with plaster   

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,821
         to make a new,         
   more precise plaster model.  

98
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,959
   then they use the new model  
to make the part of the dentures

99
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,062
        that fits on top        
     of the patient's gums.     

100
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,766
        they take special       
       orthodontic acrylic      

101
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,501
   and press it into the model  

102
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,836
      to form what's called     
         the baseplate.         

103
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,574
  then they heat a sheet of wax 
   to form a rim on the base.   

104
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,576
 this new acrylic-and-wax model 

105
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,379
    now goes back for another   
 fitting in the patient's mouth.

106
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,982
   the dentist takes a series   
         of measurements        

107
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,051
     to show the lab exactly    
    where to place the teeth.   

108
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,053
 the model goes back to the lab,

109
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,389
    where technicians select    
            the teeth           

110
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,660
   that'll best suit the size   
     of the patient's mouth.    

111
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,265
  they install the teeth one by 
  one into the model's wax rim. 

112
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,135
    then they send the model    
       back to the dentist      

113
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,536
     for the final fitting.     

114
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,206
       the dentist checks       
   that everything is centered  

115
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,108
   and that the patient's bite  
      is properly aligned.      

116
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,102
     if the model fits well     
         and looks good,        

117
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,173
    the lab can finally begin   
  to manufacture the dentures.  

118
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,977
   they position the model in   
a special holder called a flask,

119
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,311
      then attach channels      

120
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,847
      through which acrylic     
     will later be injected.    

121
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,118
  this acrylic will replace the 
 wax holding the teeth in place.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,253
           but first,           
     to get rid of the wax,     

123
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:47,458
they have to cast a plaster mold
   to hold the teeth in place.  

124
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,726
     once the plaster dries,    

125
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,262
  they submerge it in hot water 
        for five minutes        

126
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,565
     to melt the wax inside.    

127
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,273
   they rinse the plaster mold  
         with warm water        

128
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,141
   to remove any wax residues.  

129
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,744
  then they apply what's called 
          a separator,          

130
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,813
           a chemical           
   that will keep the acrylic   

131
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,948
          from sticking         
     to the plaster mold --     

132
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,819
   just like greasing the pan   
       when you're baking.      

133
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,557
   they position a cylinder of  
  acrylic right over the flask. 

134
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,691
  using an air-pressure piston, 

135
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,029
     they force the acrylic     
     into the plaster mold.     

136
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,169
    they submerge the mold in   
  boiling water for 35 minutes  

137
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,138
     to harden the acrylic.     

138
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,181
 once the flask has cooled down,
     they break the plaster.    

139
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,985
the false teeth are now securely
     rooted in acrylic gums.    

140
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,921
      a bit of finishing,       
      and they'll be done.      

141
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,872
   an ultrasonic bath gets rid  
    of any remaining plaster.   

142
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,611
     they polish the acrylic    
          with pumice,          

143
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,681
        then shine it up        
   with a polishing compound.   

144
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,290
     the set of false teeth     
        is finally ready.       

145
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,160
   when a patient doesn't need  
     a full set of dentures,    

146
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,294
        just a few teeth,       

147
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,430
     they get what's called     
          a partial --          

148
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,832
     made much the same way,    

149
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:38,103
   but hooked on at either end  
 to the patient's natural teeth.

150
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,446
   narrator: aviation was once  
      the exclusive domain      

151
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,848
          of commercial         
      and military pilots.      

152
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,117
          not anymore.          

153
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,253
     today many amateurs get    
      their pilot's license     

154
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,922
      and take to the skies     
        in light aircraft       

155
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,493
not for a job, but for the sheer
       pleasure of flying.      

156
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,333
      to construct the body     
    of these light aircraft,    

157
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,601
           they start           
    with two types of cloth,    

158
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,072
 one woven from glass fibers -- 
          fiberglass --         

159
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,140
  the other from carbon fibers. 

160
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,877
  carbon is a chemical element  
  that's stronger than steel.   

161
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,614
    both materials go through   
      a laminating machine      

162
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,283
         that coats them        
      with an epoxy resin.      

163
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,560
  to begin forming the various  
  parts that make up the body,  

164
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,364
      workers lay strips of     
the laminated fabric into molds.

165
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,433
  the engineering plans dictate 

166
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,303
     the precise positioning    
         of the strips,         

167
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,839
        which is critical       
  for strength and durability.  

168
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,475
 they lay in carbon-fiber cloth 

169
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,777
     where they need to have    
         extra strength         

170
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,245
   without additional weight,   

171
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,847
      areas such as this --     

172
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,917
    the passenger compartment   
         of the cockpit.        

173
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,384
      to make the fuselage,     

174
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,122
    they sandwich a foam core   
    less than 1/2 inch thick    

175
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,258
       between two layers       
    of the fiberglass cloth.    

176
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,763
     the foam also insulates    
 against heat, cold, and noise. 

177
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,801
     workers coat the edges     
     and joints with resin,     

178
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,837
       filling any voids.       

179
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,142
       once all the fabric      
         is in the mold,        

180
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,077
   it's time to vacuum-bag it.  

181
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,213
  first, they cover everything  

182
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,148
          with a layer          
     of perforated plastic,     

183
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,951
   then with a breather cloth,  

184
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,553
        which looks like        
      a white wool blanket.     

185
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,389
    then comes another layer    
           of plastic.          

186
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,568
      they attach a vacuum      
    to suck out all the air.    

187
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,106
 the excess resin exits through 
 the tiny holes in the plastic  

188
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,508
            and soaks           
    into the breather cloth.    

189
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,579
 now that the mold is airtight, 
      it can begin to cure.     

190
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:06,050
   they put it into an oven at  
 40 degrees celsius for 8 hours.

191
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,186
       once the molds come      
        out of the oven,        

192
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,122
         workers install        
     the internal structure.    

193
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,525
then, using the same epoxy resin
        they used earlier       

194
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,996
   to laminate the fiberglass   
   and carbon-fiber fabrics,    

195
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,532
   they bond the tail's upper   
   and lower shells together.   

196
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,668
        they do the same        
        with the wings.         

197
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,070
   the parts are left to cure   
           overnight.           

198
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,540
 the next day, they finally come
        out of the molds.       

199
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,676
    next stop, the trim shop.   

200
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,012
         workers remove         
      the excess fiberglass     

201
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,880
    and cut out the windows.    

202
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,166
        the parts go back       
       for a final curing.      

203
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,870
 the oven is around 175 degrees.

204
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,709
         18 hours later,        
   out they come for painting.  

205
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:09,113
 workers sand the parts and coat
   them with an epoxy primer.   

206
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,316
the finish coat is polyurethane,

207
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,385
    which resists weathering.   

208
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,588
           meanwhile,           
     other workers assemble     

209
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,389
  and test various components,  

210
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,592
 such as the electrical system. 

211
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,863
   a computer guides a machine  
   to cut all the metal parts,  

212
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,664
  such as the instrument panel. 

213
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,533
       the cutting machine      
      doesn't have a blade,     

214
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,069
 but rather a sand-and-water jet

215
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,339
     that's powerful enough     
     to cut through metal.      

216
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,617
   a certified aircraft welder  
   prepares the engine mount,   

217
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,220
     the base that will hold    
      the engine in place.      

218
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,122
            it's made           
   of high-grade carbon steel.  

219
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,961
  at the final assembly stage,  
   workers install the engine   

220
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:00,899
 and other previously assembled 
 components into the fuselage.  

221
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,369
   workers position the wiring  
          and plumbing,         

222
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,037
       then hook them up.       

223
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,705
  they screw on the wing tips,  

224
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,641
       which already have       
   their navigational lights.   

225
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:15,379
an avionics technician powers up
the airplane for the first time 

226
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,082
  to function-test everything.  

227
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,855
the final inspection takes place
    where it really counts --   

228
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,724
           in flight.           

229
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,804
            narrator:           
  how do maple trees make sap?  

230
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,940
     they accumulate starch     
  during their growing season.  

231
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,744
  with the spring thaw, enzymes 
transform the starch into sugar.

232
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,079
   when the trees absorb water  
      through their roots,      

233
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,816
    it mixes with that sugar    
          to make sap.          

234
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,692
    long before the white man   
     came to north america,     

235
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,296
   the native indians revered   
         the maple tree.        

236
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,833
 in early spring, they'd pierce 
   its trunk with a tomahawk,   

237
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,369
     then place a wood chip     
         under the hole         

238
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,238
       to channel the sap       
     into a bark container.     

239
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,243
    then they boiled the sap    
    over a fire in clay pots.   

240
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:24,115
  the indians introduced maple  
 syrup to the european settlers.

241
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,718
 today most producers use tubing
    instead of sap buckets --   

242
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,956
    no more trudging through    
   the snow from tree to tree.  

243
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,268
     the time to collect sap    
     is in the early spring,    

244
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,137
      when the maple trees      
        are still dormant       

245
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,074
 and when the temperature hits  
 3 or 4 degrees above freezing. 

246
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,744
the freeze-and-thaw cycle alters
  the pressure inside the tree  

247
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,147
   and starts the sap flowing.  

248
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,816
         the first step         
      is to tap the trees.      

249
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,953
   they drill a hole 1/2 inch   
          in diameter,          

250
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,554
         2 inches deep,         

251
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,558
   then gently insert a spout   
   made of metal or plastic.    

252
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,961
  it's important not to damage  
            the bark.           

253
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,630
  that not only harms the tree  

254
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:17,501
  but also lets air in the sap, 
     which ruins the flavor.    

255
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,771
     you don't see too many     
   sap buckets around anymore.  

256
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,774
       today sap is pumped      
   through polyethylene tubes   

257
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,644
  to larger collector tubes...  

258
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,180
 then into the pumping station. 

259
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:34,918
       sap is 97.5% water       
      and only 2.5% sugar.      

260
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,321
 to transform the sap to syrup, 

261
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,924
   they have to boil it down.   

262
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,992
   it takes 35 gallons of sap   

263
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,829
     to make just one gallon    
            of syrup.           

264
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,867
     when the tank fills up,    

265
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,004
 the sap is automatically pumped
       to the sugar house       

266
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,339
  into a stainless-steel tank.  

267
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:59,743
 the more advanced producers use
      a specialized machine     

268
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,948
   that partially concentrates  
   the sap by reverse osmosis.  

269
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,217
     this more than triples     
  the sap's natural sugar level 

270
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,288
     and means they'll have     
       less boiling to do.      

271
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,424
    from there, the sap flows   
       to the evaporator.       

272
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,095
        they heat the sap       
      to the boiling point      

273
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,430
       and keep it boiling      
      however long it takes     

274
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,633
 to evaporate 66% of the water. 

275
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,303
     if the water evaporates    
   too slowly or too quickly,   

276
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,774
    that'll adversely affect    
 the color, flavor, and texture 

277
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,175
          of the syrup.         

278
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:35,313
   however -- and here's where  
   expertise is everything --   

279
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,848
  there's no set cooking time.  

280
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,251
           experienced          
      maple-sugar producers     

281
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,387
    can tell when it's ready    
     just by looking at it.     

282
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,761
 they test the sugar level using
  a device called a hydrotherm. 

283
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,273
  when the syrup is just right, 

284
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,475
       they run it through      
        a pressure filter       

285
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,012
   to remove calcium residues   
      and other impurities.     

286
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,819
      they store the syrup      
    in steam-cleaned barrels.   

287
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:19,490
the lab at the central warehouse
 tests a sample from each drum. 

288
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,559
using sophisticated instruments,

289
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,429
 technicians classify the color 
    from dark to extra light.   

290
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,098
  they also assess the quality. 

291
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,568
        lower-grade syrup       
     is for industrial use,     

292
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,270
          higher-grade          
     for the retail market.     

293
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,706
   they pasteurize the syrup,   

294
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,576
      then put it into huge     
 stainless-steel storage tanks. 

295
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,513
   the tanks are vacuum-sealed  
     with a nitrogen barrier    

296
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:46,984
to preserve the flavor and color
  and to prevent fermentation.  

297
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,321
     it also keeps the syrup    
       from crystallizing.      

298
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,456
 the lab then uses an instrument

299
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,593
   called an atomic absorption  
        spectrophotometer       

300
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,329
     to analyze the syrup's     
        mineral content,        

301
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,599
      making sure it meets      
        market standards.       

302
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:10,007
    next, they warm the syrup   
  in stainless-steel heaters... 

303
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,484
      ...and run it through     
    industrial-sized filters.   

304
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:24,722
   this step ensures the syrup  
    will be perfectly clear.    

305
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,560
   then, just before bottling,  
   they heat the syrup again,   

306
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,497
    this time to 180 degrees.   

307
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,900
    this not only sterilizes    
           the bottles          

308
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:40,605
 but also guarantees the syrup  
 will have a 4-year shelf life. 

309
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,181
  maple syrup is high in sugar  

310
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,784
 but has somewhat fewer calories
   than honey or brown sugar.   

311
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,654
   it's 100% pure and natural,  

312
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,723
     and it's a good source     
 of three essential nutrients --

313
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:04,861
       calcium, potassium,      
         and magnesium.
