    discovery communications    

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,053
            narrator:           
  these gemstones aren't mined. 

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,056
   they're made from garbage.   

5
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:04,796
using plasma technology, organic
waste can be turned into energy,

6
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,533
 and inorganic waste can be made
    into a hard black glass.    

7
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,604
  artisans then turn the glass  
     into beautiful jewelry.    

8
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,475
      black jewels glitter      
     like genuine gemstones     

9
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,877
   and are as hard as quartz.   

10
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,147
    but they aren't precious    
      or even semiprecious.     

11
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,215
      they're pure garbage.     

12
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,117
   they're called plasma gems   

13
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,556
because of the plasma technology
  that creates them from waste. 

14
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:34,093
  this patented system converts 
    almost any type of waste    

15
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,094
        into clean energy       

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,097
        without creating        
     any harmful byproducts.    

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,367
      the process produces      
     two useful materials --    

18
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,903
  energy and a hard black glass 

19
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:49,508
      that artisans can cut     
         into gemstones.        

20
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,110
       the process begins       
       by shredding waste       

21
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,314
       and placing it into      
  the system's plasma reactor.  

22
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,781
       inside the reactor,      

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,653
     two electrodes generate    
 an electrically-conductive gas.

24
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,855
    these plasma arcs create    

25
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,392
          temperatures          
    exceeding 2,900 degrees,    

26
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,994
           converting           
     the carbon-based matter    

27
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,798
   into a gas that can be used  
   to produce electric power.   

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,133
        at the same time,       

29
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,336
      the plasma arcs melt      
  the non-carbon-based matter,  

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,872
      such as glass, metal,     
          and ceramics.         

31
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,142
      the gas fuels engines     
  that produce electric power.  

32
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,479
once melted, the waste separates
        into two layers.        

33
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,683
 metal oxides float to the top, 
 and metals sink to the bottom. 

34
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,486
  the company casts the metals  
          into ingots,          

35
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,554
            which go            
    to a recycling facility.    

36
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,423
   the metal oxides seen here   

37
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,960
    solidify into glass rocks   
       as hard as granite.      

38
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,295
        the company sells       
        these glass rocks       

39
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,300
     to artisans who use it     
 to make gemstones for jewelry. 

40
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,905
       first, the artisan       
   grinds a chunk of the rock   

41
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,242
down to a smaller starting shape
        with a flat side.       

42
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:03,048
 then she glues on a brass dowel
       called a dob stick.      

43
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,184
     she activates the glue     
       with a u.v. light.       

44
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,853
           she returns          
      to the grinding wheel     

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,056
   to further reduce the size   
          of the stone          

46
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,425
          and round it          
      as much as possible.      

47
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,930
  then she mounts the dob stick 
     on a fastening machine.    

48
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,666
      she presses the stone     
    against an abrasive disc    

49
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,003
         called a lathe         
   to file down the diameter.   

50
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,741
     the lathe's surface is     
     made of diamond dust.      

51
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,944
     it's the only material     
          strong enough         

52
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,879
to cut through hard black glass.

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,017
 the artisan measures the stone 
  numerous times as she works,  

54
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,887
      ensuring the diameter     
    is consistent all around.   

55
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,090
  once the diameter is perfect, 

56
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,226
    she adjusts the dob stick   
           diagonally           

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,698
 and begins cutting symmetrical 
 facets that will reflect light.

58
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,839
   you cannot set this machine  
        to cut and polish       

59
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,774
       at an exact angle,       

60
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,310
   so the artisan has to work   
            by feel,            

61
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:09,982
 sensing how hard she must press
   the stone against the disc.  

62
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,517
       she checks her work      
   with a magnification loupe   

63
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,657
   to make sure all the facets  
    meet at a precise point.    

64
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,927
   once she finishes faceting   
    the bottom of the stone,    

65
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,864
      she glues a dob stick     
    to the top of the stone.    

66
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,733
        then she removes        
       the first dob stick      

67
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,037
      by softening the glue     
      with a propane torch.     

68
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,411
     now the artisan begins     
 faceting the top of the stone, 

69
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,680
        called the crown.       

70
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,885
   once the sides are faceted,  
  she flattens the pointed top, 

71
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,888
forming what's called the table.

72
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,157
  she repositions the dob stick 
          horizontally          

73
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:57,562
  to polish a flat edge around  
  the middle called the girdle. 

74
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,265
    she removes the dob stick   

75
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:05,303
 and cleans off any glue residue
          with acetone.         

76
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,307
 she carefully centers the stone
  in a sterling-silver pendant. 

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,445
    the pendant is being held   
  upright in a wad of shellac.  

78
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,380
     she uses a prong pusher    

79
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,849
       to bend the prongs       
    securely over the girdle,   

80
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:22,454
   then rounds off and softens  
     the prongs with a file.    

81
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,656
     to remove the pendant,     

82
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,192
     she softens the shellac    
          over a flame,         

83
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,660
   then submerges the pendant   
           in acetone           

84
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,130
 to remove any shellac residue. 

85
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,900
      on the hardness scale     
        used in gemology,       

86
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:40,305
   plasma gems are equivalent   
  to many varieties of quartz.  

87
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:47,012
 not bad for garbage that would 
   otherwise be in a landfill.  

88
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,691
    narrator: mother nature     
    does not deliver on cue.    

89
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,494
  so when a film or television  
   script calls for flurries,   

90
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,897
     they use a snow machine    
  to generate fake snowflakes.  

91
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,700
     the flakes are actually    
        tiny soap bubbles       

92
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,671
that look surprisingly realistic
           on camera.           

93
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,644
 it's a sweltering day outside, 

94
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,380
   but inside on the film set,  
          it's winter.          

95
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,717
       these soapy flakes       
      look like real snow.      

96
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,852
        they hang around        
        just long enough        

97
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,922
      to show up on screen      
     before they evaporate.     

98
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,724
   to create these snowflakes,  

99
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,126
          workers start         
     with the same chemicals    

100
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,395
          that are used         
      in soap and shampoo.      

101
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,866
a chemist combines the chemicals
       in a big mixing vat      

102
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,134
    and adds purified water.    

103
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,405
          this produces         
   a snow-making concentrate.   

104
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,941
 a machine pumps the concentrate
           into jugs.           

105
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,678
        each jug contains       
      enough base material      

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,783
         to make it snow        
       for up to 16 hours.      

107
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,690
         now work begins        
   on the snow-making machine.  

108
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,494
      a worker drills holes     
 into the back of the snow head 

109
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,162
  using a template as a guide.  

110
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,431
    he threads plastic tubing   
            and wires           

111
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,967
     through the front part     
        of the snow head.       

112
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,769
   the wires are for a blower,  

113
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,772
   and the tubing will be used  
  to deliver the snow solution. 

114
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,576
  he applies silicone caulking  
         around the rim         

115
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,379
      and places the blower     
         in the cavity.         

116
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:34,119
 this blower will introduce air 
 to mix with the snow solution. 

117
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,456
 the caulking acts as a sealant 
 to keep the air from escaping. 

118
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,194
   next, he routes the wiring   
           and tubing           

119
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,797
      through the back part     
        of the snow head.       

120
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,567
          then he joins         
       the two components.      

121
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,774
  he secures the two components 
     with eight long bolts.     

122
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,213
he encases the wiring and tubing
       in a polymer jacket      

123
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,016
          that shrinks          
      when heat is applied.     

124
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,491
  next, a worker carves a hole  

125
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:16,261
        in the center of        
a pre-manufactured blower guard.

126
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,234
    he inserts the snow head    
           in the hole          

127
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,070
    so that the blower guard    
       surrounds the back.      

128
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,441
       he ties the wiring       
    and snow-solution tubing    

129
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,610
          to the guard.         

130
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,582
 next, he maps out screw holes  
 and drills them into a big fan 

131
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,019
  that will blow the fake snow  
             around.            

132
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,056
      he screws in brackets     
        that will be used       

133
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,393
       to hang the machine      
     high above a movie set.    

134
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,000
   he installs a metal guard    
   in the front of the fan...   

135
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,075
  ...and attaches more brackets 
          to the side.          

136
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,579
 these brackets act as a holder 
   for the snow-solution pump.  

137
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:16,087
        now he assembles        
 the snow-head unit to the fan. 

138
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,428
 he ties the snow-solution hose 
     to the snow-head nozzle    

139
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,229
          using wires.          

140
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,966
      he flattens the wires     
          to the nozzle         

141
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:31,436
and covers them with vinyl tape.

142
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,774
  he fits a specially-designed  
  fabric sock over the nozzle.  

143
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,644
   liquid snow will be forced   
  through the pores of the sock 

144
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,447
    to form fake snowflakes.    

145
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,916
  he connects the snow-solution 
       tubing to the pump       

146
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,854
      and pulls the wiring      
   through the top of the fan.  

147
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,857
        next, a metal box       
  that contains the controller  

148
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,994
       for the electronics      
       must be installed.       

149
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,729
he runs the snow-solution tubing
           through it           

150
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,300
   and makes all the necessary  
       wiring connections.      

151
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,272
  the controller box is lowered 
      onto the fan assembly     

152
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,241
      and screwed in place.     

153
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,152
 he installs a weight on the end
  of the snow-solution tubing.  

154
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,955
      the weight will keep      
      the tubing submerged      

155
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,158
 in the snow-solution container.

156
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,298
      this snow machine is      
      now fully assembled.      

157
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,434
 it's over to the test station. 

158
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,037
       here, a technician       
       runs it for hours.       

159
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,374
  he checks that it generates a 
 sufficient number of snowflakes

160
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,778
       and that the flakes      
  are the right size and shape. 

161
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,181
       with his approval,       
    these machines are ready    

162
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:54,319
     to whip up a snowstorm     
when the director says "action."

163
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,396
            narrator:           
a piano is a complex instrument.

164
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,399
   the inner workings operate   
      with exact precision.     

165
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,869
 regular maintenance is required
    to ensure its longevity.    

166
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,807
   but even with proper care,   
 a piano deteriorates with age. 

167
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,877
  this is where a talented team 
     of specialists come in     

168
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,280
       to restore a piano       
      to its former glory.      

169
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,816
         [ piano plays ]        

170
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,223
    a piano that's untunable,   
       has sticking keys,       

171
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:36,528
    or malfunctioning pedals    
 is a pianist's worst nightmare.

172
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,299
 these problems are quite common
        in older pianos,        

173
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,104
        and the only cure       
 is through a major restoration.

174
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,908
      after decades of use,     

175
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,777
         wood, leather,         
    and wool felt components    

176
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,913
     naturally deteriorate.     

177
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:58,516
  metal pins develop cavities,  
          screws rust,          

178
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,653
          dust and dirt         
      inhibit moving parts.     

179
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,921
          an old piano          
      may require anything      

180
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,126
      from minor touch-ups      
     to a complete rebuild.     

181
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:12,596
     it takes up to two days    
  just to take apart the piano. 

182
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,600
         this component,        
       called the action,       

183
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,269
 is the heart of the instrument.

184
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,474
   it has thousands of parts,   
     including 88 piano keys    

185
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:26,610
  and the felt-covered hammers  
       the keys activate.       

186
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,080
        behind the action       
      is the damper action.     

187
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,751
  the dampers stop the strings  
         from vibrating,        

188
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,353
     ending the piano note.     

189
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:39,124
       the restorers begin      
      removing the dampers.     

190
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:49,234
every component must be laid out
    in an organized fashion.    

191
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,836
   this is so they know how to  
   reassemble the instrument.   

192
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,110
they separate the keyboard frame
        from the action.        

193
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,779
     the self-contained part    
          that remains          

194
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,982
   is called the action stack.  

195
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,190
   like the dampers, the other  
wooden parts of the action stack

196
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,460
      deteriorate with age.     

197
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,598
   the felts are usually worn,  
 and everything's caked in dust.

198
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,736
          the restorers         
    replace these components    

199
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,338
   with custom-made replicas.   

200
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,608
  after cleaning and polishing  
  the ornate brass structure,   

201
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,878
     they begin reassembling    
        the action stack.       

202
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,883
   next, the restorers remove   
   and discard any worn parts   

203
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,886
        on the keyboard.        

204
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,888
 they clean the wood thoroughly 

205
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,690
  and install replacement parts 
           as needed.           

206
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,894
     the black keys are made    
         of ebony wood.         

207
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,297
     they can be refinished     
       to look brand-new.       

208
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,900
  older white keys are covered  
           with ivory,          

209
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,503
    which is no longer used.    

210
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,572
    so instead, they install    
    new synthetic coverings     

211
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:06,044
     made of white acrylic      
     or a similar material.     

212
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,713
      the steel and copper      
   piano strings have rusted,   

213
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,316
           tarnished,           
     and fatigued with age.     

214
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,718
  the tuning pins can no longer 
      maintain the tension      

215
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,953
         on the strings.        

216
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,058
    this can change the sound   
       of the instrument,       

217
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,461
     so both the strings and    
  tuning pins must be replaced. 

218
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,130
   the piano will also receive  
        a new pin block.        

219
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,733
          the pin block         
  is a laminated piece of wood  

220
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,534
  that holds the pins in place. 

221
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,336
    to access the pin block,    

222
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,539
       they have to remove      
    a heavy cast-iron plate.    

223
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,344
 the plate holds the strings at 
 a tremendous amount of tension.

224
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,352
once they've removed the plate, 
they can take out the pin block.

225
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,021
          they restore          
   the ornate cast-iron plate   

226
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,424
    by stripping off the old    
  paint finish with chemicals.  

227
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,493
    then they prime, repaint,   

228
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,496
   and apply a protective coat  
       of clear polyester.      

229
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,700
back in the reconstruction area,

230
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,903
       a restorer removes       
  the piano's wooden soundboard 

231
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,905
   and its support structure.   

232
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,909
  they use these original parts 
 as a template for the new ones.

233
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,511
          if the action         
   is the heart of the piano,   

234
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,981
then the soundboard is its soul.

235
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:20,118
    when the strings vibrate    
    against the soundboard,     

236
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,519
    it resonates with sound.    

237
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,255
      on every soundboard,      

238
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,993
 the strings pass over a wooden 
    bridge staggered by pins.   

239
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,662
   the height and positioning   
     of the bridge and pins     

240
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,999
          are critical          
    for producing fine tone.    

241
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,135
    after removing the pins,    
the restorers use the old bridge

242
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,671
       to make a template       
         for a new one.         

243
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,009
        now they install        
 all of the replacement parts --

244
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:49,747
soundboard, bridge, bridge pins,
   pin block, and tuning pins.  

245
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,882
          they install          

246
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,217
      the newly-refurbished     
         cast-iron plate        

247
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,921
    and are ready to perform    
   some cosmetic restoration.

00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,437
            narrator:           
a piano's wooden cabinet or case
  is constructed from hardwood. 

249
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,840
        to give the piano       
   the look of fine furniture,  

250
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,109
     the surface is covered     
 in a thin layer of fancier wood

251
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,179
   such as mahogany, rosewood,  
           or walnut.           

252
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,417
  this veneer usually requires  
  restoration in older pianos.  

253
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,724
     over time, paint peels     
      and varnish darkens.      

254
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,593
    there's often fading from   
   exposure to direct sunlight  

255
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,663
           or cracking          
     due to dry indoor air.     

256
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,866
     to restore the veneer,     
           they begin           

257
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,737
  by using a chemical stripper  
    to remove the old finish.   

258
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,609
      once they've stripped     
    the piano-case parts down   

259
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,077
       to the bare veneer,      

260
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,347
         they sand away         
       any imperfections.       

261
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,616
  then they apply aniline dye.  

262
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,086
    it's a type of stain that   
 penetrates deep into the veneer

263
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,622
     and enhances the grain     
          of the wood.          

264
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,291
 several coats of clear lacquer 
           are applied          

265
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,160
      over the aniline dye.     

266
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,163
this piano was originally black,

267
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:16,633
      so they sand, stain,      
   then paint the wood black.   

268
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,036
    they apply several coats    
            of paint,           

269
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,772
 letting each one dry overnight 

270
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:24,108
   before sanding the surface   
   and applying the next coat.  

271
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,780
 after the final coat, they let 
 the paint cure for two weeks,  

272
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,316
     then do a fine sanding.    

273
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,120
   to make the painted surface  
             glossy,            

274
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,789
  they use a high-speed buffer  
          and a series          

275
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,526
     of progressively-finer     
      polishing compounds.      

276
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,328
 this is a slow and painstaking 
            process.            

277
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,864
   it takes two or three days   
        to complete work        

278
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,834
    on a concert grand piano    
           like this.           

279
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,804
     with the 20-plus parts     
   of the case now refinished,  

280
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:58,076
   the restorers are now ready  
    to reassemble the piano.    

281
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,214
they start by hooking the looped
     end of each new string     

282
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,149
        onto a hitch pin.       

283
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,884
    then they run the string    
         over the bridge        

284
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,887
       to the opposite end      
     of the cast-iron plate,    

285
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,657
 winding it around a tuning pin.

286
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,428
   restorers must wear gloves   
       while restringing.       

287
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,101
natural oils and perspiration on
the hands can tarnish the wires.

288
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,843
       next, they install       
    the refurbished dampers.    

289
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,780
        the original wood       
 has been sanded and refinished.

290
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,418
    they also have new felts    
         and new wires.         

291
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:46,324
       the dampers go into      
   a brand-new damper action.   

292
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,528
    the restorers make minute   
   adjustments and alignments,  

293
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,733
  a meticulous process that can 
  take a few days to complete.  

294
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,669
 but that's nothing compared to 

295
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,872
      regulating the larger     
    and more complex action,    

296
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,642
  which can take several weeks. 

297
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,614
   they make more than a dozen  
      precision adjustments     

298
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,049
    to each of the 88 notes.    

299
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,224
after they reinstall the action,

300
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,161
    they bookend the keyboard   
    with wooden cheekblocks.    

301
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,498
    these are the originals,    
 stripped, sanded, and stained. 

302
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,701
         the cheekblocks        
     help align the keyboard    

303
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:35,139
   so that the hammers strike   
       in the right place.      

304
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,445
 the restorer checks the action 
          one last time         

305
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,848
            to ensure           
   it's performing perfectly.   

306
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,983
         then he's ready        
       to tune the piano.       

307
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,453
 he weaves a strip of wool cloth
       through the strings      

308
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:52,723
 to mute all but the one string 
         they're tuning.

         [ notes play ]         

311
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,201
once he's tuned all the strings,

312
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,338
 the inner workings of the piano
       are as good as new.

314

        restorers finish        
   reassembling the piano case  

315
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,748
  and give it a final dusting.  

316
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,619
      except for the legs,      
   all of the piano-case parts  

317
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:26,757
 have a solid wood core covered 
   in a newly-restored veneer.  

318
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,831
           this veneer          
   isn't just for aesthetics.   

319
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,034
    it prevents the wood core   
 from expanding and contracting 

320
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,637

322
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,583
     restoring an old piano     
  is part technical challenge,  

323
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,385
       part labor of love.      

324
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,387
 after many weeks of hard work, 

325
00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:00,691
this instrument looks and sounds
  just as it did in its heyday.
