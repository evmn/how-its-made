00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,892
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,661
           laminate...          

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,533
       ...frozen treats...      

6
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,306
...children's building blocks...

7
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,277
       ...and detergents.       

8
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,454
      narrator: laminate is     
a thin, decorative surface layer

9
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,256
      that's usually glued      
    onto a particleboard base   

10
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,392
     to create a countertop.    

11
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,129
  laminate is, by far, the most 
 affordable countertop material 

12
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,530
         on the market.         

13
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,667
  it comes in an endless choice 
     of colors and patterns,    

14
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,737
           from solids          
  to simulated wood or granite. 

15
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,743
     they also use laminate     
for kitchen cabinets, furniture,

16
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,812
    and laboratory surfaces.    

17
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,416
      and they manufacture      
  fast-food restaurant seating, 

18
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,486
       among other things,      
  out of a thicker, solid form  

19
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:31,022
         of the material        
    called compact laminate.    

20
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,757
  the back of a laminate sheet  

21
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,560
is made of a type of kraft paper

22
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:38,430
  that can be saturated without 
   becoming soggy and tearing.  

23
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,567
      a treater drenches it     
  with resin containing phenol, 

24
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,569
a compound derived from benzene.

25
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,572
            the resin           
  doesn't just coat the paper.  

26
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,640
    it absorbs right through.   

27
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,710
            the paper           
   then enters a drying oven.   

28
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,913
   the hot air cures the resin  
     in a matter of seconds.    

29
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,984
   now they can wind the paper  
          into a roll.          

30
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,253
     the top of the laminate    
 is called the decorative layer.

31
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,522
      it's a sheet of paper     

32
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,191
   in either a printed design   
        or a solid color.       

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,794
       solid-color papers       
      go through a treater      

34
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,631
   that impregnates them with   
the more durable melamine resin.

35
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,600
     durability is essential    

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,471
  because the decorative layer  
  must withstand wear and tear. 

37
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,474
         two big rollers        
   ring out the excess resin.   

38
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,077
    then the saturated paper    
   goes through a drying oven.  

39
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,747
    with the resin now cured,   

40
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,550
    a cutter slices the paper   
          into sheets.          

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,488
     before resin treatment,    

42
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,325
            the paper           
 was flexible and easy to tear. 

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,231
   now it's stiff and brittle.  

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,168
      bend it, and it snaps     
       like a potato chip.      

45
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,975
  while the rolls of saturated  
kraft paper get cut into sheets,

46
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,245
 workers prepare the other style
     of decorative layers --    

47
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:01,647
   those with printed design,   

48
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,982
  such as simulated wood grains 
          and granite.          

49
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,586
      the treatment process     
        for these papers        

50
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:11,323
  is quite different than that  
   for the solid-color papers.  

51
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,062
          workers start         
   by cutting them into sheets  

52
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,665
         the same length        
   as the kraft-paper sheets.   

53
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,401
          these papers          
     don't go into a treater    

54
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,137
   to be saturated with resin.  

55
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,808
   instead workers stack them,  
 placing an overlay on each one.

56
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,544
          an overlay is         
  a transparent sheet of paper  

57
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,347
        that's saturated        
       with melanin resin.      

58
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,284
  workers stack the solid-color 
    sheets in the same pile,    

59
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,952
  but those don't need overlays 

60
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,423
  because they've already been  
        resin-saturated.        

61
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:47,526
          now the stack         
     goes to the press room.    

62
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,630
         there, workers         
    put saturated kraft paper   

63
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,733
  under each decorative layer.  

64
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,241
on top of each decorative layer,
   they lay a textured plate.   

65
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:06,545
 this will prevent the finished 
laminate from sticking together.

66
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,992
           everything           
     now goes into a press.     

67
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,528
  the intense heat and pressure 
      compress the layers.      

68
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,930
          the overlays          
   bond to the printed papers,  

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,468
  and the saturated kraft paper 
 bonds to each decorative layer,

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,703
    creating laminate sheets.   

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,674
       the textured plates      
        between each set        

72
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,344
      imprint their pattern     
  onto the heat-softened resin, 

73
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,446
 texturing the laminate surface.

74
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,720
     the laminates come out     
    of the press fully cured.   

75
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,232
     on the finishing line,     

76
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,303
        machines trim off       
  any excess paper on the edges 

77
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,239
and sand the back of the sheets.

78
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,107
     this helps the laminate    
          adhere better         

79
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,510
   when glued to particleboard  
  or another type of substrate. 

80
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,913
  to produce compact laminates, 

81
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,850
  workers compile a thick stack 
 of black saturated kraft papers

82
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,820
         and sandwich it        
 between two decorative layers. 

83
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:27,659
  the press melts and bonds all 
  the sheets into a solid unit. 

84
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,596
       alternating colors       
     produce a striped edge.    

85
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,865
 compact laminates are so thick,

86
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,000
        they're entirely        
        self-supporting.        

87
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,869
     unlike laminate sheets,    

88
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,806
         they don't need        
  to be applied to a substrate. 

89
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,881
            narrator:           
   on a sweltering summer day,  

90
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,484
         a frozen treat         
       sure hits the spot.      

91
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,821
 eating a fruit bar, fudge bar, 
    or ice-cream bar, though,   

92
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,889
  requires a certain strategy.  

93
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,092
   you have to hold the treat   
          by the stick,         

94
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,961
      lean slightly forward     
       to dodge the drips,      

95
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,832
   then lick like crazy before  
it melts and lands at your feet.

96
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,171
         the outer shell        
       of these cream pops      

97
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,040
 starts with a transparent base 

98
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,311
  made of water, liquid sugar,  
    corn syrup, citric acid,    

99
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,112
        and a stabilizer.       

100
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,782
          it travels to         
three separate compartment vats,

101
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,051
     each of which mixes in     
      a different coloring      

102
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,385
         and flavoring.         

103
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:31,523
      this company produces     
 three flavors of cream pops -- 

104
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,327
       strawberry, orange,      
       and blue raspberry.      

105
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,529
      each compartment vat      
        pumps its flavor        

106
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,198
          to a machine          
   called the filling hopper.   

107
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,802
  the hopper injects the liquid 
        into row upon row       

108
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,606
 of half-ounce pop-shaped molds.

109
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,877
    this production line has    
 340 molds in continuous motion.

110
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,551
        the molds descend       
      into a tank of brine,     

111
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,354
    water chilled to negative   
      30 degrees fahrenheit     

112
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,088
       mixed with calcium.      

113
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,425
 calcium works like antifreeze, 

114
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,363
keeping the water liquid despite
 the below-freezing temperature.

115
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,633
       as the molds travel      
   through the ice-cold brine,  

116
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,636
       the liquid freezes       
    from the outside inward,    

117
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:19,771
        creating a shell        

118
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,474
        that will encase        
  the pops' ice-cream filling.  

119
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,245
         once the shell         
    is 1/10 of an inch thick,   

120
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,380
            a machine           
   called a suction evacuator   

121
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,249
   removes the unfrozen liquid  

122
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,251
        and feeds it back       
     to the filling hopper,     

123
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,288
        to be re-injected       
    at the start of the line.   

124
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,300
    the shells are empty now    
     and ready for filling.     

125
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,808
  the ice-cream filling is made 
    of various milk products    

126
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,679
 blended with liquid cane sugar,
    corn syrup, stabilizers,    

127
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,816
         and emulsifiers        
   to puff up the consistency.  

128
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,152
           the factory          
    pasteurizes the mixture,    

129
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,356
    heating it for 35 seconds   
   at 180 degrees fahrenheit,   

130
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,757
        then freezing it.       

131
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,759
   it homogenizes the filling,  

132
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,662
    skimming off the milk fat   
   that rises to the surface.   

133
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,567
           the shells           
   are still floating in brine  

134
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,970
          as they reach         
      the filling station.      

135
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,972
       the machine shoots       
        in the ice cream,       

136
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,373
   overfilling the shell a bit  

137
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,942
         to create a cap        
      4/10 of an inch wide.     

138
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,985
      the ice cream begins      
  to harden in the cold brine.  

139
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,521
         once it reaches        
      a semi-frozen state,      

140
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,190
     a machine appropriately    
    called the stick inserter   

141
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,627
       pops a wooden stick      
          in each mold.         

142
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,804
  now the molds leave the brine 

143
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,841
    and enter a tank of warm    
 water -- 75 degrees fahrenheit,

144
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,878
      hot enough to detach      
  the cream pops from the mold  

145
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,081
      without melting them      
         in the process.        

146
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,950
     from initial injection     
      to final extraction,      

147
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,819
    it's been seven minutes.    

148
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,159
        the machine dips        
  the cream pops in cold water  

149
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,895
           to produce           
  a protective coating of ice.  

150
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,964
   this will keep the surface   
  from sticking to the wrapper. 

151
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,834
      it will also lengthen     
    the product's shelf life.   

152
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,373
           the machine          
     deposits the cream pops    

153
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,643
    into a continuous stream    
       of paper wrapping.       

154
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:42,580
    heating elements seal the   
wrapper on top and between pops,

155
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,783
 then a slicer cuts them apart. 

156
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,120
  the empty molds go through an 
 automatic wash-and-rinse cycle 

157
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:53,257
        on their way back       
    to the start of the line.   

158
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,895
   these molds are for making   
      chocolate-fudge bars.     

159
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,934
     the production process     
          is the same,          

160
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,070
      except that the shell     
       is fudge-flavored,       

161
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,805
      made from milk solids     
      and chocolate powder.     

162
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,874
           and instead          
   of ice cream in the center,  

163
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,444
 there's chewy chocolate syrup. 

164
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,354
the factory stamps the packaging
    for all its frozen treats   

165
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,557
    with the production date    
     and other information.     

166
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,694
       these frozen treats      
   have a one-year shelf life   

167
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,829
         in the freezer,        

168
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,831
      provided you maintain     
         the temperature        

169
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,735
           at an ideal          
 negative 13 degrees fahrenheit.

170
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,110
            narrator:           
    few toys are as timeless    

171
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,378
as interlocking building blocks.

172
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,514
     children can stick them    
   together, pull them apart,   

173
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,850
  and rearrange them endlessly. 

174
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,120
     from large-sized blocks    
           for babies           

175
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,255
        to intricate kits       
         for older kids,        

176
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,590
         building blocks        
      stimulate creativity      

177
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,860
  and improve manual dexterity. 

178
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,734
       this company makes       
    plastic building blocks.    

179
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,669
 depending on the type of block,

180
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,740
  it uses either polypropylene, 
   high-density polyethylene,   

181
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,743
   or high-impact polystyrene.  

182
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:23,348
      these plastics arrive     
   at the factory in pellets.   

183
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,483
         because they're        
     naturally transparent,     

184
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,552
the first step is to color them.

185
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,488
   the pellets go into a mixer  

186
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,224
    along with pigment beads    
    made of powdered pigment    

187
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,828
  and a type of plastic that's  
  compatible with the pellets.  

188
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,233
    the pigment beads make up   
     just 2% of the weight,     

189
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,203
   but that's enough to color   
     the plastic a deep hue.    

190
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,308
         the mixer feeds        
  a plastic injection machine.  

191
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,444
      it heats the pellets      
   to 400 degrees fahrenheit,   

192
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,514
          melting them          
     in a matter of seconds.    

193
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,118
    the machine then injects    
 the molten plastic into molds. 

194
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,922
     a system of hoses cools    
   the molds with cold water,   

195
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,325
instantly hardening the plastic.

196
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,726
     when the machine opens,    

197
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,397
   ejectors thrust the blocks   
    to a conveyor belt below.   

198
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,867
  for these blocks, the entire  
  cycle, from start to finish,  

199
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,936
     takes just 14 seconds.     

200
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,540
 the length of the cycle varies 
   with the size of the block.  

201
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,877
   this large school bus, for   
 example, requires more plastic,

202
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,914
      so injection molding      
        takes 22 seconds.       

203
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,754
     the wheels for the bus     
        take 20 seconds.        

204
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,909
       at packaging time,       

205
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,846
  each type of block is loaded  
 into a separate vibrating bowl.

206
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,248
           the shaking          
      separates the pieces,     

207
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,319
    enabling them to pass by    
 an optical counter one by one. 

208
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,722
         this automated         
       counting equipment       

209
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:14,125
  can tally up to 16 different  
   types of blocks at a time.   

210
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,194
      it can be programmed      
        to assemble a kit       

211
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,665
     consisting of specific     
  quantities of certain blocks. 

212
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,952
    once each kit is counted,   
     it drops into a bucket.    

213
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,760
           the factory          
     also makes the buckets     

214
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:51,296
  by plastic injection molding. 

215
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,297
    and it even incorporates    
          the labeling          

216
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,965
    right into that process.    

217
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,368
    here's how it all works.    

218
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,437
    a robot takes two labels,   

219
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,273
 one for the front of the bucket
      and one for the back.     

220
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,443
  it passes a static generator  

221
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,179
        that charges them       
    with static electricity.    

222
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,252
  then it loads the two labels  
         into the mold.         

223
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,455
   the static cling holds them  
       in a flat position       

224
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,257
        while the machine       
       injects the plastic      

225
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,292
      and molds the bucket.     

226
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,491
         the hot plastic        
  melts the labels on contact,  

227
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,895
          bonding them          
    into the finished bucket.   

228
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,432
      the result -- labels      
    that can't be peeled off.   

229
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,108
   the factory produces large   
    blocks from polypropylene   

230
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:15,313
  or high-density polyethylene, 
  which are flexible plastics.  

231
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,116
  this makes the blocks easier  
   for young children to use.   

232
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,654
      small blocks are made     
   of high-impact polystyrene,  

233
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,390
  a plastic that can be molded  
      with great precision      

234
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,893
    into tight-fitting blocks   
  designed for older children.  

235
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,273
  narrator: just walk down the  
aisle of your local supermarket,

236
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,477
    and you'll see shelf upon   
shelves of soaps and detergents.

237
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:50,014
      with so many versions     
 of each product to choose from,

238
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,216
       from extra-strength      
        to antibacterial        

239
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,617
      to lemon-fresh scent,     

240
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,921
        consumers aren't        
   the only ones cleaning up.   

241
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:09,367
  the craft of soapmaking began 
   in europe around 700 a.d.,   

242
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,970
 but soap remained a luxury item
   for another thousand years.  

243
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,705
 that's when a french scientist 

244
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,241
           discovered           
   how to make inexpensive lye  

245
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,243
        using table salt.       

246
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,579
 people also made soap at home, 

247
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,314
      by boiling wood ashes     
        with animal fats.       

248
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,518
          by the 1900s,         
    the growing soap industry   

249
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,455
     found ways to make mild    
    and fragranced products.    

250
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,457
 and in 1916, a german scientist

251
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,427
       invented the first       
      synthetic detergent.      

252
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,740
  this company produces mostly  
   industrial-use detergents,   

253
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,142
      liquid and powdered.      

254
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:54,011
     it uses salt as filler     
      in the powdered ones.     

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,816
   fillers add volume, making   
  a product less concentrated.  

256
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,418
          this will be          
      a powdered detergent      

257
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,021
          for cleaning          
  and degreasing cement floors. 

258
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,290
       they add colorant,       
        then surfactant,        

259
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,426
 a substance that creates foam, 

260
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,628
           the vehicle          
     for lifting away dirt.     

261
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,297
   now they pour in pine oil,   

262
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,235
      a disinfecting agent      
    that also adds fragrance.   

263
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:21,238
    now the cleaning agent --   
    sodium tripolyphosphate.    

264
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:25,175
      it's essential to mix     
 all the ingredients thoroughly.

265
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,643
   this ensures the chemicals   

266
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,113
     are evenly distributed     
     throughout the cleaner.    

267
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,384
       the last ingredient      

268
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,187
      is a chemical called      
      sodium metasilicate.      

269
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,656
            it boosts           
  the mixture's alkaline level. 

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,392
     this particular cleaner    
      needs high alkalinity     

271
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,994
        to be effective.        

272
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,264
      the factory packages      
     its powdered cleaners,     

273
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,333
   such as this laundry soap,   
    in large plastic buckets.   

274
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,871
automated equipment weighs, then
pours in the appropriate amount,

275
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,741
      capping the container     
    tightly to prevent leaks.   

276
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,412
      the filler in liquid      
   cleaning products is water.  

277
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:05,816
  to produce liquid hand soap,  
   they first add citric acid.  

278
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,885
  this creates the mild acidity 

279
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,556
     needed to get the most     
     out of the surfactants.    

280
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:16,093
    this soap contains three    
 different types of surfactants.

281
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,697
   it's a specific formulation  
 designed by the company chemist

282
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,500
     to optimize the soap's     
         cleaning power.        

283
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,972
to give the soap a pearl luster,

284
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,310
        the company uses        
this secret recipe of chemicals.

285
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,915
        the factory makes       
     most of its liquid soap    

286
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,917
  from this same base mixture.  

287
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,653
 the colors and fragrances vary.

288
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,656
          for coloring,         
   it uses powdered pigments.   

289
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,993
 it dissolves them in hot water,
       then pours them in.      

290
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,930
this batch of soap will be pink.

291
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,902
            they pour           
 in a rose-scented fragrance... 

292
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,341
   ...then add a preservative   
  to prevent the proliferation  

293
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,943
           of bacteria          
   should the soap be exposed   

294
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,678
  to a substandard environment. 

295
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,283
            finally,            
    they adjust the viscosity   

296
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,685
 by adding a powdered thickener.

297
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,088
    if liquid soap is runny,    
it'll leak out of the dispenser.

298
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:22,693
   after 15 minutes of mixing,  
       the soap is ready.       

299
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,629
 and the lab analyzes a sample, 

300
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:29,566
     assessing its physical     
    and chemical properties.    

301
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,302
 when the batch gets the "okay,"

302
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,971
           it proceeds          
    to the packaging machine.   

303
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,240
       this soap is going       
       into dispenser bags      

304
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,775
      made of plastic film.     

305
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,444
           the machine          
     first inserts a valve.     

306
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,654
 it heat-seals the film, forming
     the bottom of the bag.     

307
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,058
         then it injects        
       27 ounces of soap.       

308
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,995
     next, it simultaneously    
  heat-seals the top of the bag 

309
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,597
 and the bottom of the next one.

310
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,998
       it cuts them apart,      

311
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,669
   releasing the finished bag   
    to a conveyor belt below.   

312
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
    after checking for leaks,   

313
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,544
   workers insert a spout that  
 controls output from the valve.

314
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,479
   this ensures the dispenser   

315
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,616
 will release a measured amount 
        of soap per push.       

316
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,221
    elsewhere in the factory,   
      an automated machine      

317
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,156
   called the pressure filler   
    pumps dishwashing liquid    

318
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,292
      into plastic bottles.     

319
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,361
           an overflow          
    and weight-control device   

320
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,630
  ensures the right fill level. 

321
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,377
    the next machine applies    
a twist cap with pull-out spout.

322
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,549
   then it's off to labeling.   

323
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:59,323
 those bags of liquid hand soap 
     went into special boxes    

324
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,827
 that are designed to slip right
    into the soap dispenser.    

325
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,809
