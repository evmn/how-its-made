narrator: today, on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,186
in the music industry,      

5
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,422
winning a grammy is the ultimate accolade.    

6
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,592
the national academy      
of recording arts and sciences  

7
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:04,130
has been awarding grammys for recording since 1958.    

8
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,933
every year, the winners     

9
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,803
are honored with a golden gramophone trophy.             

10
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,675
the grammys are to the music industry      

11
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:18,277
what the oscars are to movies.  

12
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,014
the coveted trophy is made of gold-plated grammium.            

13
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,751
but don't look for that metal on the periodic table.      

14
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,287
it's a proprietary zinc alloy specially formulated       

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:34,159
and trademarked by the artisan who makes the grammys.      

16
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,828
to make the base of the trophy,             

17
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,165
they heat the grammium to 644 degrees          

18
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,534
and pour it into a bronze mold.              

19
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,308
they immediately pour out the excess molten metal.     

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,244
what remains quickly solidifies in a thin layer         

21
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,112
against the walls of the cavity,             

22
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,248
creating a hollow cast.     

23
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,788
they also cast the gramophone's cabinet     

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,391
and tone arm in grammium.    

25
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,728
they remove mold seams, excess metal,          

26
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,197
and smooth out the surface of each cast component      

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,798
with a belt sander.       

28
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:22,575
then, they file by hand the areas the belt can't reach.             

29
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,484
finally, they polish the metal  

30
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:35,087
with an abrasive compound on a buffing wheel.       

31
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,424
they make sure there are no surface imperfections.    

32
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,764
now, they work on the gramophone's iconic horn.              

33
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,232
using a metal shear,       

34
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,636
they cut a disc of malleable bronze.       

35
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:53,572
they mount the disc on a lathe.             

36
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,975
as the lathe spins, they use a series of tools    

37
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,079
to transform the flat disc into a horn.           

38
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,186
then, they spin the horn on a different lathe,      

39
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,921
pressing an abrasive cloth against the surface       

40
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,525
to remove any tool marks.    

41
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,994
before they connect the tone arm to the cabinet,         

42
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,196
they brush on some flux,     

43
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,799
a chemical that makes the stationary solder flow    

44
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:24,670
into the tiny gap between components.       

45
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:29,375
now, they bolt the tone arm to the cabinet, then solder.   

46
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,815
they submerge this part of the trophy          

47
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,685
in a degreasing solution for a few minutes,        

48
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,589
then in water.          

49
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:50,963
gold doesn't adhere to zinc, so they plate it with copper.  

50
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,366
they run a positive electric charge through the trophy    

51
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,702
and a negative charge through a piece of copper    

52
00:03:56,704 --> 00:04:00,039
also suspended in the plating tank.       

53
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,774
this process dissolves the copper,      

54
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,910
then draws the particles through the water        

55
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,379
and onto the trophy.       

56
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,515
they repeat the electroplating process in a different tank,   

57
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,185
this time with nickel.      

58
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,720
nickel creates a sufficiently hard base     

59
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,590
to support the gold plating.   

60
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,861
it also makes gold appear brighter.         

61
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,464
after another rinse, it's back into a tank      

62
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:30,736
for the final plating with 24-karat gold.       

63
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,272
to prepare the trophy's base for painting,          

64
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,208
they smooth the surface with a belt sander,       

65
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,614
then fine-sand by hand.     

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,418
they spray on an epoxy primer,  

67
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,356
let it dry for a day then wet sand it with fine sandpaper.           

68
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,160
they repeat these steps with a black primer,       

69
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,562
then paint the base with high-gloss,         

70
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:59,431
chip-resistant black paint.   

71
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:04,302
once it dries, they can finish assembling the trophy.      

72
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,106
they bolt the polished gold-plated cabinet and tone arm               

73
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,908
to the painted base.       

74
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,778
then, they take the horn,    

75
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,115
which has been gold-plated and polished,          

76
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,517
and screw it into the tone arm.              

77
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,256
after 15 hours of craftsmanship,         

78
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:28,460
this grammy is ready to be awarded.     

79
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,731
but this trophy won't be handed out during the award show.    

80
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,733
the grammys handed out on stage              

81
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:38,804
are actually props       
that are used year after year.  

82
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,073
the winners receive a personalized trophy  

83
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,876
a few weeks after the show.   

84
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,944
the base has a brass plate    

85
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,815
engraved with their name and musical category.      

86
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,096
narrator: the first bicycle lights     

87
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,566
were modified kerosene lamps fixed to the handlebars.     

88
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,235
the concept was truly trailblazing      

89
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,904
and made it possible to cycle at night.        

90
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,708
a century later, the technology has changed,   

91
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,310
but the concept remains the same.        

92
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:21,714
bicycle lights are still showing us the way.  

93
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,852
these bicycle lights       

94
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:32,191
are battery-powered with energy-efficient l.e.d. lights.             

95
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:34,125
mounted to handlebars or a helmet,           

96
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,394
they make it possible      

97
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,497
for a cyclist to see and be seen at night.   

98
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:48,206
a bicycle light starts with a design for the canister.            

99
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,212
in this case, it's for a handlebar-mounted trail light.             

100
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,746
following that plan,       

101
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,549
computerized tools carve blocks of aluminum     

102
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:01,153
into a two-part mold for the bicycle light reflector.           

103
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:08,627
they secure the mold in an injection molding machine.            

104
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,629
then, they load white acrylic pellets             

105
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,966
into the machine's hopper.    

106
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,434
the machine grinds        

107
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,637
and melts the acrylic pellets into a thick liquid.       

108
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,374
then, it pushes the liquid   
into the crevices of the mold.  

109
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:27,579
the acrylic quickly solidifies 
into the shape of a reflector.  

110
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:33,118
an aluminum finish makes the acrylic shiny and reflective.  

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,522
then, it's over to a different injection-molding machine.    

112
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,927
this one uses molten rubber to form four on/off buttons.   

113
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,201
a worker sets an l.e.d.-studded circuit board on a switch    

114
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,004
cradled in a fixture.      

115
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:53,472
she trims wires         

116
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:57,009
from the switch that protrudes through the board.        

117
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,278
she solders those wires to copper pads on the board,   

118
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,049
securing the switch and making an electrical connection.    

119
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,887
she removes the assembly from the fixture         

120
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,890
and threads the battery cord through the board.        

121
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,763
she attaches the board to a vented heat sink,      

122
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,100
which will draw heat away from the lights,      

123
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,402
allowing them to run more efficiently.        

124
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,776
she installs the reflector over the tiny l.e.d. lights.   

125
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,245
the reflector will focus the light forward,  

126
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,247
creating narrow beams.      

127
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,052
another member of the team    

128
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,522
places a tray of reflector covers in a laser etcher.    

129
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,263
he closes the lid and activates the laser.     

130
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,600
it etches through tape that's been applied to the metal.    

131
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,869
the tape has a blackening agent on it.              

132
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,271
the laser transfers that blackening agent      

133
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,472
to the etched number,      

134
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,408
making it stand out.       

135
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,544
the number indicates the lumen power of the light.  

136
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,147
lumen is a measure of the total amount of visible light     

137
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,816
emitted by a source.       

138
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,217
back on the assembly line,    

139
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,555
a worker snaps the cover onto the bike light.       

140
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,958
then, she attaches an open guard to the heat sink         

141
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,693
to protect the cyclist      

142
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,696
from the heat generated by the l.e.d.s.         

143
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:28,433
this bicycle light is ready to be put to the test.              

144
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,301
a technician turns it on     

145
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,305
and inserts it in a device called a lumen sphere.      

146
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,040
a computer analyzes the light  

147
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:40,512
and finds that it meets standards.     

148
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,847
next, an employee builds a smaller bike light       

149
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,383
for a cyclist helmet.      

150
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,188
she inserts the l.e.d. assembly in a canister,          

151
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,390
then attaches the on/off button.             

152
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:56,194
she attaches the light to a circuit board        

153
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,230
with three l.e.d.s.       

154
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,867
she tucks the circuit board into the housing         

155
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:07,005
and inserts a rechargeable lithium battery.            

156
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,941
she puts the assembly aside   

157
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,343
and attaches a red reflective panel      

158
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,212
to an aluminized reflector.   

159
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,215
she snaps the assembly into a clear plastic case,    

160
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,551
completing the rear light lens.              

161
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,156
she returns for the front helmet light    

162
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:26,691
and installs the reflector over the light.         

163
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,662
she screws on a glass cover that's framed by a metal bezel.             

164
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
she joins the rear lens     

165
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,303
and the l.e.d. assembly, encasing the electronics     

166
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,072
of this bike light.       

167
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,910
she switches on both lights to confirm            

168
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,112
that they're fully operational.          

169
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,652
these bicycle lights are ready to illuminate a rider's path,  

170
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,054
whether it's a shadowy mountain trail     

171
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,523
or a dark city street.      

172
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,407
narrator:            
installing a pool above ground  

173
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,409
costs much less         
than installing one in ground.  

174
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,746
this is because there's no excavation required.     

175
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,949
you can build an elevated deck around the top          

176
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,885
to give it an in-ground appearance,     

177
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,622
or you can simply climb     
up a ladder and jump right in.  

178
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:38,230
no hole to dig, no underground pipes to install.            

179
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,300
just a day or so of on-site prep and assembly,  

180
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,501
and you can take to your above-ground pool    

181
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,237
like a duck to water.      

182
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,975
at the factory, a computer-guided machine    

183
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:53,979
cuts vinyl panels for the pool's water-retaining inside surface.            

184
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,182
the vinyl comes in a wide choice of printed designs.       

185
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,985
it's tear-resistant, u.v.-resistant,         

186
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:03,455
and is treated with an antifungal coating.   

187
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,590
the wall panel is rectangular,  

188
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:10,395
and the floor panels are curved to fit the pool's perimeter.   

189
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,264
the wall panels go through a welder that fuses a bead    

190
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,268
to the top edge.         

191
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,604
a bead is a flexible, "u'-shaped, thermoplastic strip              

192
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,874
that is used to attach the pool wall to the liner.   

193
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,613
a hot welding tool slightly melts both the bead   

194
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,616
and the liner edge, so when they cool and solidify,            

195
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,218
they're bonded.         

196
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,889
the liner is ready to be assembled.         

197
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,359
workers use a manual welding machine     

198
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:44,496
that generates heat with radio frequencies.     

199
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,898
they overlap the edges of adjoining panels,       

200
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,635
then fuse them together.     

201
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,837
after connecting the floor panels to each other,             

202
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,576
workers complete the liner by  
joining the wall to the floor.  

203
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,846
a quality-control inspector checks every soldered seam    

204
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,615
to make sure they're solid.   

205
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,720
meanwhile, workers manufacture  

206
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,057
the pool's structural components.      

207
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,193
they feed a continuous strip of painted, galvanized steel   

208
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,662
through a roll former.      

209
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,666
the strip is shaped to a specific profile.      

210
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
a punch press cuts the components       

211
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,605
to the required length and shape.            

212
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,076
four different structural components are made this way --               

213
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,546
the pieces that form the top  
and bottom tracks of the pool,  

214
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,549
the vertical posts that support the pool wall,   

215
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:42,286
and the ledges running along the top of the wall.    

216
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:46,157
the wall is also made of painted galvanized steel.   

217
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,561
a roller impresses a corrugated pattern to give the wall     

218
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,763
more vertical strength.     

219
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,698
then, a press punches out openings       

220
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,635
for the pool's water inlet and filter.           

221
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,038
after folding each end of the wall over itself     

222
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,773
to form a strong edge,      

223
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:05,377
they punch holes for the bolts that will join the edges.    

224
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,182
a stamping die progressively shapes strips   

225
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,917
of galvanized steel into connectors.         

226
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,053
the connectors join the vertical posts     

227
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,524
to the structure's bottom track and top rail.          

228
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,193
an injection molder       

229
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:25,797
makes the plastic covers that will hide those connectors.           

230
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,932
workers then box the liner    

231
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,868
and structural components for transport          

232
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,670
to the installation site.    

233
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,143
on-site, they lay crushed stone around the perimeter       

234
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,113
to support the bottom track   
under the weight of the water.  

235
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,622
next, they unroll the pool wall              

236
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,357
and place it in the bottom track.       

237
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,303
they place a vertical post over each bottom connector    

238
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,339
and secure it with screws.    

239
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,908
inside the pool wall,      

240
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,980
they lay down a base of sand and compact it.         

241
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:19,384
then, they lay down landscaping fabric.   

242
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,354
they cut a hole for a central bottom drain.   

243
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,059
then, they begin spreading out the liner.          

244
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,867
they hook the bead       
over the top edge of the wall,  

245
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,071
then lock it in place with the top rail.        

246
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,073
once the liner is fully attached,        

247
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,478
they suction out the air to draw it tight against the wall.    

248
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,348
they seal the liner to the bottom drain.       

249
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,351
they hide the top rail under the ledge         

250
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,121
and the connections under plastic caps.       

251
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:02,828
they run pipes to connect the  
filtration system and skimmer.  

252
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,699
then, with an ordinary garden hose,           

253
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,135
they fill the pool with water.  

254
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,585
narrator: foldable solar panels were invented in the 1990s    

255
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:30,721
for american soldiers in the field.          

256
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,659
they use them to recharge electronic devices.            

257
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,996
the panels have environmental and tactical advantages,     

258
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,399
conserving both electricity and physical energy.       

259
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,006
today, foldable solar panels  
are not just for the military.  

260
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,142
these lightweight panels can be folded up         

261
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,344
and tucked into a backpack,   

262
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,814
allowing anyone to escape to the wilderness   

263
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,816
but stay plugged in.       

264
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,356
production starts with a roll of thin plastic film.      

265
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,960
it's the same material used to make flat-screen tvs.  

266
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,163
a worker loads it into machines that distribute thin layers   

267
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,866
of aluminum and silicon onto it.               

268
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,237
the aluminum acts as an electrical contact.    

269
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:26,511
the silicon produces electricity when exposed to the sun's rays.              

270
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:32,717
next, lasers carve vertical and horizontal lines into the film.              

271
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,754
these lines define the solar cells.     

272
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,127
an automated squeegee applies black ink through a screen    

273
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,263
and into the lines.       

274
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,066
the ink will act as an electrical insulator.   

275
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,333
it also makes it possible    

276
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:53,071
to cut through the film without damaging it.       

277
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,809
uv light cures the insulator ink.        

278
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,279
an employee pours a generous amount of metallic silver ink  

279
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,881
onto a pattern.         

280
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:06,550
a squeegee forces the ink through to the solar film.    

281
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,622
this creates a conductive grid on the film.           

282
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:15,226
a camera magnifies the grid for inspection.         

283
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,362
the solar film travels through a chamber        

284
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,731
where heat cures the silver ink.              

285
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,303
a laser now connects the solar cells,    

286
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,905
linking the bottom aluminum layer of one cell        

287
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:30,909
to the top silicon layer of the next.           

288
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,247
the laser ties them together   

289
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,584
similar to how a soldering tool would.   

290
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,920
this establishes electrical connections      

291
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:46,724
and increases the voltage significantly.          

292
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,860
a different camera magnifies the connections    

293
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,863
to check the alignment.     

294
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:55,466
now, a worker loads       
the solar film into a machine.  

295
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,536
it deposits a transparent oxide onto the film          

296
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,806
that will increase conductivity.          

297
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,676
these solar cells are now fully functional.    

298
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,546
the next machine tests each one.              

299
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:14,018
it also applies a conductive foil tape at certain points.   

300
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,821
another machine         
rolls a clear sheet of plastic  

301
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,891
onto the solar cells.      

302
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,093
the plastic adheres to the cells,          

303
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:26,164
waterproofing and encapsulating them.     

304
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,099
a die press cuts out solar panels         

305
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:31,302
along the black insulator lines.             

306
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:35,440
the press uses computerized cameras for accurate cuts.    

307
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,778
a robot transfers each panel to the next station       

308
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,913
using suctioning heads.     

309
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,315
a computerized camera      

310
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,185
scrutinizes the panels for defects.           

311
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,324
after more testing,       

312
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:57,995
they deposit the panels on a piece of fabric.      

313
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,266
a laser cuts the fabric around the panels.        

314
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,837
heated rollers bond the plastic panels to the fabric.      

315
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,144
now, an employee burns through clear plastic film              

316
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,814
to reach the conductive foil.  

317
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,481
he solders wire to the foil   

318
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,152
at these points to connect the positive and negative leads.             

319
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,957
the wire is flexible and will bend with the fabric  

320
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,693
when it's folded.        

321
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,764
a seamstress now stitches strips of fabric    

322
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:37,602
over the wires, enclosing them in a protective pocket.     

323
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,875
another member of the team solders a connector       

324
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:50,515
to a circuit board that's been attached to protruding wires.  

325
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,251
he squeezes silicone into a plastic cover       

326
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,653
and places it on the assembly.  

327
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:59,190
the silicone solidifies around the components to protect             

328
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,793
them from water damage.     

329
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:06,464
finally, he rivets the cover to the fabric.          

330
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,534
this foldable solar charger is ready to be bundled up    

331
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,936
and placed in a backpack.    

332
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,806
it can power a laptop or a smartphone,         

333
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:18,343
keeping the user connected anywhere in the world.             

334
