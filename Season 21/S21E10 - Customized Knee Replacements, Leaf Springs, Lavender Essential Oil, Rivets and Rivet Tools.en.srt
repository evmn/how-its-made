00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,854
narrator: the typical candidate
for a knee replacement     

4
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,122
has osteoarthritis,      

5
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,192
where the cartilage in the knee
has worn away.         

6
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,860
knee replacement surgery    

7
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,862
restores the worn areas with an implant.        

8
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,131
to help place the implant properly,     

9
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,134
the surgeon can use an instrument custom-designed 

10
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,604
for the patient's damaged anatomy.        

11
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,141
a successful knee replacement 

12
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:18,077
depends on its alignment with the femur and tibia,   

13
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,614
the upper and lower leg bones that connect at the knee.   

14
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:25,017
that's a challenge because knee implants are standard,  

15
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,486
while every patient's bones are unique.          

16
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,689
so starting with an mri scan of the patient's knee,     

17
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,424
this medical device company  

18
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,361
produces custom-made surgical templates,       

19
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,563
plastic devices the surgeon uses

20
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,432
to sculpt the surface the patient's bones      

21
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,102
to align the knee implant accurately.          

22
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:46,505
the surgeon no longer has to  
visually calculate the bone cuts

23
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,641
on the spot in the operating room,     

24
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,911
which takes more time and is more invasive.     

25
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:53,846
an engineer uses the mri scan 

26
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:57,583
to create 3-d models of the patient's femur and tibia. 

27
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,987
the patient's cartilage has  
worn out in between these bones,

28
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,924
causing painful rubbing that erodes the bone surface. 

29
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:10,529
the implant effectively replaces
the damaged bone and cartilage. 

30
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,465
once each bone model is ready, 

31
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,667
another engineer applies a 3-d model      

32
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,403
of the correct-size implant,  

33
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,206
then, following directions the surgeon has provided,    

34
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,808
performs virtual surgery on the bone model.       

35
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,144
this will properly align the implant          

36
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,413
to the patient's specific anatomy        

37
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:31,217
and fit it to the angle at which
that particular knee moves.  

38
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,619
during the surgery simulation, 

39
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,689
the computer records every bone cut.        

40
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,692
the surgeon reviews and approves this surgical plan

41
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,561
only once before manufacturing begins.  

42
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,365
the computer, which recorded the bone cuts, 

43
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,101
guides a 3-d printer to produce plastic templates  

44
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,704
for both the femur and tibia. 

45
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,238
the surgeon will use these   

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,775
to repeat the same exact cuts in real life.         

47
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,844
the 3-d printer applies a layer
of powdered plastic,      

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,046
then following the computer model,      

49
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,449
solidifies select areas with a laser.         

50
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,519
this process keeps repeating, 

51
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,122
building up the shape of these surgical templates  

52
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,457
layer by layer.        

53
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,793
one printer run produces personalized templates     

54
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,062
for up to 50 patients at a time,

55
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,931
so the laser inscribes the patient's name       

56
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,535
and identification code on each part.         

57
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,940
once the printing's done, it's just a matter       

58
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,277
of breaking up the unsolidified
powdered plastic...      

59
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,752
...and fishing out the templates.         

60
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,870
they brush off the bulk of the remaining powder.    

61
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,106
the posts on the bottom    

62
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,909
are the points at which pins affix the template to the bone 

63
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,978
during surgery.        

64
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,383
next, the templates go into a tumbler         

65
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,153
containing plastic balls and air jets.         

66
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,193
as the drum rotates for 20 minutes,        

67
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,929
the balls knock off and the air jets blows off   

68
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,731
most of the remaining powder. 

69
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,440
the templates exit the tumbler 90% clean.           

70
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,942
they go through two wash cycles

71
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,011
to remove the last remnants of powder.           

72
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:44,216
before packaging, they'll be sterilized.     

73
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,219
but first, every template must pass    

74
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,622
a quality-control inspection. 

75
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:53,025
using a laser, a technician scans it     

76
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,160
to make sure the manufacturing process   

77
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,630
produced an exact match to the patient's bone.     

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,776
this model shows how the femur and tibia form the knee joint  

79
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,046
and how the surgeon secures the customized template    

80
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,515
onto each of these bones.   

81
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,850
thanks to these devices,    

82
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:20,652
the surgeon doesn't have to figure out the bone cuts    

83
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,055
on the fly in the operating room.     

84
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,258
they're all pre-calculated by the computer model.     

85
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,860
this method eliminates several steps required     

86
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,063
in standard surgery.      

87
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,265
the operation takes less time 

88
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,067
and requires half as many instruments    

89
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,936
to set up and clean up.    

90
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,670
and because the surgeon    

91
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,872
no longer has to drill a hole in the bone          

92
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,875
to check the knee implant's alignment,           

93
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:46,077
the patient experiences less pain and bleeding     

94
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,582
and a smaller chance of developing complications.  

95
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,498
narrator: the earliest version of leaf springs        

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
were likely flexible wooden poles     

97
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,236
used in carriages in ancient rome.        

98
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,972
in the early 19th century,   

99
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,240
metal leaf springs were developed.        

100
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,709
today the journey continues,  

101
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:22,147
and it's fairly smooth thanks to these suspension springs.  

102
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:29,922
a leaf spring is a stack of curved plates or leaves,  

103
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,324
or sometimes even just one.  

104
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,859
this spring has the flex    

105
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,328
to absorb bumps and dips in the road,          

106
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,064
but it's strong enough to provide serious support.  

107
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,867
today these super-strong suspension springs       

108
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,404
are generally used for trucks and other heavy vehicles    

109
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,339
more than cars.        

110
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:50,675
production starts with spring steel.       

111
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,812
it's an alloy that has elasticity.      

112
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:57,149
big shears cut the steel to various lengths       

113
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,084
for a multi-leaf spring.    

114
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,955
it's one of the two kinds of leaf springs.        

115
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,289
using a band saw,       

116
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,691
they cut steel for the other kind of leaf spring,      

117
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,229
known as a full taper spring. 

118
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,097
it's made of one to four leaves

119
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,767
that are approximately the same
length but various thicknesses.

120
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,837
after cutting, they rapidly heat the ends.  

121
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,441
computerized machinery rolls and stretches the piece 

122
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,576
to a tapered profile.     

123
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,912
this achieves the same flex effect      

124
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:30,515
as the progressively shorter  
leaves on the multi-leaf spring,

125
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:35,053
but the end product will be lighter and not as stiff.   

126
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,924
next, it's into a press that trims the stretched ends 

127
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,960
and punches holes for various components.    

128
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,661
it takes about an hour     

129
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,266
for the steel to cool down for the next operation.    

130
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,404
meanwhile, other members of the team   

131
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,407
are hard at work on the multi-leaf spring.   

132
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,943
they feed the heated tip of the main leaf        

133
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:01,780
to a machine that wraps it around a die form.       

134
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,618
this creates an eye mount   

135
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,888
for attaching the spring to the vehicle.        

136
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,459
they create an eye mount on the other end, as well.   

137
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:22,834
next they curl the ends of a slightly longer steel bar 

138
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,303
into a loose "c" shape.    

139
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,173
this piece will serve as an outer protective wrap  

140
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,976
for the main leaf and protect the eye mounts.  

141
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,044
back to the taper spring,   

142
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:37,048
hydraulic machinery bends it to the final "z" shape     

143
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,185
so it will fit around a vehicle axle.        

144
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,655
they soak both the taper and multi-leaf springs in oil 

145
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:47,126
and temper them in a furnace to strengthen the steel.    

146
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:51,263
then it's time for a process known as peening.       

147
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,998
machinery clamps the steel leaf onto a carriage,

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,801
which takes it through a chamber

149
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,937
for blasting with tiny steel pellets.    

150
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,739
the blasting changes the surface tension,  

151
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,809
further strengthening the metal.

152
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,745
a worker now assembles the multi-leaf spring.     

153
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,014
he inserts a pin through the center of the main leaf  

154
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,150
and wrap to align them.    

155
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,220
each of the next leaves is shorter than the last.   

156
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,489
they're known as graduated leaves.      

157
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,293
it's a design that will make the spring more flexible.   

158
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,532
he transfers the stack to a hydraulic station...   

159
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:32,337
...and inserts a different pin for more precise alignment.  

160
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,841
he activates the hydraulic mechanism,    

161
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,843
and it squeezes the leaves together.      

162
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:42,381
the mechanism maintains the leaves under tension    

163
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:45,951
as he removes the pin and now bolts them together.  

164
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,793
he pounds clips installed at  
specific locations on the spring

165
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,130
to close them around the leaves.       

166
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:02,867
the clips tighten the stack all the way across       

167
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,804
and will stop the leaves from twisting or turning.   

168
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,541
next, another hydraulic device applies pressure,       

169
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:13,211
this time to simulate the load the spring will carry.     

170
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,414
this sets the spring to a specific height      

171
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,418
and compresses it to stiffen the overall performance.    

172
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,819
the worker measures the spring 

173
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,490
to confirm that it meets the specifications.      

174
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,692
the assembled leaf springs   

175
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,829
now take a quick dip in a tank of black paint.   

176
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,837
the paint coats the leaves, clips, and fasteners      

177
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,774
to give these suspension springs
a uniform finish.       

178
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,644
painted black, they should blend in      

179
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,981
with all the other components on the vehicle's undercarriage.

180
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,520
now complete, these leaf springs
can be depended on for support 

181
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,723
when the going gets rough.   

182
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,008
narrator: <i> lavandula angustifolia</i>    

183
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,811
might sound like a name of an ancient roman emperor,  

184
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,214
but it's actually the scientific
name for the lavender plant.  

185
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,550
the leaves and striking blue petals    

186
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,485
of this aromatic flowering shrub

187
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,021
are used to make lavender essential oil,    

188
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,958
an ingredient in many health and beauty products.      

189
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:39,231
lavender essential oil has antiviral, antibacterial, 

190
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,566
and anti-inflammatory properties.          

191
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,236
no wonder it's long been a natural remedy        

192
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,037
for many ailments.       

193
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,907
and with its flowery fragrance and relaxing effects,     

194
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:54,213
it's a common ingredient in lotions, soaps, and bath oils. 

195
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,850
lavender is a perennial plant 

196
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,653
that begins flowering in its second year.      

197
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,990
harvest time at this canadian farm is in july,   

198
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,192
at the peak of the first bloom.

199
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,728
there's a second bloom afterward,           

200
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,665
but not significant enough to warrant another harvest.  

201
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,002
weeds like to grow at the base of lavender plants,      

202
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:20,405
siphoning off water and important soil nutrients. 

203
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,074
so between may and september, 

204
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,876
killing those weeds is a vital daily ritual.    

205
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,278
the weeding machine      

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,881
lifts the lavender stems out of the way,        

207
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,118
then blasts the weeds around the base with hot steam.

208
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,695
to determine the right time to harvest,   

209
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,164
the producer looks at the quantity of blooms   

210
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,568
and the color of the flowers. 

211
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,369
they should be purple-blue,  

212
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,971
on the verge of turning grayish-brown.   

213
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,975
the producer also crushes a few petals   

214
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,177
to see how much oil comes out. 

215
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,848
the harvester is specially designed for cutting lavender. 

216
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,252
like a stylist cutting hair,  

217
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:11,590
it pulls the stem straight up, then snips near the base.   

218
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,933
the cut stems, about 15 inches long,     

219
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:26,604
fall onto a conveyer belt, which moves them into a tray. 

220
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:30,208
from there, workers manually transfer the lavender     

221
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,144
to the harvester's trailer.  

222
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,079
when the trailer is full,   

223
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:38,684
the harvester delivers its load
to the on-site distillery.   

224
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,686
workers load the lavender into a still,         

225
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,488
a large stainless-steel vessel 

226
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,291
typically used to produce alcoholic spirits.       

227
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,231
they compact as much lavender as possible into the still   

228
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,968
to prevent the formation of air pockets.        

229
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,038
the less air, the greater the oil yield.   

230
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,185
once the still is stuffed to compacted capacity,     

231
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,719
they close it tightly     

232
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,123
and start up an oil-fired boiler.      

233
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,325
the boiler heats water into steam,    

234
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,595
which they then inject into the bottom of the still  

235
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,863
at very low pressure.     

236
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,465
over the course of about 15 minutes,      

237
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,668
the steam slowly rises to the top of the still,    

238
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,071
heating the lavender along the way.         

239
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,808
they continue the steam for another half-hour or so.  

240
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,545
this bursts the glands     
located primarily in the petals,

241
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,848
releasing the oil.       

242
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,754
to collect that extracted oil, 

243
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:51,222
they feed cold water into a coiled pipe       

244
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,758
running through the still.   

245
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,294
when the hot steam hits that cold pipe,      

246
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,564
it condenses, transforming back into water. 

247
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,701
only now, the water contains lavender oil.         

248
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:05,904
they open the still's tap   

249
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,874
and let the water flow into a holding tank.      

250
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,980
on average, the proportions are      

251
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:20,552
one part lavender oil to 40 parts water.       

252
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:27,926
in the holding tank over the next hour or so,   

253
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,396
the oil naturally separates and rises to the surface.   

254
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,730
at that point,         

255
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,800
they begin pumping the water to another container,     

256
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,603
stopping at the first sign of oil.   

257
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,606
what remains in the tank is the final product --     

258
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,609
pure lavender essential oil.  

259
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,877
the pumped-out water      

260
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,281
is a secondary product called lavender flower water. 

261
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:54,419
the producer sends both products
to a laboratory to be filtered. 

262
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:58,689
producers primarily sell lavender oil and floral water 

263
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:03,361
as ingredients to manufacturers
of health and beauty products, 

264
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,896
but they also often design   

265
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,165
their own lines of lavender creations     

266
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,734
for pampering the body and soul.

267
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:28,053
narrator: rivets hold a lot of things together.   

268
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,854
product fabricated with rivets 

269
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,857
include aircraft, cars, computers,        

270
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,526
and household appliances.   

271
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,461
installed with a rivet tool,  

272
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:40,131
these fasteners create strong and permanent joints.  

273
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,635
without rivets, a lot of things
might fall apart.       

274
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,140
whether the job is large or small,       

275
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,209
chances are there's a rivet for it.    

276
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,944
and using a special rivet tool,

277
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:57,616
it's possible to form strong attachments quickly and easily.

278
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:02,753
the two together make a perfect match.     

279
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,291
the rivet tool starts with a precast aluminum handle.

280
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,960
a technician inserts a steel sleeve.    

281
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,030
it will serve as a chamber for hydraulic fluid.      

282
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:15,299
the spring for the tool's trigger is next.  

283
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,235
she screws an aluminum plate to the base          

284
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,572
to enclose the two parts and the handle.        

285
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,175
this is the pulling-head assembly.   

286
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:27,311
it has tiny jaws to grab the rivet stem.    

287
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,647
she lubricates it       

288
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:33,451
and presses it into the main bore of the rivet tool.    

289
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,722
she installs a fill screw   
in the top of the handle casting

290
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,726
for top-offs of hydraulic fluid
during servicing.       

291
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,262
but the initial supply of hydraulic fluid       

292
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,198
is added through the steel sleeve at the bottom.

293
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,801
she inserts an air-piston assembly     

294
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,936
into the fluid-filled chamber. 

295
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,673
she threads a screw into the nose of the rivet tool.  

296
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,676
this keeps the internal workings
in the correct position    

297
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:59,344
for the next step.       

298
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,747
she places the base of the tool
into an air chamber,      

299
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,349
then hooks up an air hose   

300
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,550
and secures it with steel clamps.       

301
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,552
she plugs the tool into an air supply       

302
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,887
and pulls the trigger.     

303
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,424
the air puts pressure on the hydraulic fluid inside 

304
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,160
to activate the riveting mechanism.    

305
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,363
and now the test --      

306
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,898
she places a rivet in the nose of the tool,    

307
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,101
then inserts the other end of the rivet   

308
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,703
into a hole on the test plate 

309
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,237
and presses the trigger.    

310
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,374
the tool efficiently installs the rivet in the hole.     

311
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:34,245
it's time to stock up on rivets.
they make them from round wire. 

312
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,514
a machine cuts the wire to length    

313
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,850
and then punches it into a die twice        

314
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:42,854
to form a rivet stem blank.  

315
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,993
here's the cutting and forming action in slow motion.     

316
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,334
the machine operates in a blur,

317
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,804
producing 200 rivet stem blanks a minute.  

318
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,210
the stem blanks move between serrated rolling dies. 

319
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,612
the dies form grooves     

320
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,748
to allow the stem to be gripped
by a rivet tool.        

321
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,152
they also make ridges that will serve as a breaking point 

322
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,753
during rivet installation.   

323
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,223
this is a slow-motion close-up 

324
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,626
of the serrated rolling dies in action.           

325
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:27,732
here's the rivet stem before and after forming.   

326
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,436
the next machine creates the rivet body.    

327
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,838
it cuts wire to the correct length     

328
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,975
and forces it into dies.    

329
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:41,513
it takes five punches to transform the solid wire  

330
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,214
into a hollow rivet body.   

331
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,890
these machines can produce up to 300 parts a minute.    

332
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:59,130
next, the rivet bodies go for a tumble in a cleaning solution

333
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:03,000
to remove oily residue left by the forming.      

334
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,871
the rivet stems also undergo this thorough washing.     

335
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,941
the rivet bodies then travel through a furnace. 

336
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,944
the intense heat followed by a gradual cooling 

337
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,947
hardens the metal to free it from internal stresses.    

338
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,550
after zinc-plating,      

339
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,620
the rivet bodies head towards the next station. 

340
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,023
the rivet stems are also on the move.     

341
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,025
they travel through a channel that gradually widens     

342
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,896
to sort out stems that are too big or small.   

343
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,033
the undersized stems fall through at the beginning, 

344
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,036
and oversized ones fall off the end.        

345
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,172
a magnet loader collects the correctly sized stems,   

346
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,575
and rejects are discarded.   

347
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,645
the rivet stems cling to the loader,      

348
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,849
which is stopped at the moment.

349
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:54,652
the rivet bodies now ride a carrousel.     

350
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,053
it pauses briefly       

351
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,457
to allow a stem to be inserted into a body.  

352
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:05,596
these are slow-motion shots, and back in real time.     

353
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,465
these machines work fast.   

354
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,870
they pump out millions of rivets a day.   

355
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:16,541
the rivets are now ready to leave this factory for another,

356
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:20,478
where they could be used to make almost anything.    

357
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,958
