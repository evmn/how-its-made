00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,491
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,227
        car radiators...        

3
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,732
      ...hatchery chicks...     

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,705
       ...phyllo dough...       

5
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,544
   ...and cross-country skis.   

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,454
        when the gasoline       
     in a car engine burns,     

7
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:59,458
     up to 70% of the energy    
  generated converts into heat. 

8
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,195
       a lot of this heat       
  goes out the exhaust system,  

9
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,931
      but much of it stays      
     heating up the engine.     

10
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,134
    the car's cooling system    
      prevents overheating.     

11
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,304
   the system's key component   
        is the radiator.        

12
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,877
   a water-and-antifreeze mix   
        absorbs the heat        

13
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,879
    generated by the engine.    

14
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:25,350
  the fluid then flows through  
the radiator tubes to cool down.

15
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,420
       the tubes are made       
     from paper-thin brass.     

16
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,291
     the 1.5-inch-wide strip    

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,629
       is bent by rollers       
 into the shape of a flat tube. 

18
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,502
           the tubing           
     then runs through a vat    

19
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,472
  of bubbling-hot molten lead.  

20
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,313
  as the tubing exits the vat,  

21
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,450
   it runs through cold water   
 that hardens the lead coating. 

22
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,921
 a cutter then chops the tubing 
          into pieces,          

23
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,323
   the length of which varies   
     according to the model     

24
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,659
          of radiator.          

25
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,595
 these are about 30 inches long.

26
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,933
   meanwhile, another machine   
      shapes a narrow strip     

27
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,069
            of copper           
   just 6/100 of an inch thick  

28
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,239
      into what are called      
         "cooling fins."        

29
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,575
  as we'll see in slow motion,  

30
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,878
        the machine folds       
  the copper strip like a fan,  

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,949
       then perforates it,      
    creating mini air vents.    

32
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,484
       when the hot fluid       
     runs through the tubes,    

33
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,621
    these fins will transfer    
            the heat            

34
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,223
       to the air flowing       
      through the radiator.     

35
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,225
        the cooled fluid        
        can then go back        

36
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,629
        for another round       
    of absorbing engine heat.   

37
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,098
    the cooling fins come out   
   of the machine cut to size.  

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,836
   then workers manually stack  
       the tubes and fins       

39
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,704
    one on top of the other.    

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,844
    they straighten them out    

41
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,779
and apply a brass tag indicating
        the model number        

42
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,650
     and date of production.    

43
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,320
  then they compress and strap  
    the components together.    

44
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:14,526
  elsewhere, a computer-guided  
  machine punches out a pattern 

45
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,595
        on brass sheets.        

46
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,264
        these will become       
   what are called "headers."   

47
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,067
           there's one          
   on each side of a radiator.  

48
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,670
        the punching tool       
    then changes to a knife,    

49
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,272
         which now cuts         
  along the perforation lines.  

50
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,250
         using a press,         
     they bend each header.     

51
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,523
        then punch slots        
    for the radiator's tubes.   

52
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,034
      now, using a mallet,      

53
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,037
     they hammer the headers    
   onto the ends of the tubes.  

54
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,374
    the banging inadvertently   
       closes a few tubes,      

55
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,910
  so they use a special roller  
         to reopen them.        

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,379
   after cleaning the surface,  

57
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,984
        it's into an oven       
   at 600 degrees fahrenheit.   

58
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,053
      in just two minutes,      
         the lead melts,        

59
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,889
        fusing the tubes        
        and cooling fins.       

60
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,393
     after straightening out    
       any crooked tubes,       

61
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,530
     workers dip the headers    
  in a tank of hot-liquid lead  

62
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,998
         for 30 seconds.        

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,669
        this solders them       
  to the sides of the radiator. 

64
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,808
     they apply a few drops     
     of lead on the corners     

65
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,210
       for reinforcement.       

66
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,950
  the headers and tube openings 
    are now encased in lead.    

67
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,887
    workers now feed a sheet    
      of brass into a press     

68
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,858
        to form the tanks       
    that go onto the headers.   

69
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,895
   one contains a brass tube.   

70
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,767
 hot transmission oil enters one
 end of it and exits the other, 

71
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,468
     cooling along the way.     

72
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,241
  once workers finish soldering 
    the tanks to the headers,   

73
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,111
         they solder on         
  what's called the filler net, 

74
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,415
 a spout for pouring antifreeze 
         into the tank.         

75
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,453
   on the opposite tank, they   
 solder on a water-intake pipe. 

76
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,189
  this will be the entry point  

77
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,224
          for the fluid         
      heated by the engine.     

78
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,795
       finally, they coat       
      the finished radiator     

79
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,798
in an asphalt-based black paint.

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,935
       the asphalt content      
 makes the paint heat resistant 

81
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,971
   and protects the radiator's  
          cooling fins.         

82
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,750
   narrator: which came first,  
     the chicken or the egg?    

83
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,951
    it's an age-old question,   

84
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,621
     and we can't give you      
     the definitive answer.     

85
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,623
       but we can take you      
          to a hatchery         

86
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,625
to see how baby chicks are bred.

87
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,563
       it's the first step      
 in commercial chicken farming, 

88
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,999
       or the second step       
if you think the egg came first.

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,038
      chicks come from eggs     
      fertilized by mating,     

90
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,574
     but a hen can lay eggs     
         without mating.        

91
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,911
     those unfertilized eggs    
      are the ones we eat.      

92
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,513
       the fertilized ones      
       go to the hatchery       

93
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,983
       three or four days       
       after being laid.        

94
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:28,786
    hatchery workers transfer   
 the eggs onto special trolleys,

95
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,922
       then roll them into      
         the incubator,         

96
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,391
      where the temperature     
       and humidity level       

97
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,727
    mimic natural conditions.   

98
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,264
  the egg yolk, egg white, and  
  shell all nourish the embryo. 

99
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,535
           every hour,          
   the trays shift 45 degrees   

100
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,537
 to the opposite side and back, 

101
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,939
           simulating           
  the way hens turn their eggs  

102
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,875
          while waiting         
       for them to hatch.       

103
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,012
       after 18 1/2 days,       

104
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,882
 the eggs come out of incubation
  and go onto a conveyer belt.  

105
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,551
            they pass           
    under an infrared sensor    

106
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,221
      that checks for eggs      
    that are too transparent.   

107
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,359
   these are unfertilized eggs  
      that slipped through.     

108
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,563
       the sensor triggers      
a suction device to remove them.

109
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,201
  they go to a rendering plant  
     to become animal feed.     

110
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,372
  the fertilized eggs continue  
    along to the next station   

111
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,176
 to be vaccinated against marek,
       a poultry disease.       

112
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,112
        automated needles       
   pierce a hole in each shell  

113
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,647
      and inject a vaccine      

114
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,551
     into the amniotic fluid    
     surrounding the chick.     

115
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:40,792
 now a suction device transfers 
   the eggs to hatching trays,  

116
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,929
       168 eggs per tray.       

117
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,666
        about 150 of them       
    can be expected to hatch.   

118
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,437
   the rest die in incubation   
   or have physical defects.    

119
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,409
            day 19 --           
   the chicks use their beaks   

120
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,611
         to crack a hole        
       through the shell,       

121
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:03,081
     then a horizontal line     
           all around.          

122
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,083
    after six to eight hours,   

123
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,519
    the chicks finally emerge   
         from the shell.        

124
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,424
    they're covered in short    
    feathers called "down,"     

125
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,627
        and they're able        
        to walk and see.        

126
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,331
     after about four hours,    
      their down has dried.     

127
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,836
 now workers roll the chicks to 
  what's called the separator,  

128
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,306
    a machine that separates    
the birds from the shell halves.

129
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,044
      the shells are larger     
        than the chicks,        

130
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,980
       so they stay on top      

131
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:38,149
   while the chicks fall down   
   to a conveyer belt below.    

132
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,059
           the shells,          
   which are high in calcium,   

133
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,328
    go to a rendering plant.    

134
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:02,040
    the chicks move on to be    
 classified according to gender.

135
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,348
     workers put the females    
         down one chute,        

136
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,017
     the males down another.    

137
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,888
    they determine the sex by   
 checking two rows of feathers. 

138
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,424
      if one row's shorter      
         than the other,        

139
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,859
      the chick's a female.     

140
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,664
if the rows are the same height,
          it's a male.          

141
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,905
        each chute feeds        
    a separate conveyer belt.   

142
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,415
    an optical counter tracks   
the number of males and females.

143
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,326
       the chicks now fall      

144
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,129
     into specially designed    
      transportation boxes,     

145
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,865
       102 chicks per box.      

146
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,934
      some clients request      

147
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,938
 that their order of chicks be  
 vaccinated against bronchitis. 

148
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,075
        those boxes pass        
    under an aerosol sprayer    

149
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,612
       that sprinkles them      
  with a mild dose of vaccine.  

150
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,883
  poultry farmers raise chicks  
     for their meat or eggs.    

151
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,420
 females used for egg production
        begin laying eggs       

152
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,222
    at about 20 weeks of age.   

153
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,757
      for meat production,      

154
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,293
 females reach slaughter weight 
        at about 38 days.       

155
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,562
males, depending on market size,

156
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,166
    take from 40 to 65 days.    

157
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,310
            narrator:           
     if you like greek food,    

158
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,979
   then you've probably tasted  
            baklava.            

159
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,916
  it's made with a paper-thin,  
  flaky dough called "phyllo,"  

160
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,586
   the greek word for "leaf."   

161
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,590
       phyllo dough itself      
is low-fat and cholesterol-free.

162
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:03,428
    unfortunately, the stuff    
they usually fill it with isn't.

163
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,534
phyllo dough can be made by hand
         or by machine.         

164
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,338
      either way, it starts     
   with the same dough recipe.  

165
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,610
   the proportions are roughly  
     40% water to 60% flour.    

166
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,878
       they use two types       
       of wheat flour --        

167
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,282
   high-protein flour to make   
  the dough strong and flexible 

168
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:28,486
      and low-protein flour     
   to make its texture smooth.  

169
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,955
     they also add sorbate,     
         a preservative,        

170
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,825
     to increase shelf life.    

171
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,829
     after about 15 minutes     
 of mixing, the dough is ready. 

172
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,163
     they cut off a section     

173
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,966
   and feed it into a machine   
       called the divider,      

174
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,969
       which transforms it      
     into a cylindrical wad.    

175
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,506
     they hand-roll the wad     
       into a rough ball,       

176
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,642
 then feed it two or three times
        through a machine       

177
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,645
      that kneads the dough     
   into a rounder, harder ball  

178
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,848
       with no air bubbles      
         trapped inside.        

179
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,884
  they can tell when it's ready 
       just by feeling it.      

180
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,789
      then a machine called     
  the sheeter flattens the ball 

181
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,558
      into what looks like      
          pizza dough.          

182
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,996
  workers stack about 30 sheets 
   with craft paper in between  

183
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,232
 to absorb some of the moisture.

184
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,405
       now the key step --      
       opening the dough.       

185
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:26,076
 first, they lay a large cotton 
  cloth over the work surface.  

186
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,548
     it must be 100% cotton     
     to absorb the moisture.    

187
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,017
           otherwise,           
 the dough would stick together.

188
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,354
  they take the sheet of dough  
 and begin stretching it by hand

189
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:40,291
    until it's approximately    
         27 square feet.        

190
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,760
      even though the dough     
       is stretched thin,       

191
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,362
        it doesn't tear.        

192
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,365
       this is due partly       
     to its protein content     

193
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,201
           and partly           
   to the skill of the worker.  

194
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,514
     they repeat the process    
       with all 30 sheets,      

195
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,284
          stacking them         
    one on top of the other.    

196
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,259
 then they take a plank of wood,
   called a "sanida" in greek,  

197
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,128
    and roll the dough sheets   
       onto it one by one,      

198
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,965
       removing the cloths      
      that were in between.     

199
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,074
    they sprinkle corn starch   

200
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,411
          on the dough,         
just enough to prevent sticking.

201
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,481
      too much corn starch      
      will burn the dough.      

202
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,487
    now they move the sanida    
        to another table        

203
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,357
     and cut along one side     
          of the dough.         

204
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,060
      they remove the wood      
    and open the sheets flat.   

205
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:55,433
    then they cut rectangles    
    measuring 13x17 inches,     

206
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,402
      standard phyllo size.     

207
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,706
   each sheet of phyllo dough   
        is about as thin        

208
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,375
   as a sheet of tissue paper,  

209
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,445
         but it's strong        
 and flexible enough not to tear

210
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,046
   when a baker works with it.  

211
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,851
    machine-made phyllo dough   
    is a much faster method,    

212
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,587
used primarily for mass-produced
       frozen-food items.       

213
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,190
      an automated machine      
      called the stretcher      

214
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,659
  transforms a big wad of dough 

215
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,128
    into a thin, flat sheet,    

216
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,531
 applying just the right amount 
         of corn starch.        

217
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,800
    a continuous air current    
     coming from underneath     

218
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,135
     creates an air bubble.     

219
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,338
           the height           
    of the bubble tells them    

220
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,274
        whether the dough       
    is the right consistency.   

221
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,277
         the dough dries        
      under infrared lamps.     

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,413
     this step is necessary     

223
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,083
       because this method      
     doesn't use craft paper    

224
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,486
   and cotton cloths to absorb  
      the excess moisture.      

225
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,823
    the dried sheet of dough    
       rolls onto a spool.      

226
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,558
     they cut along the side    
      to release the dough      

227
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,361
        and lay it flat.        

228
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,095
        using a template,       

229
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,364
            they cut            
  the standard size rectangle,  

230
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,167
    yielding about 800 sheets   
        of phyllo dough.        

231
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,774
    they roll about 20 sheets   
       together at a time       

232
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,776
    and wrap them in plastic.   

233
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,546
     then, they vacuum-pack     
   and heat-seal the package.   

234
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,121
    phyllo dough stays fresh    

235
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,058
          for six weeks         
      in the refrigerator,      

236
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,294
   six months in the freezer.   

237
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,605
  narrator: cross-country skis  

238
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,274
    used to look pretty much    
         all the same --        

239
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,476
    long, narrow, and wooden.   

240
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:50,081
     today's skis, however,     
 come in many different styles, 

241
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,551
 specifically designed for the  
 many types of cross-country -- 

242
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,620
     telemark, back-country,    

243
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,756
      all-terrain, touring,     
           and racing.          

244
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,864
  archeologists in scandinavia  

245
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:11,168
  have uncovered ski artifacts  
        5,000 years old.        

246
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,170
      these stone-age skis      

247
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,240
         enabled people         
   to hunt during the winter.   

248
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,644
     skiing became so vital     
    a means of transportation   

249
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:24,515
  that the vikings worshipped   
  a god and goddess of skiing.  

250
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,119
    19th-century scandinavian   
       soldiers wore skis       

251
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,720
       in winter warfare.       

252
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,190
         they held races        
      in their spare time,      

253
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,526
  turning cross-country skiing  
      into a popular sport.     

254
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,830
 from there, it just snowballed.

255
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:50,007
  one way to make cross-country 
  skis is compression molding,  

256
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,477
            a process           
   that uses heat and pressure  

257
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,146
to bond the components together.

258
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,148
 first, a computer-guided blade 

259
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,418
    cuts out what will become   
      the ski's underside,      

260
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,952
   called the gliding surface.  

261
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,621
   it's made of pre-assembled   
       fiberglass laminate      

262
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:09,026
 and polyethylene thermoplastic,
 a friction-resistant material. 

263
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,695
they lay it into the bottom half
           of a mold,           

264
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,699
    then glue on steel edges    
            for grip.           

265
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,035
           this spray           
  makes the adhesive dry faster 

266
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,707
     so that they can apply     
the principle adhesive -- epoxy.

267
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,110
     a rubber shock absorber    
        goes on the back,       

268
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,179
           followed by          
 a durable plastic reinforcement

269
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,316
             called             
    the heel-piece protector.   

270
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,851
      the ski's wooden core     

271
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,988
        is made of aspen        
  and birch laminated together. 

272
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:42,526
next comes a sheet of fiberglass
     impregnated with epoxy     

273
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,662
    for extra reinforcement.    

274
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,396
          the wood core         

275
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,334
    is now sandwiched between   
   two high-resistance layers.  

276
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,336
      then, for decoration,     

277
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,473
         a plastic film         
   with a silk-screen design.   

278
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,542
       with everything now      
 in the bottom half of the mold,

279
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,344
      they clamp on the top     

280
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,815
    and tape it up to ensure    
  nothing shifts out of place.  

281
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,953
     then it's into a press     
    that compresses the mold    

282
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:13,157
          and heats it          
   to 185 degrees fahrenheit.   

283
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,359
    this activates the epoxy,   

284
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,061
          hardening it          
      in 12 to 15 minutes,      

285
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,431
   depending on the thickness   
           of the ski.          

286
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,674
     now they do a rough cut    
     to trim off the excess.    

287
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,917
  then they sand all the edges  
      until they're smooth.     

288
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,731
  they run the gliding surface  
    across a grinding stone,    

289
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,668
that white object you see below.

290
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,372
     this extra step is only    
   for the higher-end models.   

291
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,944
       another way to make      
       cross-country skis       

292
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:10,948
     is by a process called     
   reaction-injection molding.  

293
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,084
        first, they place       
      the skis' top layer,      

294
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:18,422
    a fiberglass-epoxy sheet,   
         in the mold...         

295
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:19,624
    then the gliding surface,   

296
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,493
      made of pre-assembled     
       fiberglass laminate      

297
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,163
        and polyethylene        
 with a high-resistance backing.

298
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,299
    instead of a wooden core    
         in the middle,         

299
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,669
       this press injects       
   a super-resilient plastic.   

300
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,508
     in just three seconds,     
  the injection phase is over,  

301
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,510
 and the reaction phase begins. 

302
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,481
       this demonstration       
       shows what happens.      

303
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,987
             first,             
  the polyurethane inflates...  

304
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,961
       ...then it hardens.      

305
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,464
      after eight minutes,      

306
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,866
      it's hardened enough      
    to come out of the mold.    

307
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,604
     they let the ski cure      
     for up to eight hours,     

308
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,205
         at which point         
       it's strong enough       

309
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,907
      to support the weight     
           of a skier.          

310
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,013
 now, these three components -- 

311
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,616
         the top layer,         
    the polyurethane middle,    

312
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,219
   and the gliding surface --   
            are one.            

313
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,155
    now comes the finishing.    

314
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,693
         first they trim        
      and bevel the edges.      

315
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,395
 they sand the gliding surface. 

316
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,966
    then they carve a groove    
        down its length.        

317
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,903
       this gives the ski       
     directional stability.     

318
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,709
    all that's left to do now   
      is decorate the skis.     

319
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,444
   first the background color   

320
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,980
       and a quick-drying,      
     solvent-based lacquer.     

321
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,320
 they apply the design manually,
      one color at a time,      

322
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,789
              using             
   the silk-screening process.  

323
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,126
    a typical design consists   
    of five to seven colors,    

324
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,528
    including the background.   

325
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,597
        to keep the skis        
        looking vibrant,        

326
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,401
   they protect the paint with  
 a coat of transparent varnish.
