captions paid for by discovery communications, inc. 

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,424
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,193
lighters...          

5
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,899
...fossils...         

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,705
...hockey pucks...       

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,544
...and high-pressure cylinders.

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,853
it's a case for combustion.  

9
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,589
spin the wheel, and you have an instant flame. 

10
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,325
flip the lid, and the flame is extinguished. 

11
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,996
a version of the lighter first appeared in the 19th century.  

12
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,330
at the time,          

13
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,534
it was more of a conversation piece than anything,      

14
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:11,437
a curiosity that received plenty of interest.      

15
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,612
lighters aren't a novelty anymore,            

16
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,681
but they're still used every day.           

17
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,149
to make lighter cases,     

18
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,686
a machine uncoils brass from a spool, pulling it to a press.

19
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,222
the press stamps the brass repeatedly           

20
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,826
to shape both the top and bottom parts of the case. 

21
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,229
a worker collects them     

22
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,832
and places them on a revolving table.     

23
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,968
another worker slides on a hinge

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,505
to link the top and bottom pieces.       

25
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,181
an electrode welds the hinge to the case.          

26
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,917
then a mechanical arm knocks them down a chute    

27
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,487
to a worker who inspects the welding job.        

28
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,860
as the cases move on a conveyor system,     

29
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,164
they get a quick buff to prepare them for plating.  

30
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,601
the lighter cases       

31
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,405
are now plunged into a series 
of washing solutions and rinses,

32
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,876
followed by a nickel solution...

33
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,477
then a chrome one.       

34
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,381
it's the finishing touch for the lighter cases.     

35
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:35,353
it's time to move on to the inner workings.     

36
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,291
a die shapes a piece of steel to make the inside cases.   

37
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:48,367
mechanized arms then place a tube and plate in the case. 

38
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,369
the tube will hold the flint stone,   

39
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,539
and the plate will form the top
of the inner case.       

40
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,046
epoxy seals them in place,   

41
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:05,017
and the cases move through a  
curing oven to harden the epoxy.

42
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,122
a worker arranges a pile of flint wheels     

43
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:14,259
so that the teeth are in the proper direction.  

44
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:20,132
grippers load the flint wheels into an assembly jig.     

45
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:34,513
these cams will eventually act as a catch for the lighter lid.

46
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:41,987
a gripper places the cam in the jig beside the flint wheel.

47
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,094
the assembly jig now receives little brass eyelets      

48
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,163
between the flint wheel and the cam.          

49
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,042
the machine slides the     
inner case over the flint wheel,

50
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,045
cam, and eyelet.        

51
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:10,382
and an automated device rivets it all together.    

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,122
a machine lowers a wick to the eyelet and threads it through. 

53
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,297
blades move in from the side and snip the wick.       

54
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,138
this machine stuffs pieces of cotton into the inner case. 

55
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,940
the cotton will soak up    

56
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,409
and retain fuel        
when the consumer adds it later.

57
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,413
steel plungers tamp down the wick and cotton.      

58
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,587
here a die punch cuts a piece of felt to size. 

59
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,894
automated arms pick up the felt

60
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,897
and shove it into the top of the inner case.       

61
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,771
here grippers place a flint spring in the case   

62
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,406
just over the flint stone.   

63
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:14,313
pneumatic screwdrivers drive the screw home.      

64
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,251
a rubber wheel spins the flint,

65
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,755
and sparks fly as a light sensor
checks their intensity.    

66
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,331
after the flint check,     

67
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,668
technicians install the inner unit in the case.  

68
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,606
they check the fit.      

69
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,476
they test the function.    

70
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,678
and they're off to be shipped. 

71
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:02,294
narrator: it takes many hours of
work to make a fossil replica. 

72
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,963
real dinosaur bones, millions of years old,     

73
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,365
are used to make life-size renditions.     

74
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,567
you'll find these fossil facsimiles    

75
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,303
on display in museums.     

76
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,904
they're very exact,      

77
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,707
almost indistinguishable from the real thing.      

78
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,722
the dinosaur looms large once again, brought back to life  

79
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,993
thanks to an evolution in casting techniques.     

80
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,462
building these replicas is a job

81
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:41,066
that can involve both high-tech
know-how and hands-on skill.  

82
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:49,074
they start with the real thing,
an ancient fossil.       

83
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,343
this is a dinosaur's upper jawbone.         

84
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,881
they laser-scan it, producing a three-dimensional image.   

85
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,887
the scanner feeds the image to a computer.         

86
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,025
then it's time to go to print. 

87
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,760
but this isn't an ink-and-paper job.     

88
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,764
this tray is filled with plaster powder.      

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,302
the printer outlines the jawbone
shape with a liquid hardener. 

90
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,306
the result is this plaster cast
of the jawbone.        

91
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:31,049
there is a more traditional way
to make a fossil replica.   

92
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,586
they arrange plywood around a fossil of this dinosaur foot.

93
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,255
then they lay sheets of clay on the wood          

94
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,658
and press it to the dinosaur bone.     

95
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,799
with a clay pick, they make a 90-degree angle at the bone 

96
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,734
to give it a clean line.    

97
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,269
using more clay,        

98
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,206
they build a spout and a riser at one end of the bone.    

99
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,210
they etch an i.d. number into the clay.         

100
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,947
then they paint liquid rubber onto the fossil        

101
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,382
and the abutting clay.     

102
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,829
they place fiber-glass sheets on the rubber,         

103
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,765
wetting it down with a polyester mix first.  

104
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,302
they work the fiber glass into the shape of the fossil, 

105
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,504
then paint a red gel coat onto it.            

106
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,240
it's a color code to identify the species --   

107
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,377
a duckbilled dinosaur called a lambeosaurus.     

108
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,187
now they have one side of a mold.           

109
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,991
when both sides of the mold are
fabricated, they pair them up, 

110
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,460
and this fossil mold is complete.          

111
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,998
the rubber layer inside picks up the fossil's detail, 

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,867
while the outer fiber-glass one
will hold the rubber rigid   

113
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,437
as they pour a polyester- and-water mix into the spout. 

114
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,712
it takes 45 minutes to harden. 

115
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,555
and now it's time for the big reveal.      

116
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,398
it's an exact replica.     

117
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:34,238
next they form part of the skull.       

118
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,308
they make this part with hollow fiber glass    

119
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,177
instead of solid polyester.  

120
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,247
this will ease the load on the steel framework later. 

121
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,316
all the larger bones are cast with hollow fiber glass    

122
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,885
because of weight issues.   

123
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,460
this is a mastodon head.    

124
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:05,203
they mold up to 300 pieces to 
produce these skeletal replicas.

125
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,010
on one side of the skeleton,  

126
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,814
they literally flesh out some details.         

127
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,083
they sculpt scales onto a clay-like fill     

128
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:22,153
to demonstrate how a dinosaur would look with some skin.   

129
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,689
the other side remains bare bones       

130
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,226
to give the viewer an inside look.        

131
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,829
a little glue completes the spine work.   

132
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,232
then they mount the skull.   

133
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:46,177
when the front leg goes on, this
2-sided fossil is ready to go. 

134
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,680
it's a real museum piece.   

135
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,397
narrator: early hockey pucks were made of wood.       

136
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,866
but for informal games,    

137
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,601
even objects like stones would suffice.         

138
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,138
eventually rubber became the puck material of choice.  

139
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,342
the modern puck is three inches
wide by one inch thick.    

140
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,877
pucks are usually frozen before games          

141
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,147
to reduce their bounce on the ice.          

142
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,419
11 different ingredients    

143
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,556
go into making these rubber hockey pucks.   

144
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,024
the recipe begins with natural rubber.      

145
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,694
two types of oil make the rubber durable.    

146
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,365
certain minerals act as curing agents and antiaging agents.  

147
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,234
and a form of coal dust, called carbon black,      

148
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,702
serves as a filler.      

149
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,639
workers feed the ingredients into a preliminary mixer --   

150
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,242
first the slabs of natural rubber,       

151
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:55,179
then antioxidants to lengthen the rubber's life-span,    

152
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,317
then one type of oil to help blend in the dry chemicals,   

153
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,321
then another type to refine the rubber's rigidity level,  

154
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,925
then additives such as calcium carbonate and sulfur  

155
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,727
to help cure the rubber during the molding process,  

156
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,797
and finally, the carbon black filler.    

157
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,072
after 10 to 15 minutes of this preliminary blending, 

158
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,875
the mixture goes down a chute and onto a conveyor belt,   

159
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,079
which transports it to a machine
called the mill mixer.     

160
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,949
it will perform the final mix. 

161
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,122
at this point,         
workers add more natural rubber.

162
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,634
then they add another, harder rubber         

163
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,437
that will make the hockey pucks
more resilient.        

164
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,775
the recipe is formulated to produce a very hard rubber, 

165
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,244
one that can stand up to the rigors         

166
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,512
of repeated blows from a hockey stick.      

167
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,248
it's critical that the ingredients blend evenly. 

168
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,785
that's why workers continually cut the rubber   

169
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,419
while it's mixing.       

170
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,405
in the company lab,      

171
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:32,410
technicians evaluate a sample from each batch.        

172
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,746
this device is called a rheometer.     

173
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,482
it analyzes what's called the curing curve --      

174
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,151
how the rubber hardens and to what degree.      

175
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,888
a computer compares the curing curve to the quality model.  

176
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,825
if they match, the batch gets the go-ahead.  

177
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:52,296
the rubber hasn't yet     
gone through the curing process,

178
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,232
so it's still malleable.    

179
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,502
an extrusion machine      
squeezes it through a round die.

180
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:02,640
this produces logs about 40  
inches long and 3 inches wide --

181
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,944
the exact diameter of the hockey puck.      

182
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,921
the next machine slices each log
like a loaf of bread      

183
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,923
into 39 pieces.        

184
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,626
each piece is 1.1 inches thick.

185
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,730
these pieces are called preforms

186
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,200
because at this stage they're not quite fully formed pucks. 

187
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,606
workers put them into compression molds     

188
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,942
that look like giant muffin pans.       

189
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,276
each mold cavity        

190
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,247
is the exact size of the finished hockey puck.  

191
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,428
a cover goes on.        

192
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,230
then the molds go into a curing press,    

193
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,300
which compresses the preforms 

194
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,103
and heats them to 300 degrees fahrenheit.   

195
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,642
it takes 18 minutes for the rubber to cure.    

196
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:13,244
the preforms come out as hockey pucks --       

197
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,314
rock-hard and 1/8 of an inch thinner than before.      

198
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,051
they cool for 24 hours.    

199
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,587
during the compression phase, 

200
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,724
excess rubber oozed out and stuck to the pucks,    

201
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,660
so workers run each and every puck manually  

202
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,529
through a trimming machine.  

203
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,265
there is excess rubber stuck to the molds, as well.  

204
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,668
the factory scrapes it off, grinds it up,         

205
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,938
and uses it as filler in subsequent batches.     

206
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:47,611
the mold embedded a dimple pattern on the puck's edge.  

207
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,413
this texture creates friction 

208
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,749
between the puck and hockey stick.       

209
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,218
the more friction, the better stickhandling    

210
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,255
and the greater control the players have.       

211
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,968
narrator: high-pressure cylinders    

212
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,438
are metal containers designed for storing gases   

213
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,706
and for dispensing them at high pressure.       

214
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,909
think fire extinguishers and oxygen tanks.       

215
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,510
the contents are often flammable,      

216
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,844
so the challenge        

217
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,848
is how to make these often lifesaving cylinders safe    

218
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,484
yet still easy enough to use.            

219
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,461
these cylinders are made out of chromoly,   

220
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,864
a steel alloy containing chromium and molybdenum.    

221
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,933
they start with disks that have already been heat-treated 

222
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,604
at 1,300 degrees fahrenheit for 36 hours.         

223
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,074
now they go into the first of five hot chemical baths   

224
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,043
that will help the metal flex. 

225
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:02,086
after a quick drying period, each disk moves over a die.   

226
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,888
this process is known as deep drawing    

227
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,026
because a series of machines  
will gradually draw out the disk

228
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,561
to the shape of a cylinder.  

229
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,030
a mandrel press begins stretching the metal,  

230
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,099
applying up to 800 tons of force --          

231
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,036
the weight of two fully loaded jumbo jets.

232
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,773
shaping the cylinder from just one piece of metal  

233
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,444
means it will be seamless,   
and that's a key safety feature.

234
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,246
after the disk comes through, 

235
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,248
steel jaws clamp down on the mandrel,        

236
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,550
and the cylinder slips off.  

237
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,522
now another press stretches it even more.    

238
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,860
this machine applies 250 tons of force   

239
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,130
to continue forming the walls of the cylinder.   

240
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,466
that liquid is a coolant to prevent overheating.     

241
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,870
the cylinder goes through as many as three presses,   

242
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,406
each one stretching it another 60%.   

243
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:01,612
this press forms the closed  
bottom end into a concave shape.

244
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,348
that reinforces the base, helping the cylinder      

245
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,950
withstand up to a thousand times
more pressure         

246
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,420
than a can of cooking spray.  

247
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:18,496
a band saw now slices up to 4 inches off the other end,  

248
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,232
which will become the top of the cylinder.        

249
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:27,771
next, a torch heats that end to 1,800 degrees fahrenheit   

250
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,640
for 90 seconds.        

251
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,909
in a process called hot spinning,      

252
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,978
a worker then places the cylinder in a device    

253
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,781
that spins it at 1,000 rpm.  

254
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,850
as a torch maintains the temperature,        

255
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,587
the machine shapes the edge of the searing-hot metal    

256
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,822
into a curve.         

257
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,461
in this way, the machine    
gradually closes off the top end

258
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:54,532
and shapes two rounded areas called the shoulder and neck. 

259
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,267
making these areas curved   

260
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,604
is the best way to contain pressurized gases. 

261
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,273
curves spread out the stress on the metal.         

262
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,342
a sharp corner would focus the stress in one spot.    

263
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,913
the only exit for gases will be
through a valve at the top.  

264
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,959
workers then place 18 cylinders

265
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,097
in a furnace heated to more than
1,600 degrees fahrenheit.   

266
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,301
after 90 minutes, a machine then
dunks them in a chemical bath 

267
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,902
to cool for six minutes.    

268
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,906
the cylinders are then reheated
to 1,200 degrees fahrenheit  

269
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,508
for 90 minutes,        
then left to cool for two hours.

270
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,911
these transitions between hot and cold --    

271
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,580
a process called tempering -- 

272
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:46,650
strengthen the metal and make it somewhat flexible. 

273
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,520
a cutting tool carves open the 
neck and cuts threads inside it.

274
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,392
this provides the best seal when
the valve screws into the neck. 

275
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,860
workers clean the cylinder's surface  

276
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,063
using a process called shotblasting.      

277
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,466
a machine shoots these tiny steel pellets at the cylinders 

278
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,535
at very high speed.      

279
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,343
they test the cylinder by filling it with water.   

280
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,814
then they seal it off and immerse it in water.    

281
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,152
the machine then adds more water
to the cylinder        

282
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,690
and gauges how well it withstands the extra pressure. 

283
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,425
they rinse the inside with hot water,        

284
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,229
then dry and clean it     
by blowing in some purified air.

285
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,833
next, a hydraulic press indents
the shoulder of the cylinder  

286
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,702
with legally required markings,

287
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,905
such as the manufacturing date and the serial number.     

288
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,044
a machine then stretches a steel collar over the neck. 

289
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,584
another device, called a valver,
tightly screws on the valve,  

290
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,253
creating a leakproof seal.   

291
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,122
after a trip to the paint shop,

292
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,392
these high-pressure cylinders are ready to be filled     

293
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,928
and keep it all under control.
