captions paid for by discovery communications, inc. 

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,225
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,961
individual transporters...   

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,799
...cedar canoes...       

6
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,938
...and electric guitars.    

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,254
it's the world's first self-balancing,     

8
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,856
electrically powered personal transportation device.

9
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,392
built-in sensors and an onboard computer    

10
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,329
keep this $6,000 vehicle upright
as it zooms around,      

11
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,932
up to three times faster than walking speed.      

12
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,634
perfect for large warehouses, delivery routes,        

13
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,071
or anyone who just wants a lift.

14
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,675
tough, lightweight construction materials     

15
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,277
enable the transporter     

16
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,346
to safely take you almost anywhere        

17
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,615
you'd otherwise walk or run.  

18
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,752
this aluminum chassis will house
the vehicle's electronics.   

19
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,620
it can withstand an impact force

20
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,423
equivalent to the weight of three large cars.      

21
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,360
using a press, a worker attaches
couplings to two motors.    

22
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:39,231
these couplings will connect the
motors to gearboxes later on. 

23
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,032
for safety reasons,      

24
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,969
many of the transporter's components are doubled.    

25
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,638
normally, they'll share tasks equally,  

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,709
but any of the twin parts can do
all the work if the other fails.

27
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,113
it's what the industry calls redundancy.          

28
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,514
using three screws on each side,

29
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,084
she installs the motors into the chassis.       

30
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,189
the worker then installs two controller boards     

31
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,057
in the top side of the chassis.

32
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,928
microprocessors in these boards
control the motors.      

33
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,933
then she adds what's called the balance-sensor assembly.  

34
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,935
this includes five gyroscopes 

35
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,871
and two components called fluid-tilt sensors.   

36
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,808
these instruments gauge the vehicle's position  

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,343
relative to the ground.    

38
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,411
the controller boards check these instruments    

39
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,013
100 times per second      

40
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,480
and adjust the vehicle     

41
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,683
by rolling the wheels forward or backward          

42
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,418
when the rider leans either way.

43
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,889
next come wire clusters called harnesses.       

44
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,093
they connect the vehicle's batteries to the control shaft.

45
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,629
the chassis cover doubles as a floor plate    

46
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,564
for the rider to stand on.   

47
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,168
when you step on, your weight pushes four rubber buttons.  

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,971
these disrupt an optical beam on the controller board,    

49
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,640
telling the transporter it has a rider.        

50
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,109
the harnesses fit through holes
in the cover,         

51
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,914
which attaches with eight screws.       

52
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,317
next, she connects the harnesses
to a power converter      

53
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,252
in the base of the control shaft.     

54
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,721
the power converter uses household electricity   

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,258
to recharge the batteries.   

56
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,860
inside the gearbox,      

57
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,730
four gears transfer power from the motor and turn the wheels. 

58
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,599
the gears' teeth are cut on an angle      

59
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,402
so they engage gradually and more smoothly.       

60
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:28,073
this keeps the vehicle's noise to a relatively low hum.    

61
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,743
the worker tightly secures the gearboxes         

62
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,811
to the chassis with a mallet. 

63
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,347
then she opens a waterproof rubber seal    

64
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,817
and plugs in the machine's power cord.          

65
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,423
she tests the electrical system
to ensure that it's grounded  

66
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:48,893
and that there's no short circuit.         

67
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,430
next, she uses five screws   

68
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,566
to attach one of two plastic fenders.  

69
00:03:56,637 --> 00:04:00,705
a tapered metal hub connects each wheel to its gearbox.   

70
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,976
the wheels are about the height
of a small bicycle tire    

71
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,044
but three times wider.     

72
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,186
a molded rubber and metal mat covers the floor plate     

73
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,188
and snaps into place on both fenders.        

74
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,924
after flipping the chassis,  

75
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,993
a worker connects two batteries
to the controller boards.   

76
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,596
when you plug the batteries into a wall socket,      

77
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,932
they recharge in about eight hours.     

78
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,936
the transporter runs as far as 23 miles on a single charge,  

79
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,804
depending on the terrain.   

80
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,540
this machine tests the rider-detect buttons    

81
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,875
by applying pressure in a random pattern.      

82
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,279
the rider and cargo must weigh at least 99 pounds 

83
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,015
but no more than 260 pounds.  

84
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:48,353
the machine also tests the wheels and motors.     

85
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,622
next, the handlebar on the control shaft.     

86
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,759
to steer, you turn the handgrip
left or right.         

87
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,096
the motor responds by spinning 
one wheel faster than the other.

88
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,032
you could also spin the wheels on opposite directions     

89
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,503
to make the vehicle pivot.   

90
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,838
ignition keys with computer chips in them  

91
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,306
restrict traveling speeds   

92
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,777
to either 5 1/2, 10, or 12 1/2 miles per hour.   

93
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,579
the keys also instruct the vehicle to make slow,   

94
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,515
medium, or sharp turns.    

95
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,923
now the fun part -- taking each
transporter for a test-drive. 

96
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,459
the tester listens for unusual sounds       

97
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,194
and checks for vibrations coming from the gearboxes.   

98
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,131
he feels how quickly and reliably the controls respond. 

99
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,867
he runs the transporter up small inclines.       

100
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,737
it's designed to conquer slopes
of up to 20 degrees,      

101
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,807
depending on traction with the ground and the weight on board.

102
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,810
it goes down over a sidewalk curb just as easily.      

103
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,012
only after this thorough test-drive      

104
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,382
is the transporter ready for its first real trip.    

105
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,193
narrator: canoes are truly vessels of history,      

106
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,695
dating back as far as 10,000 years.    

107
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,831
native north americans made them
with frames of wooden ribs   

108
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
covered with bark.       

109
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,902
they used these boats to fish, travel, and trade.       

110
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,604
today's canoes blend traditional construction 

111
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,240
with some high-tech materials 

112
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,309
for even greater durability.  

113
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,980
most of this boat's made of white cedar,      

114
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,849
which is lightweight and weatherproof.       

115
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,316
but for reinforcement,     

116
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,853
the rim and leading edges   
are made of ash, a heavier wood.

117
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,455
construction starts      

118
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,591
with an upside-down template of the canoe          

119
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,726
that's 15 1/2 feet long.    

120
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,330
a worker clamps two long strips
of ash, called gunwales,    

121
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,399
to create the canoe's inner rim,

122
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,735
then adds similar strips curbing
along the two extremities.   

123
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,871
he'll attach the rest of the skeleton to this rim.  

124
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,941
workers soften what will be the boat's cedar ribs     

125
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,477
in nearly boiling water for 45 minutes.        

126
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,415
the ribs are 2 inches wide and almost a half-inch thick. 

127
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,284
the hot water makes them relatively pliable.      

128
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,220
using a hammer for leverage,  

129
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,023
they simply bend the ribs over the template.       

130
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,427
steel guiding strips ensure the 
ribs are 1 3/4 of an inch apart.

131
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,229
with a pneumatic staple gun,  

132
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,965
workers fire two stainless-steel staples  

133
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,902
through each end of the ribs and into the gunwales.     

134
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,437
cement blocks weigh down some of the 43 ribs      

135
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,507
that workers secure over the entire canoe.     

136
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,778
at this point, the ribs measure
between 3 and 5 feet long,   

137
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,447
depending on the area they're covering.       

138
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,919
the workers will later trim the ends to align them.    

139
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,388
next, workers mark the center line        

140
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,856
along the bottom of the boat with a chalk line.       

141
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,259
this is where they'll put the first cedar plank     

142
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,495
to create the skin of the boat.

143
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,734
they lay 18 rows of planks on the boat          

144
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:53,338
and use a box cutter to shape the ends into a curve.

145
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,007
they secure the planks with brass tacks.       

146
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,075
brass because it's rust-resistant      

147
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,414
and its color blends well with the blond wood.      

148
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,216
since the planks are straight-angled,      

149
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,418
this process leaves some wedge-like spaces     

150
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,886
they'll cover separately.   

151
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,557
they cut thin wedges of wood to cover the remaining spaces. 

152
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,159
it takes 8 hours and 2,500 tacks

153
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,696
to fit all the planks on the boat.          

154
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:22,366
in total, it takes one person 30 hours to make one canoe.  

155
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,101
using a circular saw,     

156
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,438
a worker trims the excess from the ends of the ribs.   

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,108
then two workers lift the boat off the template,       

158
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,576
flip it right-side up,     

159
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:36,314
and set it down to rest on two sawhorses.       

160
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,783
here, a worker feels inside the boat        

161
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,719
for any protruding tacks.   

162
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,521
he uses a hammer and metal block
to flatten them.        

163
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,523
most were deflected earlier  

164
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,661
when they hit the metal guide strips on the template. 

165
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,997
a worker tightens a nylon string
between the gunwales,     

166
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,667
bringing the boats extremities together in points.      

167
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,136
he joins the tips of the gunwales with a screw   

168
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,737
at both ends of the boat.   

169
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,674
then he installs triangular pieces of mahogany.      

170
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,577
this hardwood stands out visually when stained     

171
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,480
and also reinforces the ends of the boat.     

172
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:12,617
workers then trim and close off the ends.    

173
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,221
next, they attach two more gunwales with 44 screws    

174
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,958
to create the outer rim of the boat.          

175
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,161
to protect the wood      
and make its surface watertight,

176
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,765
workers cover the bottom of  
the canoe with fiberglass cloth.

177
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:30,035
then they seal it with three coats of clear epoxy resin,   

178
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:35,707
which will need up to two hours
of drying time between coats. 

179
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,376
workers reinforce the front and back of the boat 

180
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,179
with more fiberglass and more resin.        

181
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,515
they do this because these areas
will hit rocks in the shore  

182
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,518
more often than other parts.  

183
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,587
a worker fills holes he drilled
through the bottom of the boat 

184
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,855
with silicone.         

185
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,591
this helps attach the keel, the spine of the boat,     

186
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,128
as well as two long brass components on top of the keel. 

187
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,265
workers complete this step by flipping the canoe     

188
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,001
and attaching 37 screws through the silicone      

189
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,869
and into the keel.       

190
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,676
after thawing frozen strips of rawhide leather in water,  

191
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,945
a worker cuts holes in them.  

192
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,814
these holes enable her to weave the strips together  

193
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,018
to cover the canoe's two ash-wood seats.       

194
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,753
it takes her about an hour   

195
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,155
to weave the required 65 feet of rawhide.          

196
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,424
the pattern is similar to what you see        

197
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,760
on traditional snowshoes.   

198
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,362
it takes two days       

199
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,231
for the leather strips to dry out and tighten.    

200
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,767
workers then protect and strengthen them       

201
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,836
with marine varnish.      

202
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,304
then they install the seats inside the boat        

203
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,906
with four brass bolts.     

204
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,708
next comes the yoke,      

205
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,044
a bar running across the width of the boat.     

206
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,012
it's designed to fit on your shoulders       

207
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,181
when you carry the boat upside down.          

208
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,517
the other bar is for securing gear safely  

209
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,986
while you're out paddling on the water.         

210
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,022
bon voyage.          

211
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,798
narrator: the electric guitar dates back to the 1920s.    

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,532
the original idea was to amplify

213
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,669
the sound of the acoustic guitar.    

214
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,671
the first commercially successful model        

215
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,338
came out in 1932.       

216
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,006
by the 1950s, though,     

217
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,143
the instrument underwent a radical change,       

218
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,146
its body evolving from the traditional hollow shape  

219
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,914
to a thin, solid block of wood.

220
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,153
guitar bodies are usually made of mahogany, poplar,   

221
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,887
or certain maple species --  

222
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,023
lightweight woods that are flexible enough    

223
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,492
to produce the right balance of treble, midrange,      

224
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,293
and bass vibrations.      

225
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,764
workers first saw a plank of wood into specific widths. 

226
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,901
they plane the pieces to a specific thickness,    

227
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,436
usually in the range of 2 to 4 inches.       

228
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,705
then they mark them with the same number      

229
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,774
so they'll end up in the same guitar.      

230
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,709
mixing pieces from different planks     

231
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,778
would combine different wood densities    

232
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,247
and make the body vibrate unevenly.       

233
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,182
damp wood tends to warp,    

234
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,719
so the pieces have to go into a heated room       

235
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,389
until their moisture content drops to less than 6%.     

236
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,391
this takes about two months.  

237
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,260
once the wood dries out,    

238
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,729
workers glue and clamp the pieces together,      

239
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,266
setting them in a vise for three
hours until the glue dries.  

240
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,068
the water-based glue re-wets part of the wood,   

241
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,938
so the block has to go back into the drying room      

242
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,174
for another two months.    

243
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,948
when it comes out, it goes onto a holding device. 

244
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,152
then a computer-guided cutting machine        

245
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,887
uses eight different heads, one after another,       

246
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,224
to gradually carve the body shape.        

247
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,425
this is a semi-acoustic model, 

248
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,262
so the body has some hollowed-out areas.    

249
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,834
after a fine sanding to smooth the surface,     

250
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,903
they trim the contour at a 45-degree angle      

251
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,106
using a small stainless-steel blade.     

252
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,041
then they sand again.     

253
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:00,377
by this point, they've also inserted round metal fixtures 

254
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,248
to hold the bolts that will attach the body and neck.   

255
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,384
to construct the neck,     

256
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,587
they slice a piece of mahogany or hard-rock maple in two   

257
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,956
using a diamond-edged saw for a perfect cut.       

258
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,265
then they glue a .05-inch-thick
sheet of maple veneer     

259
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,334
onto one piece.        

260
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,604
this will be the front surface of the neck.          

261
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:30,074
now they flip the piece over and glue it to the other one. 

262
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,142
flipping inverts the wood grain.

263
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,811
this strengthens the neck,   

264
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,014
enabling it to withstand the tension of the guitar strings. 

265
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,618
the maple veneer hides and reinforces the joint.   

266
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,554
they clamp the components in a vise for three hours   

267
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,491
until the glue sets.      

268
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,560
a computer-guided cutting machine contours the neck shape

269
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,162
and cuts a groove down the middle        

270
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,032
for a steel bar called the truss rod.     

271
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,368
when the neck bows from tension
created by heavy-gauge strings,

272
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,837
you straighten it       

273
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,240
by adjusting the protruding end
of the truss rod.       

274
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,841
next, the fingerboard --    

275
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,711
the surface against which you press the strings     

276
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,713
to produce different notes and chords.          

277
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,049
it's made of maple, ebony, or rosewood.          

278
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,985
after gluing the fingerboard over the truss rod,      

279
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,588
they place the neck into a vacuum press.      

280
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,791
the press sucks out all the air,

281
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,994
compressing the components into one solid unit.      

282
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,131
once the glue dries,      

283
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,001
the neck goes onto a      
computer-guided carving machine.

284
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,705
its 12 different cutting heads finalize the shape.      

285
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,011
next, a 22-blade saw      

286
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:44,082
simultaneously cuts very precise
slots for 22 fret wires,    

287
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,352
the metal lines on the fingerboard.      

288
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,097
a worker rounds off and smoothes
the back of the neck      

289
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,966
against a belt sander...    

290
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,037
...then installs the fret wires.

291
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,507
the wires are made of nickel and lead.  

292
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,776
they have teeth on the bottom that grab the wood.      

293
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,644
that's why it's essential   

294
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,748
that the slots be a very precise
width and depth.        

295
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,053
finally, they run the sides of the neck     

296
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,656
against the sanding belt.   

297
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:27,258
this trims off the excess fret wire      

298
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,262
and rounds off the edges of the fingerboard.      

299
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,265
back to the body now.     

300
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,734
a worker puts it in a silk-screen printer    

301
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,602
to apply the company name.   

302
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,573
the ink dries in just seconds under ultraviolet light.    

303
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,947
after applying a sealant to block the wood's pores,   

304
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,951
they spray on up to 22 coats of wood stain and lacquer.   

305
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,087
this protects the wood     

306
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,557
and gives it a semi- or high-gloss finish. 

307
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,969
narrator: now onto the mechanics.    

308
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,105
an electric guitar works like this.           

309
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,708
a magnet-and-coil assembly called a pickup        

310
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,910
works like a mini-microphone. 

311
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,579
it picks up the sound vibrations
of the strings         

312
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,247
and sends them to an amplifier 

313
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,982
which sends them to a speaker 

314
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,052
which emits that trademark electric-guitar sound.     

315
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,392
before installing the electronic
components, though,      

316
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,926
a few final steps.       

317
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,862
after a 6-week curing period, 

318
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,798
they wet-sand the painted and lacquered wood,      

319
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,801
then buff until the surface is so glossy          

320
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,537
it produces a mirror finish.  

321
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,540
then they polish it with wax. 

322
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:53,077
if the frets aren't level, the guitar will buzz,     

323
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,147
so workers color the top of each fret with a marker,  

324
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,282
then run a sheet of fine sandpaper       

325
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,884
down the fingerboard.     

326
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,754
the ink rubs off on any frets that are higher than the rest 

327
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,089
and have to be filed down.   

328
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,225
the filings flatten the fret's edges,       

329
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:11,095
so workers round them off using a special curved file.  

330
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,098
then, with very fine sandpaper,

331
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,501
they buff away the filing marks.

332
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,103
they clean the fingerboard with mineral oil.       

333
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:23,975
this also nourishes the rosewood
so it won't dry out and crack. 

334
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,844
now they turn an allen key in the truss rod        

335
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,378
to straighten out the neck.  

336
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,049
this gauge measures the curve. 

337
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,584
when the needle hits zero,   

338
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,987
the neck is perfectly straight.

339
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,057
now the six tuning keys --   

340
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,858
one for each string.      

341
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,726
depending on the model,    

342
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,663
these steel keys are plated with either gold or nickel   

343
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,265
or painted black.       

344
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:48,999
you turn the black acrylic peg 

345
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,136
to tighten or loosen the string
for tuning.          

346
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,871
workers use a digital gauge  

347
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,940
to measure the height of the nut --         

348
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,342
a thin piece of either bone or very hard plastic      

349
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,545
with six slots to space the strings.     

350
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,148
if it isn't in precisely the right position,      

351
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,017
tuning will be off and the strings will buzz.   

352
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,154
now the neck is ready to join the body,       

353
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,691
courtesy of four bolts driven 
from the back of the instrument.

354
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,093
they fit into those round metal fixtures   

355
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,362
we saw in the previous segment.

356
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,165
and now the electronic components.   

357
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,634
workers begin by soldering control knobs   

358
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,303
for the volume and tone    

359
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,838
to the pickup selector switch --

360
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
the switch that activates any of the pickups --     

361
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,043
sets of magnets with wire coiled around them.      

362
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,911
like miniature microphones,  

363
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,046
they pick up the sound vibrations      

364
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,848
entering their magnetic field, 

365
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,317
transform them into electronic signals,    

366
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,854
which then go out to the amplifier and speaker. 

367
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,257
one pickup will be just above the bridge --    

368
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,127
a brass piece that anchors the other end of the strings. 

369
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,264
the pickup has one magnet and wire coil for each string. 

370
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,868
standard electric guitars don't
have a pickup at the bridge,  

371
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,602
but this model has one     

372
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,273
to enable the instrument to also
sound like an acoustic guitar. 

373
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:06,010
you can even use the electric and acoustic sounds together. 

374
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,350
workers drill holes in the body
for installing the bridge,   

375
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,919
using a template as a guide.  

376
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,826
they attach the bridge with screws...         

377
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,233
...then install the bridge pickup just above it      

378
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:32,703
and the body and neck pickups above that.          

379
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,305
then they flip it over     

380
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,440
and hook up what's called the tremolo,          

381
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,576
a lever-activated set of steel springs        

382
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,378
that temporarily loosen the guitar strings.      

383
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,782
the musician uses the tremolo on select notes and chords   

384
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,851
to create a quivering effect --

385
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,520
that distinctive electric-guitar sound.     

386
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,789
the volume and tone knobs come next,           

387
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,858
tucked into a cavity in the back,          

388
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,194
then secured to the front with a nut.          

389
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,665
now the pickup selector switch.

390
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:05,402
it also comes through the back to the front of the instrument.

391
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,138
then they add the last electronic component --    

392
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,142
a jack for the cable going to the amplifier.    

393
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,213
they plug in the cable,    

394
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,248
and flicking the selector switch,      

395
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,451
do a tap test on each pick up. 

396
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,426
now it's time to string the guitar.     

397
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,962
they pull the steel strings from the back         

398
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,499
through the bridge in the front,

399
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,102
then wind them onto the tuning keys      

400
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,339
using a drill with a special adaptor.    

401
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,711
then it's into a soundproof booth       

402
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:51,582
to tune the guitar with the help
of a digital tuner.      

403
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,819
and then it's played for the first time.       

404
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,062
[ playing scales ]
