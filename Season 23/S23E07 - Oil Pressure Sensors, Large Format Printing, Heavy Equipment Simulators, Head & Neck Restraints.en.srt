    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,253
  narrator: in motor vehicles,  
     an oil pressure sensor     

4
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:58,924
       is a critical part       
         of the engine.         

5
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:02,795
       as oil lubricates,       
   cools and cleans the motor,  

6
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:05,598
     this sensor constantly     
      measures the pressure     

7
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,467
  and signals a problem before  
    it causes serious damage    

8
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,236
         to the engine.         

9
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,678
   screwed to the engine block  

10
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:21,614
          and connected         
     to the car's computer,     

11
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:22,882
      the sensor can detect     

12
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:26,552
       the smallest change      
        in oil pressure.        

13
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,554
       the computer relays      
         the information        

14
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,556
 to the gauge on the dashboard. 

15
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,692
  it allows the driver to tell  
           at a glance          

16
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:35,494
  if there's a pressure problem 
         under the hood.        

17
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,500
         to manufacture         
       motor oil sensors,       

18
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,303
        a robot picks up        
   a perforated ceramic board   

19
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:47,706
 and transfers it to a carriage.

20
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:52,177
 the carriage shuttles the board
 into a screen printing machine.

21
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,381
          it squeegees          
 palladium silver paste onto it,

22
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:59,185
 creating a pattern for a sensor
    around each of the holes.   

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,989
      the silver will serve     
   as an electrical conductor.  

24
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,124
   a trip through a long oven   
     bakes the silver paste     

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,261
        onto the ceramic.       

26
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,564
        then it's back to       
  the screen printing machine.  

27
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:18,270
 this time, the squeegee applies
       a green glass glaze      

28
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,172
        onto the silver.        

29
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,277
     the pattern leaves some    
      of the silver exposed     

30
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,279
for the attachment of components

31
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,483
   like capacitors and diodes.  

32
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,685
      a robot then applies      
        those components        

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,687
       faster than you can      
          blink an eye.         

34
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,293
    the next robot transfers    
    terminals to the sensors.   

35
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,166
       to align the prongs      
         of the terminal        

36
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,367
       with exposed silver      
         on the sensor,         

37
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:52,838
    the robot takes a picture   
  and sends it to the computer. 

38
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,575
    the computer then guides    
        the positioning.        

39
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,078
   it all happens in a flash.   

40
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,587
   once the terminal has been   
     soldered to the sensor,    

41
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:12,391
     another robot dispenses    
 adhesive around the components.

42
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,929
    this seals the circuitry    
          from the oil          

43
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,266
         that will flow         
    through the center hole.    

44
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:24,269
      the next robot places     
  a silicon chip on the sensor, 

45
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,473
      covering and sealing      
        the center hole.        

46
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:30,910
      this chip will react      
   to changes in oil pressure.  

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,617
       another robot bonds      
        the silicon chip        

48
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,619
        to the circuitry        
       using aluminum wire      

49
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,688
         that's thinner         
       than a human hair.       

50
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,658
         this completes         
   the electrical connection.   

51
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,497
an employee now inserts the ends
   of the sensors in a fixture  

52
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,167
         and breaks them        
       along score lines.       

53
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:58,637
       this separates them      
      into strips of five.      

54
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,039
     she transfers the strip    
          to a machine          

55
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,110
    that bends the terminals    
       to a precise shape.      

56
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:10,649
   she snaps the ceramic along  
        more score lines        

57
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:14,687
 to separate the strips of five 
      into single sensors.      

58
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,128
next, she connects the terminals
  to posts in plastic housing.  

59
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,997
 after soldering them in place, 

60
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:31,003
       she folds the rest       
    of the sensor over them.    

61
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:35,007
  she then places brass shells  
          in a carrier.         

62
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,876
 she inserts two rubber o rings 
        in the shells --        

63
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:43,015
  a large one and a smaller one 
     around the center hole.    

64
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:46,551
  the robots take it from here. 

65
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,553
     the first one picks up     
      the sensor assembly,      

66
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:54,827
 and using a camera as a guide, 
transfers it to the brass shell.

67
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,831
        then it's over to       
   a press and crimp station.   

68
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,367
  the top tool applies pressure 
     to compress the o rings    

69
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,838
as forming tools crimp the shell
       around the sensor.       

70
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:14,579
 an applicator coats the threads
of the brass shell with sealant.

71
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,583
   when dry, this sealant will  
    enhance the sensor's fit    

72
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,820
          to the engine         
     to prevent oil leakage.    

73
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,126
 a test hit probes each sensor, 

74
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:31,330
           performing           
  a full electrical evaluation. 

75
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,999
  it also applies air pressure  
       to test for leaks.       

76
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:43,309
     after passing the test,    
   the oil sensor is complete.  

77
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,830
  narrator: businesses looking  
          to advertise          

78
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,765
      will often commission     
       a printing company       

79
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:10,236
           to produce           
    a large poster or banner.   

80
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,906
         the quality of         
      large format printing     

81
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:18,644
       is better than ever      
  thanks to digital technology. 

82
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,059
      commercial equipment      
  can typically print a banner  

83
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,129
       up to 16 feet high       
        by 150 feet wide.       

84
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:41,467
 if the required size is larger,
    it's printed in sections,   

85
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,268
      then joined together.     

86
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,804
      a prepress technician     
    preps the clients' design   

87
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,539
         for printing --        

88
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,343
  adjusting colors, sectioning, 
       and adding a bleed.      

89
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,079
     this is a blind border     
        around the design       

90
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,683
because the machines can't print
    all the way to the edge.    

91
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,353
     then it's time to load     
 a roll-to-roll printing machine

92
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,822
     with weather resistant     
           vinyl mesh.          

93
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,828
   they feed the leading edge   
  of the roll into the machine  

94
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,497
       and pull it through      
         the output end.        

95
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,633
      this aligns the vinyl     
      so that the printing      

96
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,368
     won't come out crooked.    

97
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,304
   they slip a cardboard tube   
         over the roller        

98
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,206
       which will receive       
        the printed vinyl       

99
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,243
  and tape on the leading edge. 

100
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,712
  if this job required printing 
      on a ridged material,     

101
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,914
         they'd be using        
        a flatbed printer       

102
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,982
  rather than the roll-to-roll. 

103
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:35,988
       both machines print      
    with ink-jet technology,    

104
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,191
           similar to           
    a home computer printer.    

105
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,062
   however, rather than using   
         dye-based inks,        

106
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:45,431
they're typically solvent-based.

107
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,069
  they're designed to withstand 
       outdoor conditions       

108
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,737
    for three to five years.    

109
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,340
        the machine uses        
 the standard ink-jet colors -- 

110
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,078
      black, yellow, cyan,      
          and magenta.          

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,014
   it also includes light cyan  
        and light magenta       

112
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,850
      to provide additional     
        shade variations.       

113
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,423
 the machine has 12 print heads,
          2 per color.          

114
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,693
   each head has 256 nozzles.   

115
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,763
 once daily, they're put through
    a full cleaning procedure   

116
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,433
      to prevent clogging.      

117
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:24,770
      the print head moves      
back and forth across the vinyl.

118
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,039
       the computer guides      
     the individual nozzles     

119
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,642
     to deposit dots of ink     
       at specific spots.       

120
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:34,847
 all those colored dots together
    form the printed design.    

121
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,918
 the first 6 inches the machine 
   prints are a color bar test  

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,122
 to make sure that every nozzle 
      is working properly.      

123
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,526
         the printing of        
   the actual design follows.   

124
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,597
    the printed vinyl banner    
        exits the machine       

125
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,233
        and winds around        
      the receiving roller.     

126
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,538
    then they mount the roll    
      onto another machine,     

127
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,208
   which trims off the excess   
       vinyl and the bleed      

128
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:07,946
       with rotary blades.      

129
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,482
 when the banner is compromised 
          of sections,          

130
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,217
      workers connect them.     

131
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,353
   first they align the edges,  

132
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:17,723
    then they bond the joint    
 temporarily with masking tape. 

133
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:33,372
       they flick a switch      
     to project laser lines,    

134
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,575
    which indicate the width    
     and center of the weld.    

135
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,777
    the weld will permanently   
      connect the sections      

136
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,312
      on the reverse side.      

137
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,514
  turning the banner facedown,  

138
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,050
     workers align the joint    
      with the center line.     

139
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,121
    a magnetic strip secures    
     the banner to the table    

140
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,855
  to prevent it from shifting,  

141
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,259
       and a vacuum pulls       
        the banner taut.        

142
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,529
        at the same time,       
a hot air welder fuses the joint

143
00:09:57,565 --> 00:10:01,600
       with heat-activated      
         adhesive tape.         

144
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,402
    then they flip the banner   
          faceup again          

145
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,537
 and remove the temporary tape. 

146
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,948
  the last step is to reinforce 
  the perimeter with webbing -- 

147
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,484
        the material used       
         for seat belts.        

148
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,353
      this gives the banner     
      a nice finished edge.     

149
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,823
 it also creates a strong border

150
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,094
   in which to secure grommets  
     for hanging the banner.    

151
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:34,299
   workers apply the grommets   
manually with a pneumatic press.

152
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,504
a banner typically has a grommet
        every 24 inches,        

153
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,707
     plus 3 in each corner.     

154
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:42,974
       to hang the banner,      

155
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,243
      you run bungee cords      
      through the grommets,     

156
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,046
  pull taut, then hook the ends 
        to plates affixed       

157
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,382
     to the building facade.    

158
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:54,052
 a few screws for reinforcement,
        and you're done.        

159
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,589
    wind passes right through   
the tiny holes of the vinyl mesh

160
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,092
  so the banner doesn't billow. 

161
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,675
 narrator: when you're learning 
 how to operate heavy equipment,

162
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,079
 one wrong move can cause damage
          or injuries.          

163
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,816
  that's why it's becoming more 
 common to train on a simulator,

164
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:27,752
       which can replicate      
       real-life scenarios      

165
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,790
     from typical maneuvers     
    to emergency situations.    

166
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,496
   whether learning to operate  
 a crane, backhoe, or excavator,

167
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:41,433
    it's safer for a trainee    
     to make rookie mistakes    

168
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,903
     at a virtual work site.    

169
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,172
 the instructor simply installs 
    heavy equipment controls    

170
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,843
            and loads           
    the appropriate software.   

171
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,246
       then the simulator       
     is all set to replicate    

172
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:58,116
  how the equipment maneuvers.  

173
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,252
   a heavy equipment simulator  
           begins life          

174
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:03,788
         as a series of         
     3-d technical drawings.    

175
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,425
     mechanical engineering     
 technicians plug in the details

176
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,994
    of the customer's order,    

177
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,196
      including foot pedals     
          and joysticks         

178
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,399
   to control the equipment's   
       various movements.       

179
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,668
    then assembly can begin.    

180
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,403
      following the plans,      

181
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,072
        technicians build       
    the steel motion platform   

182
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,408
  which replicates the movement 
           of the cab.          

183
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,544
       its base has wheels      
    for rolling the simulator   

184
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:29,881
  from one location to another. 

185
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,483
       this drive controls      
       the three actuators      

186
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:35,020
       which raise, lower,      
     and tilt the platform.     

187
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,629
    once the technicians have   
     installed and wired up     

188
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:48,634
      all three actuators,      
they install the platform cover.

189
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,574
        next, they mount        
   the height-adjustable seat.  

190
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:59,044
          at its base,          
      enclosed in a bellow,     

191
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,713
    is a pneumatic suspension   
             system.            

192
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,782
      this enables the seat     
 to realistically bounce or jerk

193
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,786
    in response to the action   
        being simulated.        

194
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,722
           meanwhile,           
  another technician assembles  

195
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,124
  the simulator's control box.  

196
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,860
            he mounts           
     the joystick controller    

197
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,863
     and connects its wiring    
       to a cable inside.       

198
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,570
 the cable leads to a connector 
     on the base of the box.    

199
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,541
that connector simply plugs into
       the motion platform      

200
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,078
           right next           
     to the operator's seat.    

201
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:36,548
    the box attaches securely   
     with large screw knobs,    

202
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,617
  making it easy to disconnect  

203
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,453
  and switch to different kinds 
         of simulations.        

204
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:49,894
   the foot pedals are mounted  
     to a separate platform.    

205
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,163
      technicians attach it     
     to the motion platform     

206
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,299
        with two screws.        

207
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,834
      like the control box,     

208
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:59,304
the idea is to be able to switch
   this pedal platform easily   

209
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,706
      for a different one.      

210
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,443
       the simulator's cab      
     is now fully assembled     

211
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,279
     and it moves just like     
           a real one.          

212
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,655
 the virtual view from the cab, 
    spans five l.c.d. screens   

213
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:20,726
 to give the trainee a realistic
  perspective of the work site. 

214
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,799
        after installing        
      the screen supports,      

215
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,968
   workers mount the screens.   

216
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,675
    the configuration mimics    
        the window layout       

217
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,410
       of the typical cab.      

218
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,617
 the simulation runs on software
    that's designed in-house.   

219
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,953
 however, the client can further
      customize the program     

220
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,956
  for a specific make and model 
       of heavy equipment       

221
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,494
     or to simulate specific    
   scenarios that might arise   

222
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,696
   on a particular work site.   

223
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,631
        the simulator has       
    five different computers.   

224
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,435
        three of them run       
 the seat movement, the screens,

225
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,504
    and a small touch screen    
     to the trainee's right.    

226
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,573
      that screen displays      
       the buttons, knobs,      

227
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,177
          and levers of         
the heavy equipment's dashboard.

228
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,912
 the fourth computer calculates 

229
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,182
           the physics          
  of the simulated environment  

230
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,317
     such as the excavator's    
        digging movement        

231
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,953
      and the corresponding     
         soil movement.         

232
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,858
   the fifth computer manages   
     the training scenarios.    

233
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,193
          for instance,         

234
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,394
    an instructor can program   
   adverse weather conditions   

235
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:35,600
      to make the exercise      
         more difficult.        

236
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:38,069
  to simulate a different piece 
          of equipment,         

237
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,006
 the instructor simply switches 
     the joystick and pedals    

238
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,740
          if necessary          

239
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,110
            and loads           
    the appropriate software.   

240
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:51,015
  in the simulator, the trainee 
    has the same perspective    

241
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:55,353
      he or she would have      
      in the real-life cab.     

242
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,756
    three reflective markers    
          on the helmet         

243
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,092
    enable an infrared camera   
    mounted above the screens   

244
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,094
     to track the trainee's     
         head movements.        

245
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,497
    this prompts the software   

246
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,699
           to display           
     the corresponding view.    

247
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,183
            narrator:           
    tragedy on the racetrack    

248
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,919
     led to the development     
 of the head and neck restraint 

249
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,121
          in the 1980s.         

250
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,258
   investigations had revealed  
 a deadly trend in motor sports.

251
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,994
     with the driver's body     
           restrained,          

252
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,662
    the head moved violently    
           in a crash,          

253
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,131
        causing fracture        
    to the base of the skull.   

254
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,934
            clearly,            
   more restraint was needed.   

255
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,740
      attached to a helmet,     
    a head and neck restraint   

256
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,943
       is designed to save      
       the racer's skull.       

257
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,878
     it has become required     
            equipment           

258
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:56,515
  in many racing organizations. 

259
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,817
    to make these restraints,   

260
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,888
        they mix plastic        
    and carbon fiber pellets.   

261
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,490
   the carbon fiber fortifies   
          the plastic,          

262
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,359
          which is made         
      from castor bean oil      

263
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,694
 instead of petroleum products. 

264
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,998
   a machine melts the mixture  

265
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,568
   and injects it into a mold   
         under pressure         

266
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,704
  to produce the base structure 
       for the restraint.       

267
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,841
     the operator breaks off    
  what's known as the sprue --  

268
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,577
    plastic that's solidified   
         in the channels        

269
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,113
      leading to the mold.      

270
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,317
      he trims the plastic      
    and carbon fiber overflow   

271
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,119
     from around the edges.     

272
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,689
     this overflow is known     
   in the industry as "flash."  

273
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:44,930
   he hangs the parts to cure   
     over a 24-hour period.     

274
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,334
   the next day, the employee   
    clamps the part in a jig    

275
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,469
          and activates         
       computerized tools.      

276
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,205
   the first one drills holes   
     for tethering restraint    

277
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,940
         to the helmet.         

278
00:17:55,943 --> 00:18:00,145
        another trims it        
       to its final size.       

279
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,481
     an automated hot knife     
 now cuts nylon tether material 

280
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,717
     to the correct length.     

281
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,822
        then it's over to       
  a computerized sewing machine 

282
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:15,427
      to stitch the tether      
    around a chrome fitting.    

283
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,029
 the stitching pattern has been 
     designed by an engineer    

284
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,398
          to withstand          
      the force of impact.      

285
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,373
   the operator then stitches   
           on a label,          

286
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,375
 which says the tether's design 
       has been sanctioned      

287
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,180
  by both american and european 
      racing organizations.     

288
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,323
        next, using a dye       
    powered by bursts of air,   

289
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,459
      a worker punches out      
          shoulder pads         

290
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,394
       from cushion foam.       

291
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
   the next member of the team  
    slides the shoulder pads    

292
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,136
      into casings made of      
     fire-resistant cotton.     

293
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,473
        it's a snug fit,        

294
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,875
           and without          
  a special installation tool,  

295
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,777
  the job wouldn't go smoothly. 

296
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,482
       by folding the pad       
          into the tool         

297
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,618
      and then inserting it     
       into the long case,      

298
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,754
     there are no bunch ups.    

299
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,160
  some head and neck restraints 
         are adjustable         

300
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,231
       so drivers can find      
     a more comfortable fit.    

301
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,767
 they assemble those restraints 
         in three pieces        

302
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:33,271
  with the adjustable fittings  
         in the joints.         

303
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,573
    the employee then paints    
         adhesive primer        

304
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,910
     onto the base structure    
 of the head and neck restraint.

305
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,851
  he coats most of the plastic  

306
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,919
    and carbon fiber surface    
            with it.            

307
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:53,258
   he applies neoprene padding  
     to the primed surface.     

308
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,696
 the padding is adhesive backed 
     and it bonds instantly.    

309
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,734
     he attaches the tether     
  to the back of the restraint  

310
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,970
 with plastic clips and screws. 

311
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,144
    using hook and loop tape,   

312
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,346
  he secures the shoulder pads  
        to the other side       

313
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,082
    of the restraint's yoke.    

314
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:26,224
     another worker applies     
   more certification labels.   

315
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,425
        they signify that       
      the actual structure      

316
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,262
 of the head and neck restraint 
        meets standards.        

317
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,238
          they now test         
 a randomly selected restraint. 

318
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,439
         a hydraulic arm        
        pulls the tethers       

319
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,575
   until the restraint snaps,   

320
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:48,579
       mimicking the force      
      of a violent impact.      

321
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,382
  the restraint withstands more 
      than what's required      

322
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,052
 and breaks in the right place. 

323
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,123
   next, an employee attaches   
    a head and neck restraint   

324
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,361
to the helmet using the tethers.

325
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,999
        two crash dummies       
 put the restraints to the test.

326
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,068
       the one on the left      
    isn't wearing a restraint   

327
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,338
     while the right one is.    

328
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,141
 steady nerves and a steady head
   could save a racer's life,   

329
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:20,912
  and a head and neck restraint 
  definitely improves the odds.
