1
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:56,455
   narrator: many recipes call  
    for shredded ingredients,   

2
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:00,459
 which is why a cheese grater is
 an indispensable kitchen tool. 

3
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:04,062
depending on which type of blade
     or blades a grater has,    

4
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,799
     you can coarsely shred     
         to finely grate        

5
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,236
    not just cheese but also    
    potatoes and vegetables.    

6
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,145
graters come in different sizes,
   shapes, and configurations,  

7
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,081
 from flat models with one blade

8
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,885
 to box graters with a different
       blade on each side.      

9
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,288
       the blades are made      
  from a stainless-steel sheet  

10
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,691
        that's just 1/50        
        of an inch thick.       

11
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:34,226
        the sheet enters        
       a shearing machine,      

12
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,565
  where a die descends and cuts 
 the blade shape, holes and all.

13
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,505
       the machine's dies       
      are interchangeable,      

14
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,841
        so when it's time       
  to produce a different model, 

15
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:53,045
 workers simply remove this die 
    and install another one.    

16
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,515
       stainless steel is       
    the ideal blade material    

17
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:01,053
    because it's food-safe,     
    durable, and rust-proof.    

18
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:05,257
  for this model, the next step 
     is to curve the blade.     

19
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,128
they insert it into a press that
  bends it with a rounded die.  

20
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,598
    the press also turns over   
  the edges along three sides,  

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,601
 forming a channel for a handle.

22
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:20,873
       the handle is made       
    of stainless-steel wire.    

23
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:25,945
   a bending machine wraps it   
 around a grater-shaped form... 

24
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,084
   ...then cuts the end free,   

25
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,987
      releasing what is now     
       a finished handle.       

26
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:58,377
      now for this model's      
         final assembly.        

27
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,281
     workers slide a handle     
   into the blade's channels.   

28
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,329
     next they put the blade    
           in a press,          

29
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:21,667
   which forces the channels    
   closed, encasing the wire.   

30
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:26,338
    with the handle and blade   
      now locked together,      

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,973
     the grater is finished.    

32
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:35,280
  another model has a built-in  
tray to collect the grated food.

33
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,750
       this machine forms       
       the pivoting handle      

34
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,886
     which enables the blade    
  to stand upright in the tray. 

35
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,556
 first the machine cuts a strip 
       of stainless steel       

36
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,891
     to the required length.    

37
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,628
   it makes holes for a rivet   
          on each side.         

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,999
     then it bends the piece    
         to a "u" shape.        

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,847
   meanwhile, a forming press   

40
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,485
         shapes the tray        
 out of a stainless-steel sheet.

41
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,395
         the tray moves         
       to the next press,       

42
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:26,332
   which slices off the excess  
       from the perimeter.      

43
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,011
         the tray is now        
       completely formed.       

44
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,082
 all that's left to do is punch 
       a hole on each side      

45
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:46,819
 for the rivets that attach the 
 handle that props up the blade.

46
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:57,663
 they take the handle and rivet 
   it to one end of the blade.  

47
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,040
    next, they rivet the tray   
 to the other end of the blade, 

48
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,943
        and the grater is       
        fully assembled.        

49
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,119
      this company packaged     
certain models in blister packs.

50
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:23,989
     workers put the grater     
    in a clear plastic cover,   

51
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,126
     then position a printed    
   cardboard backing over it.   

52
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,595
      the backing is coated     

53
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,063
        with transparent,       
      heat-activated glue.      

54
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,933
a few seconds under a hot press,

55
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,868
      and the plastic cover     
     adheres to the backing,    

56
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,406
    encapsulating the grater.   

57
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,076
   from a basic version on up,  

58
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,678
           a grater is          
    an essential kitchen tool   

59
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,048
  most cooks can't do without.  

60
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,232
     narrator: when it comes    
  to cuisine, some like it hot. 

61
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,236
     a quick way to satisfy     
     a picante-loving palate    

62
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:12,771
     is with a splash or two    
          of hot sauce,         

63
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,107
        typically served        
        with mexican food       

64
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,443
     such as nachos, tacos,     
          and burritos.         

65
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,844
      it can also spice up      
          everyday fare         

66
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,915
     such as eggs, potatoes,    
         and sandwiches.        

67
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,053
 this american company has been 
      producing hot sauce,      

68
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,990
   also called a pepper sauce,  
           since 1868.          

69
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,060
      its signature version     
  is made from tabasco peppers, 

70
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,795
     a type of chile pepper.    

71
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,798
      the brand also comes      
    in additional varieties,    

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,135
    using habanero, chipotle,   
   and green jalapeÑo peppers.  

73
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,339
 the company has pepper fields  
 at its home base in louisiana, 

74
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,808
      as well as in central     
      and in south america,     

75
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,611
      using seeds harvested     
    from the louisiana crop.    

76
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,280
   the company president uses   
       his experienced eye      

77
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,217
    to select the best plants   
     for seed extraction --     

78
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:02,020
       those with even and      
 early-ripening, juicy peppers, 

79
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,622
 well-formed, layered branches, 

80
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,623
and healthy, damage-free leaves.

81
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,960
     he marks his selection     
         with a string.         

82
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,295
      then pickers harvest      
          those peppers         

83
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,631
          and send them         
     to the seed extractor.     

84
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,234
   the peppers are hand-picked  
 for sauce production, as well. 

85
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,104
     to determine which ones    
        are ripe enough,        

86
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,841
   the pickers use what cajuns  
   call a petite baton rouge,   

87
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,044
 french for "little red stick." 

88
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,847
 if a pepper matches the color  
 of the stick, they harvest it. 

89
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,849
 if not, it stays on the plant. 

90
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,924
      it's labor-intensive      

91
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,328
  but ensures only the perfect  
   peppers go into the sauce.   

92
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,865
   within hours of harvesting,  

93
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,669
 the factory grinds the peppers 
    and mixes them with salt.   

94
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,004
       this creates a mash      

95
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:55,874
which then goes into oak whiskey
   barrels to ferment and age.  

96
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,410
     wooden barrels breathe,    

97
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:02,447
   letting in just enough air   
 to spur natural yeast growth --

98
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,950
   the key to fermentation --   
      but not too much air,     

99
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,421
 which would discolor the mash  
 and produce a metallic flavor. 

100
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,291
       after laying paper       
       on top of the mash       

101
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,793
           to prevent           
     surface discoloration,     

102
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,529
    workers seal the barrels.   

103
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,369
then they spread a layer of salt
          over the top.         

104
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,445
       the barrels now go       
       to the warehouse,        

105
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:38,450
     where the mash ferments    
    and ages for three years.   

106
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,919
      fermentation releases     
       carbon-dioxide gas,      

107
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,387
     which forces liquid out    

108
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,123
       through a vent hole      
    in the top of the barrel.   

109
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,461
   the salt absorbs the liquid  
          and hardens.          

110
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,398
      after the three-year      
 fermentation and aging period, 

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,269
     they break up the salt     
      and open the barrel.      

112
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,343
 what was once pungent and acrid

113
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:08,046
        is now aromatic,        
 with a mellow, complex flavor. 

114
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,650
     however, it still needs    
      significant refining.     

115
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,287
         so they pump it        
    into large mixing tanks,    

116
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,691
    add vinegar, then churn     
    for three to four weeks.    

117
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,960
    that's now long it takes    
         for the vinegar        

118
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,230
 to break down the pepper solids
     into smaller particles.    

119
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,434
      during that process,      
    the vinegar also takes on   

120
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:32,638
  the color, flavor, and aroma  
         of the peppers.        

121
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,774
       the sauce requires       
      no cooking whatsoever     

122
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,011
    because the vinegar acts    
   as a natural preservative.   

123
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:46,318
        the next step is        
  a two-stage milling process.  

124
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,523
         the first mill         
    extracts the pepper pulp.   

125
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,392
         the second mill        
       removes the seeds.       

126
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,428
   the sauce is now finished.   

127
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,468
 the quality-control department 
        analyzes samples        

128
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,937
    from every batch of sauce   
         for viscosity,         

129
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,006
         ph, salt level,        
       and other criteria.      

130
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:12,277
  lab technicians also perform  
     taste tests for flavor,    

131
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,412
      clearing their palate     
    in between with crackers    

132
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,016
   and cooling the fiery heat   
      with ice-cream bars.      

133
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,487
       once the batch gets      
         the thumbs-up,         

134
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,756
           it's pumped          
      to the bottling line.     

135
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,292
     the company uses glass     
       rather than plastic      

136
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,695
    because glass is a better   
     barrier against oxygen.    

137
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,365
       oxygen penetration       
     would adversely affect     

138
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,168
      the flavor and color      
          of the sauce.         

139
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,038
  the capping machine twists on 
      a plastic screw cap.      

140
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,241
     then the bottles travel    
         to the labeler,        

141
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,442
          which adheres         
     the main product label,    

142
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,244
slips on a decorative neck band,

143
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:50,415
and applies a clear plastic seal
          over the cap.         

144
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:57,422
   hot off the production line  
        and ready to go.        

145
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,209
   narrator: people have been   
making jewelry and other objects

146
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,544
     since about 4,000 b.c.     

147
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,814
  silver remains popular today  
      because of its beauty     

148
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:26,218
      and its affordability     
 compared to gold and platinum. 

149
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,819
   pure silver is rather soft,  

150
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,889
 so it's traditionally combined 
     with one or more metals    

151
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,392
       to give it hardness      
          and strength.         

152
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,564
 the silver used in jewelry is  
 traditionally sterling silver. 

153
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:45,437
      sterling is composed      
 of 92.5% silver and 7.5% alloy.

154
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,572
   the alloy is usually copper  

155
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,907
       or copper combined       
       with other metals.       

156
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,311
          this mexican          
   jewelry manufacturer melts   

157
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:55,681
  the standard ratio of copper  
  and zinc alloy to silver...   

158
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,050
   ...then also remelts silver  

159
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,720
   left over from the jewelry   
       production process.      

160
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,324
  at 1,760 degrees fahrenheit,  

161
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,659
     it takes just seconds      
     for these solid metals     

162
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,995
        to become molten        
        sterling silver,        

163
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:14,132
 at which point workers pour it 
  into a stainless-steel mold.  

164
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:17,803
    the silver rapidly cools    
  and hardens into a flat bar.  

165
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:21,740
     workers extract the bar    
and clean it with sulfuric acid,

166
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,810
          then pass it          
between two rollers and a press.

167
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,280
     the rollers apply more     
 than 3,300 pounds of pressure. 

168
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,616
      workers feed the bar      
   into the press repeatedly,   

169
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,351
   each time turning the wheel  

170
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,954
        to narrow the gap       
       between the rollers      

171
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,955
  to progressively thin it out. 

172
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,826
         rolling the bar        
    scrambles its molecules,    

173
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,561
   making the silver brittle.   

174
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,497
        so they reheat it       
   to rearrange the molecules   

175
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,300
  into a regular pattern again  

176
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:52,170
     and restore flexibility    
        and malleability.       

177
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,373
    the bar now goes through    
      another rolling press     

178
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,642
       to radically reduce      
         the thickness.         

179
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,310
 this 4/10-of-an-inch-thick bar 

180
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:01,979
   becomes a thin strip a mere  
     1/100 of an inch thick.    

181
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,250
      in doing so, it also      
     lengthens dramatically     

182
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:09,921
         from 10 inches         
      to just over 4 yards.     

183
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,325
  the strip now passes through  
  a series of forming rollers,  

184
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:16,728
    which progressively curl    
    the edges up and inward     

185
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,531
         until the strip        
     becomes a hollow tube.     

186
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,067
    then the machine solders    
  the edges, sealing the tube.  

187
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,878
 the tube is still way too thick
 for making earrings and rings, 

188
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,814
        so on it goes to        
   another thinning operation.  

189
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,283
    the machine grabs one end   
           of the tube          

190
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,353
  and pulls it through a series 
        of circular dies        

191
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:44,021
    which have progressively    
       narrower diameters.      

192
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,625
          once the tube         
    is the required diameter,   

193
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,293
  a winding machine curves it.  

194
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,162
     some tubes then move on    
      to a cutting machine      

195
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,764
    which uses a diamond head   

196
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:56,434
      to engrave a pattern      
         in the surface.        

197
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,969
     to make hoop earrings,     

198
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,372
       an artisan steadies      
a piece of curved, engraved tube

199
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,107
       in locking tweezers      

200
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,177
 and solders on an earring hook,

201
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,314
         then the latch         
   into which the hook snaps.   

202
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,715
     some pieces of jewelry     

203
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,718
           incorporate          
     cubic-zirconia stones.     

204
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,788
         in this design,        
 a computer-guided laser machine

205
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,190
         has already cut        
      two patterned pieces      

206
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,392
      out of an ultra-thin      
          silver sheet.         

207
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:25,663
 a stamping machine then rounded
 each piece into a half-sphere. 

208
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,000
    the artisan now solders     
    the two halves together,    

209
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,970
   encasing the cubic-zirconia  
         stones inside.         

210
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:38,343
    then he solders the rest    
    of the earring components   

211
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,780
     made from silver tubing    
        and silver wire.        

212
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,622
         here an artisan        
      is making a pendant.      

213
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,757
 he locks cubic-zirconia stones 

214
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,761
  in between the front and back 
          frame pieces.         

215
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:01,099
  then he positions the center  
     piece within the frame,    

216
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,168
   soldering it in four spots.  

217
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:15,247
     next, he solders a ring    
  to the top of the pendant...  

218
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:20,852
     then the bail, the loop    
 for the chain, around the ring.

219
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,587
    next, into the finisher,    

220
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,190
       a rotating barrel        
       of abrasive powder       

221
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,260
        that rounds edges       
    and smoothes rough spots.   

222
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,462
  a buffing with a cloth wheel  

223
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:35,466
    then polishes the silver    
       to a mirror finish.      

224
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,602
      the same computerized     
          laser machine         

225
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,337
  that cut the sphere earrings  

226
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,539
          can also etch         
       an elaborate design      

227
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,275
   on the surface of a piece.   

228
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,144
        it can reproduce        
       virtually any image      

229
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,681
  that can be created or copied 
         with software.         

230
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:54,219
 the laser draws by pulverizing 
     a microlayer of silver.    

231
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,753
       as the laser works,      

232
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:59,758
    a built-in suction device   
 vacuums the silver powder away.

233
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,494
     besides adding strength    
         and durability,        

234
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,430
 the alloy makes sterling silver
           less porous          

235
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,165
    and, therefore, shinier.    

236
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,167
  and the copper in particular  

237
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,271
  has anti-corrosive properties 
    which reduce tarnishing.    

238
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,052
            narrator:           
    the mexican barrel chair    

239
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,589
       is sometimes called      
       montezuma's chair,       

240
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,390
   after the 9th aztec emperor  

241
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,594
     who, as legend has it,     
     enjoyed sitting in one.    

242
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:39,063
   after the spanish conquest   
      of the aztec empire,      

243
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:43,435
 these chairs were deemed seats 
 of honor for visiting v.i.p.s. 

244
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,941
         now considered         
     more rustic than regal,    

245
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,011
    anyone can sit in a chair   
        like montezuma's.       

246
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,681
   there are various versions   
   produced in mexico today,    

247
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,217
        many handcrafted        
        using techniques        

248
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,919
    that date back centuries.   

249
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,092
   with a sharp, curved blade,  

250
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,628
   the craftsman first splits   
   a chunk of mexican rosewood  

251
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,163
    into long, narrow pieces.   

252
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,366
       he cuts 36 splints       

253
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,635
         for the chair's        
    distinctive lattice work.   

254
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:20,038
     he pares down the ends     
         of each splint,        

255
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,509
   and he carves a round head   
         onto each end.         

256
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,845
 these heads will stop the rope 
        from sliding off        

257
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,981
as he ties the splints together.

258
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,718
   he pulls the back away from  
   a much longer piece of wood  

259
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,322
        and then trims it       
     to slimmer dimensions.     

260
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:41,926
     this wood is fresh from    
  a local shrub called guizema. 

261
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,262
        it's so pliable,        
      it's almost elastic,      

262
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,399
     allowing the craftsman     
   to bend it around his knee   

263
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,333
       into a "u" profile.      

264
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,536
         too much force,        
  and he could crack the wood.  

265
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:57,142
  too little, and the curvature 
         won't be right.        

266
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,011
        a thick nail used       
        on railway tracks       

267
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,879
     is now used as a hammer    

268
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,950
   as he nails a linear piece   
    of wood to a curved one,    

269
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,351
   completing his chair base.   

270
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,420
    he now loops plastic rope   

271
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:14,159
   around the tips of the two   
 splints and ties them together.

272
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,730
   he lays the tied splints to  
 holes in the guizema wood base.

273
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,839
      he angles the top end     
    of the splints diagonally   

274
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,709
and ties them together to create
 the chair's trademark lattice. 

275
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,914
  he then arranges the rounded  
    willow wood frame on top    

276
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,449
 and lashes the tied tips to it.

277
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,253
  he reinforces the chair base  
    with willow wood branches   

278
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,389
  that have been scraped flat.  

279
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:48,459
  he nails five of these poles  
    to the base of the chair.   

280
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,927
   the next craftsman secures   

281
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,063
        a rounded bundle        
       of willow branches       

282
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,265
    to the protruding poles.    

283
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,468
         this completes         
       the back framework.      

284
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,006
 another worker now strings rope
    made of agave plant fiber   

285
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:04,409
    across the seat framework   
       and ties it to it.       

286
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:10,548
he creates a strong yet flexible
  webbing to support the seat.  

287
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,551
       he now splits open       
    some locally grown reeds    

288
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,955
 and flattens them with a stone.

289
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,156
       basket-weave-style,      

290
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,158
          he interlaces         
       the flattened reeds      

291
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,759
   to create a plated material  

292
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,562
   that will be the next layer  
          for the seat.         

293
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,766
       after cutting it to      
 the exact shape and dimensions,

294
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,101
       he places it on top      
         of the webbing.        

295
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,504
    he then stitches a strip    
  of leather along the border.  

296
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,841
  his co-worker now reinforces  
        the plastic ties        

297
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,644
       at the chair base        
       with leather rope.       

298
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:43,782
   the leather ties also give   
 the base a more finished look. 

299
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:47,419
 he turns the chair on its side 
      and trims the poles.      

300
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,524
 he also carves slivers of wood 
          from the base         

301
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,926
        so that it's even       
       all the way around,      

302
00:19:54,928 --> 00:20:00,598
    allowing the chair to sit   
       level on the floor.      

303
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,002
 the next worker drapes tanned  
 and stretched pig-skin leather 

304
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,503
    over the back framework.    

305
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,942
   he trims it to the contours  
    of the bent willow wood.    

306
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,947
     he covers the reed seat    

307
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:21,619
 with more leather from the same
 hide and cuts away the excess. 

308
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,288
     using a leftover swatch    
           of leather,          

309
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,159
  he applies wax made from pig  
  and cow fat to leather rope.  

310
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,828
     the wax allows the rope    

311
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,764
  to slide easily through holes 
         in the leather         

312
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,232
      so there are no snags     

313
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,901
         as he stitches         
    the upholstery together.    

314
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:43,908
     the leather upholstery     
   is now tight and tailored.   

315
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,978
     the next worker sprays     
  mineral dye onto the leather. 

316
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,447
       it's honey-colored       
       for a warmer look,       

317
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,983
        and it also hides       
        any minor flaws.        

318
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:57,321
    after the dye, he applies   
  a protective coat of lacquer. 

319
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:01,326
   they heat an iron stamp and  
  apply it to the latticed base 

320
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:04,195
        to brand the wood       
     with the company name.     

321
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,870
     and with that job done,    
    it's time to take a seat.   

322
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:15,339
     but with so many twists    
     on this ancient design,    

323
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,142
        it could be tough       
      to decide which one.
