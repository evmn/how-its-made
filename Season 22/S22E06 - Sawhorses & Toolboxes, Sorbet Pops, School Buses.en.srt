00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:57,056
narrator: when it comes to construction, 

2
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,059
whether you're a seasoned pro or a do-it-yourselfer,      

3
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,930
having the right tools makes the job easier.      

4
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,732
sawhorses support the piece of wood you're cutting,     

5
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,068
and a toolbox keeps your implements         

6
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,236
organized and portable.     

7
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,874
sawhorses are always sold in pairs             

8
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,611
because you need two under a piece of wood      

9
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,413
to stabilize it for cutting.   

10
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,615
by pulling the hinged tray upward,     

11
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,952
the sawhorse collapses flat for transport and storage.    

12
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:28,888
this model is made from pellets             

13
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,557
of an exceptionally strong   
type of polypropylene plastic.  

14
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,093
a vacuum system draws the pellets into      

15
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,763
an injection-molding machine.  

16
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,232
the machine melts them      

17
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:44,236
then shoots the liquid into a mold.           

18
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,172
it takes about a minute for the liquid to solidify,   

19
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,709
at which point the mold automatically opens,  

20
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,046
and an articulated robotic arm removes the parts --       

21
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:58,650
for each sawhorse, two halves, the legs, and two panels     

22
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,453
which form the collapsible hinged tray   

23
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,323
that holds those legs open.   

24
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:09,195
the robot drops those parts   
at the first assembly station,  

25
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:12,865
where a worker joins each panel to a sawhorse half        

26
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,468
and applies non-slip footpads.  

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,004
these pads help keep the sawhorse stable     

28
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,339
and protect the floor from scratches.         

29
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,343
the worker lays out the parts  
for both sides of the sawhorse  

30
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,812
in a positioning fixture     

31
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,882
then activates the press a couple of times        

32
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,584
to snap the parts together.   

33
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,357
at the next station, a worker inserts ribbed rubber pads    

34
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,094
into molded holes on top of each sawhorse half.  

35
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,629
these anti-slip pads help hold  

36
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,465
large pieces of wood steady on the sawhorse.         

37
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,771
next, he lays both sawhorse halves on the work table     

38
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,173
and with a tool called a stamping arm,      

39
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,042
snaps the two panels together.  

40
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:58,310
this forms a strong hinge,    

41
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:01,847
which opens and collapses the tray.            

42
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,583
the sawhorse is now finished   

43
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,919
and heads to the packaging station.    

44
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,854
there, a worker stacks two sawhorses,          

45
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,058
then, with a foot pedal, activates a machine       

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,493
which binds them with a plastic strap.      

47
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,799
then she tapes on a wrap-around label.       

48
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,111
have tools, will travel.     

49
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,815
this two-piece toolbox      

50
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:39,084
consists of a large storage tub on the bottom          

51
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,320
and a spacious toolbox on top.  

52
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,226
like a rolling suitcase,     

53
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,696
it has two large polypropylene wheels       

54
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:55,101
with molded-on rubber treads  
and a collapsible pull handle.  

55
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,306
a toolbox doesn't have to withstand pressure    

56
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,509
bearing down on it, so it's made of standard,    

57
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,978
rather than high-strength, polypropylene.          

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,349
the injection-molding process is the same.           

59
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,922
the storage tub, the toolbox bottom,       

60
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,860
and the toolbox lid are each molded separately.   

61
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,999
in the assembly area,      

62
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,870
workers apply an adhesive label on the front of the toolbox   

63
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:36,274
then install the latches for locking the lid.       

64
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,212
the latches slide into molded slots.     

65
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,950
after inserting a removable tray,        

66
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,685
workers install the lid     

67
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,022
with a few strikes of      
a non-marring urethane hammer.  

68
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:53,491
both lid and latches snap in easily          

69
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,029
because the polypropylene is still hot and flexible.    

70
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,231
once it cools and becomes rigid,             

71
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,766
the lid and latches can't dislodge.         

72
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,569
to assemble each wheel,     

73
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,974
workers position a star nut   
and steel axle into the wheel,  

74
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,109
then, with an assembly ram,   

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,047
press the axle into the star nut to lock the parts together.   

76
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,049
they snap a wheel onto each side              

77
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,786
of the tub portion of the toolbox,         

78
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,790
then, with a press, force the wheels         

79
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,759
into their final locked position.         

80
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,663
once the toolbox and tub portions         

81
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,933
are each separately assembled,  

82
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:37,802
workers hang a parts tray on the rim of the tub      

83
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,338
then sit the toolbox on the tray              

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,210
and lock it in place with two large side hinges.   

85
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:49,949
and that completes construction of this workshop on wheels.   

86
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,500
narrator: traditionally, sorbets have been dished up   

87
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,636
between courses to refresh the palate,      

88
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,637
but served in a squeezed-up pop,              

89
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,908
a sorbet becomes a snack you can grab anytime --     

90
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,109
no need for scoops, spoons, or dishes.            

91
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,113
just squeeze the sorbet out of the paper sleeve.     

92
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,414
now that's refreshing.      

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,589
a long favorite of foodies, fruit sorbet has gone mainstream           

94
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,791
with these squeeze-up pops.   

95
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,527
more fun than a few scoops in a dish,   

96
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,464
sorbet pops are also lower in calories        

97
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,799
than a lot of other snacks.   

98
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:44,670
they start with freeze-dried rice syrup.  

99
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,472
they pour it into a mixing vat  

100
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,807
that's a mega version of a home blender.        

101
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,343
they add strawberry puree.    

102
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:55,880
this is the main ingredient of the sorbet pops.       

103
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:01,086
the berries were pulped within 12 hours of harvest.   

104
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,690
the next ingredient is cane sugar.          

105
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:08,827
it's followed by strawberry essence --     

106
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,030
compounds extracted from the berries         

107
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:12,430
for more intense flavor.     

108
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,701
they turn on the tap for the final ingredient --   

109
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,169
water.              

110
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,171
it's time to close the lid    

111
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,840
and power up this industrial blender.     

112
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:27,112
the mixer has four blades that turn at a high velocity.  

113
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,581
they whip up the sorbet ingredients      

114
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,750
to the consistency of a fruit smoothie.       

115
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,456
the sorbet mixture then flows into refrigerated pipes     

116
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,792
that chill the mixture to 40 degrees fahrenheit.    

117
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,595
the pipes wind around the factory     

118
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,265
and finally deliver it to holding tanks.        

119
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:49,868
inside, an agitator swirls the chilled mixture    

120
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,338
to maintain           
the smoothie-like consistency.  

121
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,076
once a tank is full,      
a technician tests the acidity  

122
00:07:57,078 --> 00:08:01,080
and the level of suspended sugars in the mixture.      

123
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,215
if the levels are right,     

124
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,752
they transfer the mixture into a continuous freezer.    

125
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,557
it pumps air into the sorbet mix,       

126
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,759
and it churns and scraps it   

127
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,296
against the freezing-cold walls of the machine.         

128
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,964
cool water runs through the motor      

129
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,101
to keep it from overheating as it freezes the sorbet.    

130
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,838
this is only a partial freezing to keep the sorbet        

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,110
soft enough to be pumped into the paper squeeze tubes.  

132
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,979
a device with little robotic fingers   

133
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,049
pries the papers tubes from a stack           

134
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:40,519
and deposits them in slots in a moving tray.    

135
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,922
the tubes are in position to receive    

136
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,058
the partially frozen sorbet,   

137
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,528
and because the sorbet is only partially frozen,    

138
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,997
it is able to now flow through conduits.        

139
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,599
frozen solid, it couldn't make the journey   

140
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,068
to the squeeze tubes.      

141
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,004
as the sorbet is pumped into the paper sleeves,     

142
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,340
its temperature is critical.   

143
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:06,345
it is precisely 37.8 degrees fahrenheit.     

144
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,414
one degree cooler        

145
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,881
and it would be too thick to pump.             

146
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,084
a degree warmer, and ice crystals would form   

147
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:15,287
during the final freezing.    

148
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,424
the next machine collects foil lids from a pack,              

149
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:22,026
using rubber heads with tiny magnets in the center.             

150
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,631
it deposits the lids onto the sorbet-filled tubes.  

151
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,769
the foil lids stick to the glue-coated rims.     

152
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,108
this line fills 280 paper sleeves        

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,710
with fruit sorbet per minute.  

154
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:43,115
that's just under 17,000 per hour.         

155
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:47,719
an iron applies heat to the lids to further melt the glue     

156
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,455
and provide a water-tight seal.              

157
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,990
it happens fast         

158
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,794
so the sorbet doesn't have time to start melting.        

159
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,132
sealed and partially frozen,   

160
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:03,468
the sorbet pops cascade into crates.       

161
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,737
each one holds about 100 pops,  

162
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,739
so they don't need to keep count.          

163
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,810
and then it's into the blast freezer,        

164
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,913
also know as the shock freezer.            

165
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,817
fans circulate the cold air   

166
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,420
to rapidly lower the temperature of the sorbet pops,       

167
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,757
bringing it down to -24 degrees fahrenheit.    

168
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,359
this fast freezing prevents   

169
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,961
the formation of large ice crystals      

170
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,363
that would damage        

171
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,599
the consistency and flavor of the sorbet pops.       

172
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,570
out of the freezer,       

173
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:42,541
a mechanized arm grabs and opens cardboard boxes.         

174
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:50,382
a pusher shoves the sorbet pops into the boxes.         

175
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:54,520
and they're ready to grab and squeeze.       

176
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:18,277
narrator: the big yellow school bus    

177
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,878
on the road to an education.   

178
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,214
it all started in the 19th century       

179
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,017
with horse-drawn trucks known as kid hacks.       

180
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,819
the word "hack" was short for hackney carriage.      

181
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,355
in the 20th century, they were motorized       

182
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,824
and became known as school buses.         

183
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,762
every school day,        

184
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,232
children across north america wait for the school bus.     

185
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,835
appearance-wise, it's hard to miss.        

186
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,172
big and yellow, it is deliberately conspicuous,          

187
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,374
designed to stand out in traffic             

188
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,511
so other drivers slow down and take notice.    

189
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,317
manufacturing starts with a support structure --   

190
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,320
the steel underframe.      

191
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,789
they arrange several short rails              

192
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,991
down the top of two long frame rails.     

193
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,462
these cross rails will link the long rails     

194
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,864
and provide strategic support.  

195
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,667
using the lift, they raise the long rails,    

196
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,337
and the cross rails slide into position       

197
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,206
just under the rims of the long ones.        

198
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,676
now, in a fixture that pins the rails together,  

199
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,811
workers bolt them together.   

200
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:32,017
with the school-bus underframe assembled, they roll in     

201
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,355
two enormous wheel axles complete with brakes.      

202
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,357
overhead cables lift the bus frame        

203
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,894
and workers guide it into place on the axles.          

204
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,503
they attach the axles to the frame           

205
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:57,842
with metal brackets, shackles, and spacers where needed.    

206
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,979
the chassis is ready for the engine.         

207
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,649
they lower it onto the front of the frame   

208
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,852
and secure it with bolts.    

209
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:10,588
the school-bus engine packs a lot of power.      

210
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,192
it's diesel-fueled with six cylinders.       

211
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,328
next up is the front cal assembly,    

212
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,463
which includes the instrument panel       

213
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,465
and steering column.       

214
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,668
a workers wires the steering wheel     

215
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,606
to the controls in the column and slides it into place.    

216
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,208
they mount the tires and rims --               

217
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,546
four on the back axle to handle the heavier passenger load    

218
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,548
and two on the front.      

219
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,085
using a multi-pronged tool,   

220
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,154
the worker tightens numerous nuts      

221
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,556
to fasten the wheels to the axles.          

222
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:52,497
they now encase the engine with a fiberglass hood.     

223
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,566
the hood has been pre-painted  

224
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:57,168
and equipped with cross-view mirrors and headlights.     

225
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,505
they bolt it to the vehicle frame,      

226
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,509
and after adding antifreeze and coolant,           

227
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,378
the bus is technically drivable.            

228
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,848
they roll it over to a test station        

229
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,583
to check the brakes.       

230
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:20,258
the wheels turn on rollers so the bus runs in one spot.   

231
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,593
a computer monitors the performance         

232
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,862
of both the front and back brakes         

233
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,531
as a driver applies them.    

234
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,538
they now move on to build the school-bus body.  

235
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,274
the body starts with the floor.             

236
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,011
they unwind double-sided galvanized steel  

237
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,948
into a machine that slices it into panels.   

238
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,219
it also cuts holes to be used for assembly.     

239
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,954
a forming machine folds the sides         

240
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,623
to create support beams.     

241
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:57,295
two more steel beams will really stiffen the floor panel.     

242
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:02,233
a worker positions those beams on the panel,          

243
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,570
and an automated machine welds them to it.        

244
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,908
it feeds the floor panel to the welder incrementally   

245
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,912
so it can spot weld down the length of the beams.  

246
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,387
it takes dozens of welds to solidly secure        

247
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,556
the steel supports.       

248
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:32,396
and with those reinforcements, the floor panel is complete.   

249
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,534
it's ready for assembly.     

250
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:39,337
workers arrange several panels upside down           

251
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,940
in a precise configuration.   

252
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,477
then it's into a second automated welder    

253
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:49,014
that joins them to make one school-bus floor.  

254
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,350
after manually welding pockets for wheels,           

255
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,488
a machine called the floor flip picks up the bus floor      

256
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,323
and turns it rightside up.    

257
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:07,299
they're now ready to build the passenger compartment,    

258
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,334
so stay tuned.          

259
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,653
narrator: a school bus transports precious cargo --   

260
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,721
children.            

261
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,590
to hold the average bus together,            

262
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:37,062
they use an incredible 6,100 rivets, bolts, and screws             

263
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,464
and make a total of 840 welds.  

264
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,466
for the maker of school buses,  

265
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,035
there's strength in those numbers.        

266
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,073
to build the frame        

267
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,609
for the school-bus walls and ceiling,           

268
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,745
they bend steel beams into bow shapes.         

269
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:59,084
a hydraulic machine with pushers does the job in seconds,     

270
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,520
achieving an exact radius.    

271
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:10,896
the bows will serve as ribs for the school-bus body.     

272
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,301
they make several bows for each bus.          

273
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:20,705
the precise number depends on the bus size and capacity.    

274
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,641
workers plug the ends of the bows       

275
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,979
into holes in steel rails and secure them with bolts.   

276
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,249
they weld lateral supports higher up,            

277
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,186
and the cage-like skeleton   
of the school bus takes shape.  

278
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,192
they're now ready to build on this framework.   

279
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,863
they attach           
the metal windshield surround.  

280
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,131
the team then moves       

281
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:51,803
the steel side sheets and skirting into place.     

282
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:56,341
they secure these panels with super-strong adhesive    

283
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,944
and numerous rivets.       

284
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,816
using cables and nylon straps,  

285
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,752
they pull steel sheets to the roof structure      

286
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,488
to make them conform to the contours.         

287
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,959
the steel is 20-gage --     

288
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:20,098
a grade that's flexible enough to be easily bent.        

289
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,434
the cables hold the steel panels tightly to the roof structure  

290
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,503
while the workers rivet them to it.        

291
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:29,106
the number of rivets      
and the strength of the joints  

292
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,243
are among many government safety standards   

293
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,978
the school bus must meet.    

294
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,114
working from the inside,     

295
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,918
they glue fiberglass insulation into the pockets of the cage   

296
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,254
to keep the bus warm in winter and cool in summer.       

297
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,190
the insulation will also muffle road noise   

298
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,927
and absorb some of the student chatter   

299
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,730
for a quieter ride.       

300
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,000
the team installs steel panels on the ceiling.         

301
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,669
these panels have tiny perforations      

302
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:01,106
to allow sound to escape into the insulation.       

303
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,810
they tape up the windows and doors      

304
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,412
and sand some areas       

305
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:12,083
as they now prepare to paint the exterior of the bus.     

306
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,953
the paint, national bus yellow,             

307
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,956
takes the metal from dull to bold.        

308
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:22,093
this shade was developed specifically for school buses  

309
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,397
and can be noticed even with peripheral vision.   

310
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:33,038
with the paint now dry, they open the doors       

311
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,640
and lay a plywood subfloor inside.    

312
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,441
it too will absorb noise.    

313
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,777
an employee drives the chassis  

314
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,648
over to the school-bus-body production line,         

315
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,783
and parks it.          

316
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,522
using cables, they lift the bus body      

317
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,656
over to the chassis.       

318
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,461
at over three and a half tons, it's hefty.           

319
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,934
they gently lower it onto the frame rails       

320
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,503
and mate the front to the hood.              

321
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:11,776
they tie the body to the frame with heavy-duty clips.      

322
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,611
they arrange the seating     

323
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,214
to surround the passengers with cushioning.         

324
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,952
this creates compartments around the occupants       

325
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,222
to protect them in a collision.           

326
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,626
outside, a worker applies school-bus lettering.      

327
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,431
another worker presses      

328
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,034
an adhesive-backed manufacturer's emblem      

329
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,102
to the hood.           

330
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,437
they equip the bus        

331
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,240
with the flashing lights and stop signs          

332
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,842
to get the attention of other drivers         

333
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,578
when children are loading and unloading.    

334
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,648
they also install a crossing gate to keep children            

335
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,051
within the bus driver's sight line.           

336
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:58,056
they test all of the warning lights    

337
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,724
and safety devices.       

338
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,598
and satisfied that everything is operational,          

339
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,934
the bus rolls off the production line.     

340
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,538
it's taken a day and a half to build it,           

341
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,741
and when it comes to an education,          

342
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,210
it's ready to deliver.      

343
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,824
