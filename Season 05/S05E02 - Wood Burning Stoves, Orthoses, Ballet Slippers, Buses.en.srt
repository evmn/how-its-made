00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,157
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,594
     wood-burning stoves...     

3
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,065
         ...orthoses...         

4
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,571
      ...ballet slippers...     

5
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,743
          ...and buses.         

6
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,252
       wood-burning stoves      

7
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,721
       do more than create      
        a cozy ambience.        

8
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:00,325
  they're also powerful enough  
    to heat an entire house.    

9
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,928
      more and more people      
   are installing a woodstove   

10
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,397
  as an additional heat source  
         in their home.         

11
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,999
        it's economical,        
 and the new low-emission models

12
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,636
            are more            
    environmentally friendly.   

13
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,342
         every woodstove        
      has a fire baffle --      

14
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,812
    a stainless-steel barrier   
     above the burning wood     

15
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:23,348
      that shields the top      
     from the intense heat.     

16
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,618
 the baffle also slows down the 
  smoke exiting by the chimney, 

17
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:31,089
 which reduces the upward draft 
  that the rising heat creates. 

18
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,758
        production begins       
     with large steel sheets    

19
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,627
 that are 1/4 of an inch thick. 

20
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,497
     a computer-guided laser    
         cuts out pieces        

21
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,500
  that workers will shape into  
 the various parts of the stove.

22
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,169
    the laser slices through    
        the metal quickly       

23
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,371
   and with extreme precision.  

24
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,840
       and because it cuts      
       with intense light       

25
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,375
   rather than punching force,  

26
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,512
           the pieces           
    have neat, smooth edges.    

27
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,916
   workers use a strong magnet  
 to lift and transfer the pieces

28
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,385
  to the next production area.  

29
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,722
        the largest piece       
     becomes the surround --    

30
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,059
  the part that forms the sides 
   and back of the woodstove.   

31
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:11,996
  workers use a machine called  
   a press brake to shape it.   

32
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:15,734
        a computer guides       
   this large hydraulic press   

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,171
     to bend the flat steel     
   in exactly the right spots.  

34
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,817
 now they position the surround 
       in an assembly jig       

35
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,754
        to keep it steady       
         during welding.        

36
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,291
     after welding the front    
  of the stove to the surround, 

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,892
    they weld the air intake,   

38
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:44,763
  which allows oxygen to enter  
   the stove to feed the fire.  

39
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,302
    next they weld the top --   
       the fire baffle --       

40
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,304
 and air channels near the top, 

41
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,241
     which are also designed    
  to feed the fire with oxygen. 

42
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,377
     the quality of welding     
   in a woodstove is critical   

43
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:03,849
  because the joints have to be 
 able to withstand extreme heat.

44
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,122
    now they weld the bottom    
          of the stove.         

45
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,624
   it has a hole in the middle  

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,894
     through which you sweep    
 the embers to an ash pan below.

47
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,265
 now they weld the flue collar, 

48
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,401
  the steel ring that attaches  
   the stove to the flue pipe   

49
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,804
   that leads to the chimney.   

50
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,877
   workers now bolt the stove   
         to a pedestal.         

51
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:37,215
          the pedestal          
  is also made of welded steel. 

52
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,818
meanwhile, the door takes shape.

53
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,488
 they glue a fiberglass rope to 
 the perimeter of the doorframe 

54
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,223
   using a silicone-based glue  

55
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,893
        that's resistant        
    to extreme temperatures.    

56
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,429
   this cord prevents air from  
   seeping in through the door  

57
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:55,367
      and fueling the fire      
         out of control.        

58
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,836
        after installing        
    the locking door handle,    

59
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,072
   they weld the door hinges.   

60
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,782
      the stove's interior,     
      where the wood burns,     

61
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,518
            is known            
   as the combustion chamber.   

62
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,387
    they line it with bricks    

63
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,191
    to protect the walls from   
  warping in the intense heat.  

64
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:24,863
bricks do deteriorate over time,
 but it's easy to replace them. 

65
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:30,134
the last steel part they install
   is the cap for the ash pan.  

66
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,869
    now an automated conveyer   

67
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,739
       transfers the stove      
      to the paint station,     

68
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:39,211
  where a robotic arm sprays on 
 a coat of heat-resistant paint.

69
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,758
    once the paint air-dries,   

70
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,895
    a worker removes the door   
   to install its glass panel.  

71
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,965
         this isn't your        
  run-of-the-mill window glass. 

72
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,901
      it contains ceramic,      
        which enables it        

73
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:07,839
 to withstand temperatures up to
almost 2,000 degrees fahrenheit.

74
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,309
 with the glass panel in place, 

75
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,510
        workers can apply       
       decorative features      

76
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,446
    and information stickers.   

77
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,656
 then they put the door back on 
        and lock it shut.       

78
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,460
          they rivet on         
       the company logo...      

79
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,664
      ...then install a fan     
          in the back.          

80
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:37,202
   the fan blows out the heat   
    that the stove generates.   

81
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,738
   when the wood-burning stove  
       leaves the factory,      

82
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,874
    its coat of paint is dry,   
       but not yet cured.       

83
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,476
        the heat cures it       

84
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,813
   when you fire up your stove  
       for the first time.      

85
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,559
 narrator: orthoses are devices 
such as arch supports and braces

86
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,428
          that address          
    a joint or muscle problem   

87
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,630
   in the back or extremities.  

88
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,700
     an orthosis can provide    
       artificial support,      

89
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,502
 prevent or correct a deformity,

90
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,438
      or improve how a weak     
   or painful area functions.   

91
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:17,976
 you can buy an orthosis off the
 shelf or have one custom-made. 

92
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,116
producing a custom-made orthosis

93
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,785
     starts with a thorough     
          examination.          

94
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,921
    a certified professional,   
      called an orthotist,      

95
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,523
  analyzes the problem area --  

96
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,925
  in the case of this patient,  
            the feet.           

97
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:41,066
after a few manual manipulations
   to test the range of motion  

98
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,535
 and pinpoint weakness or pain, 

99
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,670
          the orthotist         
    uses various instruments    

100
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,007
    to measure the angles of    
the different parts of the feet.

101
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,476
          then it's on          
     to specialized devices     

102
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,945
   that analyze foot position   
          and movement          

103
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,413
   during standing and walking  

104
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,150
       and how body weight      
  is distributed onto the feet. 

105
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,887
          in this scan,         
       the red areas show       

106
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:05,424
 that more weight is landing on 
the left foot than on the right.

107
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,762
     next, a 3-d impression     
            in foam.            

108
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,764
    it goes to the production   
           department,          

109
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,501
    where technicians fill it   
          with plaster.         

110
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,972
   once it dries, they extract  
  an exact model of both feet.  

111
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,376
     now they can construct     
  the orthosis piece by piece.  

112
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,912
     most of the components     

113
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,980
   are made of different types  
        of polyurethane,        

114
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,316
  a lightweight thermoplastic.  

115
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,453
      each type is designed     
  to produce a specific effect  

116
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,122
      at a different phase      
   of the patient's footstep.   

117
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,126
   for example, the blue base   
  is made of rigid polyurethane 

118
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,928
       that holds the foot      
    in the correct position.    

119
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:48,065
   at the front, dense, black   
  polyurethane helps propulsion 

120
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,270
       and reduces stress       
    on that side of the foot.   

121
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,673
    they cover the assembled    
  orthosis with a sheet of glue 

122
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,142
  and put it in a vacuum press. 

123
00:07:58,212 --> 00:08:01,412
     the press applies heat     
    to activate the adhesive.   

124
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:04,549
      it sucks out the air      
     between the components     

125
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,685
       and compresses them      
        tightly together.       

126
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,354
  when the orthosis comes out,  

127
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,090
   they place it on the model   
   of the corresponding foot.   

128
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,693
        then it goes into       
    a different vacuum press    

129
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,194
    to mold it to the shape.    

130
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,465
    they add made-to-measure    
        corrective parts        

131
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,766
        with latex foam.        

132
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,368
then, using hypoallergenic glue,

133
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:29,240
        line the orthosis       
    with a soft polyurethane.   

134
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,376
    all that's left to do now   
      is buff the orthosis.     

135
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,713
 this smoothes all the surfaces.

136
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,650
     to ensure the orthosis     
         fits correctly,        

137
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,320
the patient redoes the key tests
        while wearing it.       

138
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,322
       remember that scan       
       showing red areas?       

139
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,856
        they're gone now        

140
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,694
 because the patient's feet now 
  bear his body weight equally. 

141
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,665
    this patient has arrived    

142
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,535
  with a doctor's prescription  
        for a knee brace.       

143
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,404
          the orthotist         
     analyzes his mobility,     

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,140
     flection, and balance,     

145
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,142
    then sends the technical    
         specifications         

146
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,144
        to the production       
           department.          

147
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,714
 there, technicians make a model
           of the leg.          

148
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,684
    they begin by positioning   
  the leg at a 12-degree angle  

149
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,353
         and wrapping it        
      in plaster bandages.      

150
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,222
        while waiting for       
 the fast-set plaster to harden,

151
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,625
       the patient chooses      
      a decorative pattern      

152
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,294
         for the outside        
          of the brace.         

153
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,698
        the hardened cast       
        serves as a mold.       

154
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:31,903
technicians pour in plaster, let
it harden, then remove the cast.

155
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,712
  after smoothing the surface,  
  they draw technical markings, 

156
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,114
  then install the lightweight  
         aluminum joints        

157
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,884
  that will enable the orthosis 
            to bend.            

158
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,588
 now they run a sheet of plastic
        through an oven.        

159
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:54,592
  this is high-memory plastic,  
 meaning that when you form it, 

160
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,629
     it remembers the shape     
        and maintains it.       

161
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,401
  the design the patient chose  
comes printed on transfer paper.

162
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,203
  they use a laser thermometer  

163
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,672
      to ensure the plastic     
  is at the perfect temperature 

164
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,009
        for the pigments        
     to penetrate properly.     

165
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:15,613
 they carefully position the hot
decorative plastic on the model.

166
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,215
       using a vacuum bag,      

167
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,019
     they remove the air and    
  press the plastic on tightly. 

168
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:26,291
  the plastic sets in about two 
 minutes, maintaining the form. 

169
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,360
  they cut the required shape,  

170
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,930
        line the inside,        
   and sand the edges smooth.   

171
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,871
 finally, they attach straps to 
 fasten the orthosis to the leg.

172
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,241
  the orthotist checks the fit  
         on the patient,        

173
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,846
     then runs various tests    
    to make sure the orthosis   

174
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,182
        is doing exactly        
    what it's designed to do.   

175
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,397
      narrator: ever wonder     
 how ballerinas manage to dance 

176
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,066
   on the tips of their toes?   

177
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,402
   it takes years of training,  
        remarkable skill,       

178
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,738
  and special ballet slippers.  

179
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,606
  these toe shoes are handmade  

180
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,410
         in what's truly        
 a manufacturing pas de deux -- 

181
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,879
       a graceful pairing       
     of traditional methods     

182
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,214
      and modern materials.     

183
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:31,022
they sew the toe shoe's exterior
   with three pieces of satin.  

184
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:35,026
  they cut those pieces using a 
press equipped with a metal die.

185
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,495
        it slices through       
     enough fabric at a time    

186
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,564
  to make four pairs of shoes.  

187
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,767
   they also cut a pure cotton  
      lining for each piece     

188
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,970
  to protect the dancer's feet  
        from irritation.        

189
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,773
       this v-shaped piece      
       is called the vamp.      

190
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,642
   it'll become the front half  
          of the shoe.          

191
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,644
 the seamstress extends the "v" 

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,580
          by attaching          
   the two other satin pieces,  

193
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,982
   called the quarter panels.   

194
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,918
   they'll form the back half   
          of the shoe.          

195
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,655
  she sews the ends of the "v"  
  together, making a heel seam, 

196
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,126
      which she reinforces      
      with a rayon ribbon.      

197
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,596
 then she feeds the same type of
ribbon through a special machine

198
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,532
      that folds it in half     
       over a drawstring.       

199
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:18,903
       she stitches it to       
 the top perimeter of the shoe. 

200
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,413
     this encased drawstring    
     will enable the dancer     

201
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,550
        to pull the shoe        
    tightly around her foot.    

202
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,620
  now they put the satin upper  
       onto a wooden form       

203
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,288
      to check the sizing.      

204
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,489
    it's absolutely critical    

205
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,291
   that the height of the vamp  
           be correct           

206
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,359
    to within 1/8 of an inch.   

207
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,962
   if it's even slightly off,   

208
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,031
       the top of the shoe      
will cut into the dancer's foot.

209
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,702
       the shoemaker nails      
 the cotton lining to an insole 

210
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,303
   on the bottom of the form.   

211
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,506
       the insole is made       
 of rigid cardboard for support,

212
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,775
       imbued with plastic      
        for flexibility.        

213
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,178
 after trimming off the excess, 

214
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,580
       he glues the lining      
        onto the insole,        

215
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,182
   making neat little pleats.   

216
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,051
      once the glue dries,      
       he removes the nail      

217
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,853
  and trims the excess pleating 

218
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,422
     to eliminate any bumps     
  that would irritate the foot. 

219
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,726
  now they sculpt the toe box,  

220
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,663
        the hard encasing       
   inside the tip of the shoe.  

221
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,598
   it's made of papier-mâché,   

222
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:25,803
only instead of paper and paste,
   they use fabric and paste.   

223
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,939
   then they soften up a piece  
 of resin-coated cotton in water

224
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,009
      and apply it on top.      

225
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,484
  next they saturate two pieces 
      of burlap with paste      

226
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,555
    and apply them, one after   
   the other, over the cotton.  

227
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,959
   the paste is made of flour,  
        water, starches,        

228
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,760
              and a             
 rubber-and-plastic-based resin 

229
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,897
          that hardens          
    to a semi-flexible state.   

230
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,034
 that's key, because the toe box
     has to be stiff enough     

231
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,902
      to bear the dancer's      
          full weight,          

232
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,073
   yet flexible enough so that  
 the ballerina can move fluidly.

233
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:13,218
now the final layer of fabric --
     a piece of pure cotton.    

234
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:20,057
they wrap the toe box in plastic
    to keep the hammer clean    

235
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,059
  as they square off the front, 

236
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,729
      creating what's known     
        as the platform.        

237
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,401
   then they press the toe box  
     onto a piece of marble     

238
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,670
   to make it completely flat.  

239
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,474
  they verify that the platform 
      is perfectly square.      

240
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,878
      if not, the ballerina     
        will topple over.       

241
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,682
    after letting the toe box   
        dry for 24 hours,       

242
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,119
  they glue the lining over it  
      with contact cement.      

243
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,758
 they trim off the excess, then 
 glue the satin over the lining,

244
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,827
    forming delicate pleats.    

245
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,561
they use lighter glue this time,

246
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,498
     because contact cement     
     would stain the fabric.    

247
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,436
   they apply a foam filler to  
 even out the shoe's underside, 

248
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,972
          then coat it          
 with high-strength vinyl glue. 

249
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,441
    they apply the same glue    
           to a sole,           

250
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,443
   then leave both to air dry.  

251
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,845
         24 hours later,        

252
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,648
    they put them on a heater   
 set to 200 degrees fahrenheit. 

253
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:21,519
 this reactivates the dried glue
     in about half a minute.    

254
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,525
       they apply the sole      

255
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:32,163
then put the shoe in a press for
15 seconds to solidify the bond.

256
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,737
  now they can remove the shoe  
         from the form.         

257
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,672
   the sole is made of suede,   

258
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,941
       a material that has      
 just the right amount of grip. 

259
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,810
          it's nonslip,         

260
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:50,548
 yet still enables the dancer to
glide smoothly across the floor.

261
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,885
   the last step is to glue in  
    a white suede sockliner.    

262
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,487
it cushions the ballerina's foot

263
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,689
          and keeps it          
      from slipping forward     

264
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,459
 when she's dancing on her toes.

265
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,502
    narrator: a city's fleet    
   of public transit vehicles   

266
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,172
  might include standard buses, 
    low-floor buses, or both.   

267
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,042
      low-floor buses have      
   a special kneeling feature.  

268
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,544
        when they pull up       
        to the bus stop,        

269
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
   they can mechanically lower  
    themselves to curb height   

270
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,384
     to make boarding easier    
 for children, senior citizens, 

271
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,753
     and handicapped people.    

272
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,592
       this low-floor bus       
         is 40 feet long        

273
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,661
          and can carry         
    more than 80 passengers.    

274
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,931
       to build the bus's       
       internal structure,      

275
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,067
workers put stainless-steel bars
          into a press.         

276
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:47,205
       it applies between       
  90 and 110 tons of pressure,  

277
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,207
          bending them          
     to the required shape.     

278
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,878
 workers assemble the structural
    pieces on a support frame   

279
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,279
     called an assembly jig.    

280
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,615
            they use            
  an electronic inspection arm  

281
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,684
      to verify their work.     

282
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,689
     once they've assembled     
       the roof structure       

283
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,893
  and the side structures, they 
bring them together for welding.

284
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,633
         everything goes        
       on a rotating jig.       

285
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,970
          it turns like         
       a giant rotisserie,      

286
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,771
   giving workers easy access   

287
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:24,008
   to whatever part of the bus  
       they need to weld.       

288
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:31,849
  when the welding is finished, 
they turn the bus right side up.

289
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,851
     they put the structure     
           on a dolly           

290
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,520
   and release it from the jig  

291
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,122
    so that they can move it    
    down the production line.   

292
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,328
           meanwhile,           
  the stainless-steel structure 

293
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,563
    for the floor of the bus    
          takes shape.          

294
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,134
 once that's complete, it's back
 onto the rotating assembly jig 

295
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,737
           to weld it           
  to the rest of the structure. 

296
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,142
        this bus factory        
      uses stainless steel      

297
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,011
    because it stands up well   
          to corrosion.         

298
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,615
  transit systems need to keep  
  these buses running full-time 

299
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,150
       for up to 20 years.      

300
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,818
       less rusting means       

301
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,155
         fewer expensive        
   and time-consuming repairs.  

302
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,095
        workers now move        
     the completed structure    

303
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,497
 to another part of the factory 

304
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,032
 where they spray the underframe
        and lower section       

305
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,902
          with a black,         
     anti-abrasion coating.     

306
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,371
      this protects against     
      the noise and damage      

307
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,574
           that stones          
   and other road debris cause  

308
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,676
    when they hit the bottom    
           of the bus.          

309
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,713
       next, workers apply      
       high-strength glue       

310
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,950
     to the floor structure     
    and lay down a subfloor.    

311
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,623
    then they drive in screws   
       for reinforcement.       

312
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,726
          now they turn         
       the bus upside down      

313
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,263
    to install four tanks of    
 compressed air under the roof. 

314
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,065
three are for the brake systems,

315
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,468
    the fourth for the doors    
      and other mechanisms.     

316
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,069
     melamine ceiling panels    

317
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,772
         hide everything        
     that's under the roof.     

318
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,145
   next, the engine's radiator  
 goes in at the rear of the bus.

319
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,281
    then workers turn the bus   
       right side up again      

320
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,951
    and lay down a waterproof   
      vinyl floor covering      

321
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,553
    that's specially designed   

322
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,823
          to withstand          
     heavy-duty transit use.    

323
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,426
  they cover the sides and roof 
     with fiberglass panels.    

324
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,961
      to prevent corrosion,     

325
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,097
        workers use glue        
  rather than screws or rivets. 

326
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,034
        then they attach        
 the fiberglass front of the bus

327
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,435
          to the rest.          

328
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,704
     the bus's low-emission     
          diesel engine         

329
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,107
     arrives at the factory     
       already assembled.       

330
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,508
        workers attach it       
       to the transmission      

331
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,645
         and drive shaft        
   in the engine compartment.   

332
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,914
 buses without air-conditioning 

333
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,516
      have sliding windows      
        that open widely.       

334
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,421
    on air-conditioned buses,   
 just a small top section opens.

335
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,861
         the upholstery         
 on the molded fiberglass seats 

336
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,197
     is a velour-like fabric    
   woven onto a strong canvas,  

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,201
         then glued onto        
      a fiberglass insert.      

338
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,602
        this construction       
       makes it impossible      

339
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,739
  for vandals to slash the seat 
          with a knife.         

340
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,941
         workers install        
       the driver's seat,       

341
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,343
       the steering wheel,      
      and all the controls,     

342
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:17,148
including the toggle switch that
 activates the kneeling feature.

343
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,352
    this bus also has a ramp    
        for wheelchairs.        

344
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,021
         a safety system        
   locks the accelerator pedal  

345
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,090
     and applies the brakes     

346
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,691
 to prevent the bus from moving 

347
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,628
    when the ramp or kneeling   
    feature are in operation.   

348
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,432
        the finished bus        

349
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,369
      undergoes a half-hour     
     water-infiltration test    

350
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,971
with all of the systems running.

351
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,840
this ensures there are no leaks.

352
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,847
  at every phase of production, 

353
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:54,051
        the factory does        
  a quality-control inspection, 

354
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,387
    checking everything from    
mechanical safety to finishings,

355
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,257
           right down           
   to the tiniest of details.
