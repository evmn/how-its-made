narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,028
winter jackets, animation,

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,099
mushrooms, and gold rings.

6
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,906
as anyone who's shivered through a cold winter knows,

7
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,109
you've got your run-of-the-mill
winter jackets

8
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,311
and then, those really warm winter jackets

9
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,380
that can run up to $1,000.

10
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,985
the difference is what they're made of and how they're made.

11
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:57,189
a top-of-the-line winter jacket
gives you the warmth

12
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,790
without the weight.

13
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,659
it's waterproof and comfortable --

14
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,063
no bulky stuffing or constrictive styling.

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,866
the designer draws a pattern by computer.

16
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,870
a software program then adapts the pattern to different sizes.

17
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:15,073
a giant printer puts it to paper.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,077
the tailor spreads out several layers

19
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,480
of each of the fabrics that'll make up the jacket.

20
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,988
he lays out the pattern...

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,761
...then pins it in place.

22
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,570
next, he cuts through several layers of fabric at a time

23
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,239
with electric scissors.

24
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,175
these scissors maneuver much like a jigsaw

25
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,579
around the lines and curves of the pattern pieces.

26
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,715
the finished jacket will actually be made up

27
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,850
of two jackets sewn together --

28
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,452
an insulation jacket on the inside

29
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,889
and a windbreaker on the outside.

30
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,933
the inner insulation jacket begins with a nylon lining.

31
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,735
then they layer the key components --

32
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,073
a film to stabilize and protect
the insulation,

33
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,343
then the thick polyester insulation itself.

34
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:28,613
at this point, the insulation layer is larger than the lining.

35
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,617
this ensures that every inch of the jacket will have insulation.

36
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,819
working with one piece at a time,

37
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,355
they stitch the layers together.

38
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,292
each line of stitching is tacked
at the beginning and at the end

39
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,960
for added strength.

40
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,365
they cut off the excess insulation,

41
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,100
then sew an overlock around each piece

42
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,970
to hold the remaining insulation
solidly in place.

43
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,974
once they've completed each piece of the insulation jacket,

44
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,843
they sew it all together.

45
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,447
next step -- the windbreaker.

46
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,717
the outer fabric is heavy nylon.

47
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,119
the lining is a special fabric with tiny holes,

48
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,922
large enough to let humidity escape,

49
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,725
but small enough to stop water droplets

50
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,460
and wind from penetrating.

51
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,329
this is what will allow the jacket to breath,

52
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,797
while at the same time,

53
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,467
making it windproof and waterproof.

54
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,805
finally, it's time to put the two jacket components together.

55
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,074
using two separate strong threads,

56
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,943
they sew seams made of knotted stitches.

57
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,012
no seams go through the jacket

58
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,149
because that would break the insulation barrier

59
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,284
and let in cold air.

60
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,419
they join the two jackets together

61
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,889
only where they have to -- at the collar, the cuffs,

62
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,493
the hem, and along the zipper.

63
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,562
and this isn't any ordinary zipper.

64
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,632
it's made of corrosion-resistant nylon

65
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,033
with a nickel-plated slider

66
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,770
that lasts seven times longer than a normal slider.

67
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:03,108
until now, they've been sewing the jacket turned inside out.

68
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,478
now they turn it right-side in for finishing.

69
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,120
these heavy-duty snaps have sturdy grips

70
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,657
that anchor themselves between the fibers in the material

71
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,793
so they won't tear the fabric with repeated use.

72
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,602
some jackets have decorative embroidery.

73
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,106
designers use a computer program
to prepare the pattern.

74
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,312
the automatic machine embroiders
five jackets at once.

75
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:59,298
this intricate owl pattern takes 1 1/4 hours to complete.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,240
the final result is a stylish jacket

77
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,977
whose secret weapon is that hidden layer of insulation.

78
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,980
it traps air inside your body,

79
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,581
then heats it up,

80
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:21,019
creating a cushion of warmth against the cold of winter.

81
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,529
narrator: what is biophotonics?

82
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,531
well, bio is short for biology.

83
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,799
photonics is the physics of light.

84
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,469
biophotonics uses sophisticated imaging

85
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,072
and other sensitive optical instruments

86
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,941
to conduct biomedical research.

87
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,143
biophotonics has a range of uses

88
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,280
from medical diagnosis to drug screening.

89
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,088
in the golden years of animated film,

90
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,825
teams of animators would draw every single illustration

91
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,427
by hand.

92
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,897
today, they do much of their work by computer,

93
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,734
but that doesn't mean it's any less artistic.

94
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,438
it all starts with a screenplay --

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,041
a script containing not just dialogue,

96
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,110
but also physical descriptions of the characters

97
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,979
and background scenery.

98
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,649
the art director begins creating the characters.

99
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,952
he draws in pencil.

100
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:36,027
when he's finished, he traces the drawing in felt pen.

101
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,836
then he erases the pencil marks.

102
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,909
he adds shadowing to create relief.

103
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,947
once he's drawn all the characters,

104
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,916
he starts the backgrounds...

105
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,757
...and then the objects that appear in the backgrounds.

106
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,098
the storyboard artist blocks out the film on paper,

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,833
drawing by drawing.

108
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,701
the production team will follow this storyboard

109
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,271
the way a dressmaker follows a pattern.

110
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,714
they blow up the drawings, scan them into the computer,

111
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,383
then play them back in chronological order.

112
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,053
this creates what's called an "animatic" --

113
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,388
a two-dimensional version of the film,

114
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,123
minus the animation.

115
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,992
should the director now decide to change,

116
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,463
say, a ground-level view of the street to an aerial view,

117
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:48,533
he has the artist redraw the street from that new angle.

118
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,537
meanwhile, the animators work on
bringing the characters to life.

119
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,272
using specialized software,

120
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,942
they build a skeleton to fit inside the character's body.

121
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,744
when they move the skeleton,

122
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,613
the software makes the body move with it.

123
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,483
they make the characters three-dimensional

124
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,353
using a technique called wireframe animation.

125
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,289
first, they build the shape of the character

126
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,558
using a wire structure.

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,961
then they add color and clothing.

128
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,171
they further refine the character

129
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,906
by modifying facial features,

130
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,810
by adding texture, and by shadowing.

131
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,651
they use specialized software

132
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,522
to synchronize the character's mouth with the dialogue.

133
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,659
the technician works syllable by syllable,

134
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,928
picking the mouth movement that matches each sound.

135
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,666
it's a painstaking process that takes many months.

136
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,406
another animator applies the lighting effects.

137
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,476
lighting is as important in an animated cartoon

138
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,812
as it is in a movie with real people.

139
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,016
it creates relief, making everything look more realistic.

140
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,428
the animators cut and paste the characters and objects

141
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,364
onto the backgrounds.

142
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,966
with the characters' movements programmed into the computer,

143
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,169
the animators turn a two-dimensional

144
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,974
still version of the film into a three-dimensional animation,

145
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,144
essentially a rough cut of the film.

146
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,792
meanwhile, in the studio, the soundtrack takes shape.

147
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,261
actors record the characters' dialogue.

148
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,531
the sound technician weaves together the voices, the music,

149
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:04,402
and the sound effects using specially designed software.

150
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,675
they sync the soundtrack to the rough cut of the film.

151
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:15,547
then they refine the rough cut, playing with colors and textures

152
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,316
and smoothing out the characters' movements.

153
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:30,361
after a full year's work and more than 42,000 drawings,

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,433
this 24-minute computer-animated
film is finally finished.

155
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,978
narrator: have you ever dined on fungus?

156
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,914
well, if you've eaten mushrooms,
you have.

157
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,850
we like to think of those tasty

158
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,852
little umbrella-shaped things as vegetables,

159
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,655
but technically, they're fungi.

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,791
fungus omelette, anyone?

161
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,328
mushrooms grow in compost,

162
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,033
and preparing that compost is a science in itself.

163
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,869
it starts with horse manure and straw.

164
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,405
the correct balance of moisture
and air is critical,

165
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,008
because mushrooms need both to grow,

166
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,545
so mushroom farmers have to turn the pile frequently

167
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:24,348
to air it out, and they water it daily for about a week.

168
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,020
this kicks up plenty of chemical
and biological activity.

169
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,355
ammonia forms,

170
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,657
and microorganisms grow and reproduce,

171
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,426
releasing heat.

172
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,363
good compost requires a nitrogen content of about 2%,

173
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,233
so farmers add a nitrogen supplement --

174
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,568
chicken manure.

175
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,705
they also add gypsum --

176
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,641
a mineral that improves the structure of the compost

177
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,411
and neutralizes its acidity.

178
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,588
at the week to two-week mark,

179
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,457
depending on how the compost is progressing,

180
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,192
it goes into the composter,

181
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,262
which waters, aerates, and blends it.

182
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,531
the compost comes out chocolate brown,

183
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,266
smelling of ammonia.

184
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,801
next, they pasteurize it,

185
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,204
to kill off any insects or insect eggs.

186
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,476
they heat the compost at 136 degrees for eight hours,

187
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,745
then at 113 degrees for five days.

188
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,148
then, over several more days,

189
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,951
they gradually cool it to 77 degrees

190
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,553
as microorganisms turn the ammonia

191
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,956
into a nitrogen protein -- a mushroom nutrient.

192
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,092
the compost is finally ready.

193
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,895
the farmer sows grains of wheat

194
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,497
inoculated with mushroom mycelium --

195
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,100
fine threads of fungi that act as the mushrooms' roots.

196
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,105
a layer of soil and peat moss goes on top of the compost.

197
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,108
the mycelium draws water from the soil

198
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,777
and nutrients from the compost.

199
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,848
after about two weeks, tiny mushrooms begin to develop.

200
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,719
they grow fast, doubling their size every 24 hours,

201
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,054
and this in relative darkness.

202
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,524
green plants need sunlight for photosynthesis

203
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,860
but mushrooms don't.

204
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,464
what mushrooms do need is air,

205
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,467
because they breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.

206
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,337
green plants do the opposite.

207
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,908
another three days, and the tiny
mushrooms are fully grown

208
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,178
and ready for harvesting.

209
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,049
pickers have to be careful not to remove the roots

210
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,853
because left intact, they'll sprout a new batch of mushrooms

211
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,723
every three to five days for about three weeks.

212
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,861
they put the harvested mushrooms
in a refrigerator

213
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,931
just above freezing temperature,
for about a half-hour,

214
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,235
to stop the growing process.

215
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,207
on the packaging line, they weigh the mushrooms

216
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,210
and arrange them in a container,
buttons up.

217
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,421
a machine perforates the plastic covering

218
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,556
to let the mushrooms breathe.

219
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,659
this ensures a longer shelf life.

220
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,570
the mushrooms stay in a fridge

221
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,707
until they leave for the store the following day.

222
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,987
it's taken about 12 weeks

223
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,892
from the start of composting to your supermarket shelf.

224
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,070
narrator: gold jewelry has been
a symbol of wealth and status

225
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,672
throughout the ages.

226
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,341
today, though, it isn't just for the rich.

227
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,278
even ordinary people are likely to have a gold ring or necklace,

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,380
just a little less diamond-studded.

229
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,824
as early as 2,000 b.c.,

230
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,760
egyptian kings and queens adorned themselves

231
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:07,231
in golden jewelry encrusted with precious gems.

232
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,702
when the spanish sailed to the new world in 1492,

233
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:15,105
they discovered mayan and aztec
masterpieces of colored stones

234
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,042
and pure gold.

235
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,446
today, elaborate gold jewelry and precious gems

236
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,782
are well beyond the reach of the average person,

237
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,185
except for the diamond ring --

238
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,655
still the customary symbol of engagements.

239
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,663
the client and the jewelry designer

240
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,666
first decide how the ring will look.

241
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,202
the designer then measures the client's finger

242
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,605
to determine her ring size.

243
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,075
he then sketches out the design
they've agreed upon --

244
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,411
a grooved band with three diamonds.

245
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:57,148
the model maker works with a special carving wax.

246
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,483
using a compass,

247
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,953
he measures and marks the width of the band,

248
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,756
then carefully saws it off.

249
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,691
he takes his gauge

250
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,094
and puts it on a stick with ring-size markings,

251
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,695
called a mandrel.

252
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,032
he adjusts his compass to the ring size,

253
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,169
then scores the finger hole on the block of wax.

254
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,171
he then takes his drill

255
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,940
and carefully carves out the hole he scored.

256
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,782
then he grinds off the wax on the outside of the band.

257
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,253
using the compass again, he scores the middle of the band,

258
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,920
where he'll make the groove.

259
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:40,257
then, using a fine drill bit, he carves out the groove.

260
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,127
with a file, he then refines the groove

261
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,596
and shapes the curves of the ring

262
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,331
according to the design.

263
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,203
after putting wax prongs on the band,

264
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,472
he attaches a wax stem to the model.

265
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,741
he then positions the stem into the base of the cylinder

266
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,679
that the jeweler will use to cast the ring.

267
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,615
the base goes onto the platform
of a vacuum machine.

268
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,351
the jeweler puts a cylinder on top of the base,

269
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,554
then pours in a special plaster.

270
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,225
the vacuum sucks all the air out of the plaster.

271
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,960
this is a key part of the process,

272
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,762
because if any air bubbles remain,

273
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,032
the finished ring will be out of shape.

274
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,435
in less than a minute, the vacuuming is done,

275
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,637
and the cylinder goes into the furnace

276
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,207
at 1,350 degrees fahrenheit.

277
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,776
the wax model evaporates,

278
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,512
leaving a void the exact shape of the ring

279
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,981
in the hardened plaster.

280
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,917
next, they melt the gold.

281
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,854
the gold content of jewelry is measured by karat.

282
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,858
the lower the karat, the less gold and the more alloy,

283
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,394
or cheaper metals such as nickel, silver, and copper.

284
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,396
after five hours,

285
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,498
the cylinder comes out of the furnace

286
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,434
and goes into the casting machine.

287
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,806
the machine spins for about a minute.

288
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,942
the centrifugal force shoots the liquefied gold

289
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,346
into the plaster mold that's inside the cylinder.

290
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,755
the jeweler then immerses the cylinder in cold water.

291
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,159
this cools the gold and makes the plaster disintegrate.

292
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:25,028
what's left is the cast gold ring,

293
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,034
but its surface is rough, so on to the finishing process.

294
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:33,571
the jeweler saws off the stem and gets to work.

295
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,608
he files and grinds the ring until the surface is smooth.

296
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,885
then he stamps on his trademark
and the karat marking.

297
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,591
then he hammers the ring on the mandrel

298
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,259
to make it perfectly round.

299
00:19:55,261 --> 00:20:00,398
the jeweler then hands it off to a specialist in polishing.

300
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
the polisher runs the ring against a series

301
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,604
of buffing wheels until it's bright and shiny.

302
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,472
the polisher then hands it off

303
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,741
to a specialist in setting gemstones.

304
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,610
the setter straightens the prongs

305
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,011
that'll hold the diamonds.

306
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,681
then, with a delicate drill bit,

307
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:20,084
he carefully carves out the inside of the prongs.

308
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:24,155
the edges of the diamonds will fit directly into these slots.

309
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,494
he readjusts the prongs, then sets the diamonds,

310
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,431
making sure the prongs hold them down securely.

311
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,836
that's a 1-carat diamond in the middle,

312
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,506
a 1/2-carat diamond on each side.

313
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,709
the jeweler then immerses the finished ring

314
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,177
into the ultrasonic machine.

315
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,580
the vibrations in the water penetrate every nook and cranny,

316
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,982
washing the ring.

317
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,253
finally, he puts the ring under a jet of hot steam

318
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,923
to blast away any remaining residue.

319
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,791
and voilà.

320
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:04,328
with a ring like that, who wouldn't say "i do"?

321
