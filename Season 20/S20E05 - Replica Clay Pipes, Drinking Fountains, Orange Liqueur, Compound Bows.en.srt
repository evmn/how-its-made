            narrator:           
clay tobacco pipes may have been
  the first disposable product. 

4
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,325
     for centuries, smokers     
   in north america and europe  

5
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,329
   used them until they broke,  
      which happened often.     

6
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,565
         clay pipes fell        
      out of widespread use     

7
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:09,068
 at the end of the 19th century,
  but they're still made today  

8
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,071
         by clay artists        
  with a reverence for history. 

9
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,144
 nostalgia is a new niche market
         for clay pipes,        

10
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,413
             popular            
   at historical reenactments   

11
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,947
    and coveted by collectors   

12
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:26,352
      because history buffs     
     like an authentic puff.    

13
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:28,620
 at this studio in the midwest, 

14
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:34,226
      the craftsman starts      
    with a small wad of clay.   

15
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,164
    he rolls it long and thin   
and flares the shape at the end.

16
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,568
this establishes the basic shape

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,640
   of a native-american-style   
           clay pipe.           

18
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:51,444
    he drives a tapered stick   
 into it to hollow the long stem

19
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:55,514
      and stops just short      
       of the flared end.       

20
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,249
           he rolls it          
      with the stick inside     

21
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,785
         as he continues        
       to shape the clay.       

22
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,920
     he trims the flared end    

23
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,323
      and now transforms it     
       into the pipe bowl.      

24
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,131
he presses a handmade stone tool
    into it to make it hollow   

25
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,666
    and then flares the bowl    
           some more.           

26
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,336
        to better define        
     the shape of the bowl,     

27
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:22,008
       he kneads the clay       
       from the outside.        

28
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,747
 he removes the stone implement.

29
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,349
   he now works the pipe bowl   
        entirely by hand        

30
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,954
    to make the thickness of    
 the wall a little more uniform.

31
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:38,491
     one more roll, and then    
  he punctures the bowl cavity  

32
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,160
 to link it to the air passage. 

33
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,032
    he bends the bowl upward    

34
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:50,503
    and then sculpts the clay   
         a little more.         

35
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,305
 he sets it aside to dry a bit. 

36
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,973
        the clay hardens        

37
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,975
    but is still soft enough    
          to carve into         

38
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,379
  with the edge of a wood tool. 

39
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,115
        to create notches       
      and other trim marks,     

40
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:06,052
   he gently presses the tool   
         into the bowl.         

41
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:11,256
       he tweaks the shape      
          a little more         

42
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:15,060
   and leaves the pipe to dry   
        much longer now.        

43
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,831
    the moisture evaporates,    
    and the clay solidifies.    

44
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,469
    using another stone tool,   

45
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,106
       he grinds off bumps      
    and other surface flaws.    

46
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,611
       the grinding leaves      
  little scratches on the pipe. 

47
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:37,483
 he rubs those away with water. 

48
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:41,220
    the clay quickly absorbs    
   the small amounts of water,  

49
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:45,023
   and the surface of the pipe  
   dries in a very short time.  

50
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:50,696
    after that, this replica    
native pipe looks pretty smooth.

51
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,232
       other native pipes       
       are more elaborate.      

52
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,969
  the bowls are decorated with  
 effigies of an animal or human.

53
00:03:56,971 --> 00:04:00,772
    here, the artist sculpts    
   a man's face onto the bowl.  

54
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,975
      he uses a blunt stick     

55
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,479
  to raise a couple of eyebrows 
        and add nostrils.       

56
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,718
  he rolls eyeballs and plants  
     some ears on the side.     

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,589
          the pipe bowl         
    will serve as the mouth.    

58
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,590
      native people believe     

59
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,127
that smoke carries their prayers
          to the gods.          

60
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,063
 to make an english tavern pipe,

61
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:27,266
  he shapes the clay in a mold  
    with a metal wire inside    

62
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,268
    to create an air channel.   

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,203
    he trims the excess clay.   

64
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,740
   he stamps the maker's mark   
   onto the base of the pipe.   

65
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:38,410
   after his removes the wire   
  used to make the air channel, 

66
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,479
      there's drying time,      
 and then he fires it in a kiln 

67
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,551
        at approximately        
    2,012 degrees fahrenheit.   

68
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:50,890
  after 17 hours, each pipe is  
 a solid piece of white ceramic.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,028
    he fires the native pipes   
    outside in the open air.    

70
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,099
  he builds a fire around them  
 using bark, leaves, and twigs. 

71
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,901
   this is the traditional way  

72
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:04,970
      natives have hardened     
      their ceramic items.      

73
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,838
       as the fire burns,       

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,244
  the clay hardens and takes on 
     a smoky, black finish.     

75
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,645
       the fire dies down,      

76
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,515
         and he removes         
  the now-hardened clay pipes.  

77
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,187
           still hot,           
   he removes them with tongs   

78
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,458
  and sets them aside to cool.  

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,129
later, in the studio, he dampens
    a cloth with mineral oil    

80
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,865
   and rubs it into the clay.   

81
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:36,802
     this seals it and gives    
 the sooty finish a nice patina.

82
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,605
     it takes the craftsman     
        about three days        

83
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,274
           to make one          
  of these replica clay pipes.  

84
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:46,011
     they're sure to provide    
      a whiff of nostalgia.     

85
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,498
    narrator: there's nothing   
    quite as thirst-quenching   

86
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,501
  as a sip at a water fountain  
   after playing in the park.   

87
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:13,772
  the modern drinking fountain  
 was invented in the early 1900s

88
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,109
      as a result of health     
    and sanitation concerns.    

89
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,846
             today,             
  it's a safe source of water.  

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,388
       it waits to serve,       
   no matter what the weather.  

91
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,789
  and at the touch of a button, 

92
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,393
          you can drink         
 your fill of refreshing water. 

93
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,929
      essentially unchanged     
          for decades,          

94
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:40,666
    it is the ever-dependable   
       drinking fountain.       

95
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,202
         a worker begins        
  by coating the concrete molds 

96
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,870
      with a release agent.     

97
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,274
       the molds are made       
    of fiber glass and metal.   

98
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,476
          he makes sure         
     the coating is thorough    

99
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,513
so that the molds will be easier
     to pull apart later on.    

100
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,619
   with a cloth, he also coats  
 the rubberized cap of the mold.

101
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:05,824
 the cap will eventually become 
    the top of the fountain.    

102
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,893
  after he applies the coating, 

103
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,496
      the worker assembles      
 the inset portion of the mold. 

104
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,566
he then puts the fountain frame,
 made of galvanized steel rods, 

105
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,036
           into place.          

106
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,371
          he assembles          
    the two sides of the mold   

107
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,107
     with the fountain frame    
        enclosed within.        

108
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,375
      using nuts and bolts,     

109
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,910
           he ensures           
   the mold is nice and tight   

110
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,313
       to avoid seam lines      
        in the concrete.        

111
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,517
  he now inverts the assembled  
     mold on top of the cap,    

112
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,787
        again making sure       
   all the pieces of the mold   

113
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,389
    are as snug as possible.    

114
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,990
      using wooden spacers,     

115
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:43,328
 the worker makes sure the frame
  inside is precisely centered. 

116
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,864
           he slips in          
      the core of the mold,     

117
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,867
   which will create the void   
  needed for mounting hardware. 

118
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,470
        this wooden cover       
   will keep the concrete out.  

119
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,608
    a mixing machine prepares   
   the concrete-aggregate mix.  

120
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,143
a computer controls the portions

121
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:03,482
    of sand, rocks, pebbles,    
 and water used in this recipe. 

122
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,016
 once the employee is satisfied 

123
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,018
      with the consistency      
         of the mixture,        

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,655
          he directs it         
       into a wheelbarrow.      

125
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,227
  as the worker pours concrete  
         into the mold,         

126
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,198
    the mixture oozes evenly    
    into the available space.   

127
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,707
     he completely fills it     
     in a matter of minutes.    

128
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:34,380
        he uses a trowel        
      to smooth the edges.      

129
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,980
    two to three hours later,   

130
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,918
 workers carefully pull the core
         from the mold.         

131
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,121
         once the cement        
      has cured overnight,      

132
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,124
          workers lift          
     the top of the mold off    

133
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,925
     and peel away its cap,     

134
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:50,996
revealing the top of a brand-new
       drinking fountain.       

135
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,799
      with a rubber mallet,     
      the worker separates      

136
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:58,137
      the sides of the mold     
   from the concrete fountain.  

137
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,673
 the fountain pedestal is still 
a little rough around the edges,

138
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,410
         so he gives it         
   a high-pressure water wash.  

139
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,145
   the spray gradually removes  

140
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,548
      the superficial layer     
          of concrete,          

141
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,119
revealing the textured concrete-
    aggregate mix underneath.   

142
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,562
 the concrete aggregate becomes 
       a sturdy material,       

143
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,965
  with sand, rocks, and pebbles 
    not just on its surface,    

144
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,234
    but all the way through.    

145
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:34,372
 the aggregate mix is durable,  
 with no rust or peeling paint. 

146
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,574
  it's aesthetically versatile  

147
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,712
            and comes           
     in a variety of colors.    

148
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,515
     a worker now assembles     
          the plumbing.         

149
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,919
      he places two washers     
 on this lead-free brass fitting

150
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,588
  and applies a thread sealant. 

151
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,791
  he holds the bubbler in place 
   on the stainless steel bowl  

152
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:57,395
     and attaches a fitting     
           underneath.          

153
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:00,465
 he applies more thread sealant 
      to the elbow fitting      

154
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,333
 and, after putting it in place,

155
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,071
           makes sure           
     it's carefully aligned.    

156
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,541
         he then inserts        
    a stainless steel drain,    

157
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,077
  followed by a washer and nut  
      to hold it in place.      

158
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,218
 he attaches a mounting bracket 
    to hold the bowl assembly   

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,425
          to the frame          
  inside the concrete fountain. 

160
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,429
        a worker now fits       
        the bowl assembly       

161
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,967
          into the top          
    of the fountain pedestal.   

162
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,902
      the mounting bracket      
          holds firmly          

163
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,971
to ridges in the concrete frame.

164
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,841
        a worker attaches       
      the button assembly,      

165
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,376
   which holds both the button  

166
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,578
          and the valve         
     controlling water flow.    

167
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,382
  he attaches the elbow fitting 
     to polypropylene tubing    

168
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,851
  and attaches the button plate 
    to the fountain pedestal.   

169
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,186
     a slide on the pedestal    

170
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,524
      prevents the bubbler      
  from being twisted or turned. 

171
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:01,994
     all that's needed now      
     is a thirsty customer.     

172
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,208
  narrator: tradition dictates  
       that orange liqueur      

173
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,812
    be served as a digestif,    
   but nowadays it's also used  

174
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,815
        as an ingredient        
     in popular cocktails --    

175
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,552
for instance, mixed with tequila
      to make a margarita,      

176
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,621
 with gin to make a white lady, 

177
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:33,125
          or with vodka         
     to make a cosmopolitan.    

178
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,966
         orange liqueur         
  is also known as triple sec,  

179
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:44,903
  triple referring to the fact  
  it's distilled three times.   

180
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,638
   "sec" is french for "dry."   

181
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,374
      however, this liqueur     
        isn't dry at all.       

182
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,109
    it's actually very sweet,   

183
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,913
      even though it's made     
   with mostly bitter oranges.  

184
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,418
 triple sec was invented in 1834
  by this distillery in france. 

185
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,986
       the liqueur is made      

186
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,588
       from a combination       
      of sweet orange rinds     

187
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,258
    and bitter orange rinds,    
        which are green,        

188
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,927
      imported from haiti.      

189
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,129
   the rinds arrive sun-dried,  

190
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,264
        so the first step       
      is to rehydrate them      

191
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:20,071
    by soaking in cold water    
       for about 12 hours.      

192
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,740
          the next step         
 is running each and every rind 

193
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,811
    through a revolving razor   
   to remove the white lining.  

194
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,681
 left on, this lining would make
    the liqueur taste bitter.   

195
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:39,357
  rind with its lining removed  
     is referred to as zest.    

196
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,226
      while the distillery      
          will divulge          

197
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,094
     that its liqueur recipe    
            calls for           

198
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,163
       significantly more       
       bitter orange zest       

199
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:50,836
     than sweet orange zest,    
the precise ratio is top secret.

200
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,639
          the next step         
 is what's known as maceration. 

201
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,776
they soak the zest in sugar beet
  alcohol for about five days,  

202
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,380
        during which time       
        the rinds soften        

203
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:05,983
         and the alcohol        
     turns slightly orange.     

204
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,186
           at the end           
    of the maceration phase,    

205
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,788
      they pump the alcohol     
      and transfer the zest     

206
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,559
into a long-necked copper vessel
         called a still.        

207
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,800
  once all the alcohol and zest 
           are inside,          

208
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,136
    they close up the still.    

209
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:30,141
  then they release hot steam,  
     which heats the still,     

210
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,811
 bringing the alcohol to a boil.

211
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,481
     the alcohol evaporates,    
rising up the still's long neck,

212
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,217
        until it reaches        
      a condensation system     

213
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,352
         which cools it         
      to liquid form again      

214
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,623
             but now            
with a more concentrated flavor.

215
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,761
 this entire distillation cycle 
    takes about a half hour.    

216
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:53,164
     the result is a spirit     
   of bitter and sweet oranges  

217
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:58,303
    that has an alcohol level   
     of between 86% and 88%.    

218
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:02,574
the first flow out of the still,
  called head phlegm, is white, 

219
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:06,978
      due to the orange oil     
   which has risen to the top.  

220
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,248
    once that oil flows off,    
       the spirit is clear      

221
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,384
      and ready for another     
   distillation the next day,   

222
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:18,990
  then another the day after -- 
   three distillations in all.  

223
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,193
 the final spirit, called heart,

224
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,930
    now has an alcohol level    
         of 81% to 83%.         

225
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:29,868
 they pour a precise amount into
  a stainless steel mixing vat. 

226
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,737
      in a different mixer,     
  they combine water and sugar, 

227
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:36,475
  heating until the ingredients 
     concentrate into syrup.    

228
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,943
     then they add the syrup    
         to the spirit.         

229
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:43,815
 the proportions are top secret 
 and mix for at least an hour.  

230
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,951
   the syrup gives the liqueur  
      additional sweetness      

231
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:51,656
   and dilutes the 80% alcohol  
      level in half to 40%.     

232
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,894
       in the distillery's      
   quality-control laboratory,  

233
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,698
    technicians test samples    
       regularly to ensure      

234
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,635
that the liqueur's alcohol level
      is always consistent.     

235
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,307
      on the bottling line,     

236
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,776
        the first station       
      is a rinsing machine.     

237
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,913
   it disinfects the interior   
  of the frosted-glass bottles  

238
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,784
          with alcohol.         

239
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:22,187
    next, the bottles proceed   
     to the filling station.    

240
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,523
  these are 1 1/2-pint bottles. 

241
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,660
 however, the liqueur is bottled
   in several different sizes.  

242
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,400
     the next station places    
      a metallic twist cap      

243
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,403
          onto the neck         
     of each filled bottle,     

244
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:43,074
 then twists it until the bottle
       is tightly sealed.       

245
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,756
        the final station       
     simultaneously applies     

246
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:01,826
 front and back adhesive labels.

247
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,163
   triple sec is a completely   
      colorless liqueur --      

248
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,032
   not what some might expect,  

249
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,902
  given its unmistakably orange 
             flavor.            

250
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,053
            narrator:           
   the bow and arrow have come  
 a long way since the stone age.

251
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:33,057
    in the 1960s, an american   
 engineer added cams and cables 

252
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,595
  to produce what is now known  
      as the compound bow.      

253
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,531
          concept-wise,         
     he hit the bull's-eye.     

254
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:43,835
       with this new bow,       
archery entered a whole new era.

255
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,476
      the compound bow puts     
 greater energy behind the arrow

256
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,611
           so it flies          
     faster and straighter.     

257
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,314
   this means it's more likely  
        to hit the mark.        

258
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,486
            it starts           
  with this computerized tool.  

259
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,622
     it carves a latticework    
     of holes in the riser,     

260
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,757
which is the aluminum framework.

261
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,628
            the holes           
 lighten the bow substantially. 

262
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,763
    next, a printing cylinder   
      applies an activator      

263
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,566
     to release ink graphics    
    from a starch-based film.   

264
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,836
         the film rolls         
      into a tub of water.      

265
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,705
       the film dissolves,      

266
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,775
    and the camouflage-style    
    graphics are now afloat.    

267
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,111
  machinery dips the bow risers 
   into the floating artwork,   

268
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,448
and the graphics adhere to them.

269
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,585
 a camouflage design now covers 
       the entire surface,      

270
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,654
   including all the crevices.  

271
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,189
      after a wash and dry,     

272
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,394
     the risers are sprayed     
  with a clear acrylic coating. 

273
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:47,399
  in the meantime, a technician 
 prepares 10 bowstrings at once.

274
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,135
    each string will be made    
    of 20 synthetic strands.    

275
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:55,006
       he ties the fibers       
    to the prongs of a wheel,   

276
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:59,010
    and as it turns, it winds   
 the 20 fibers into one bundle. 

277
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,146
    the result is a bowstring   
        that's so strong,       

278
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,216
 it won't stretch under tension.

279
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,419
 next, the string builder wraps 
      one of the bowstrings     

280
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,021
   around the posts of a jig.   

281
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:15,159
 he winds a thin, braided string
   around a strategic section   

282
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,561
        to reinforce it.        

283
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,897
     this is called serving.    

284
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,835
       he closes the jig        
       to loop the string       

285
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,038
   at the reinforced juncture.  

286
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,441
     this loop will be used     
  to tightly attach the string  

287
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,979
       to the pulley wheel      
        known as the cam.       

288
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,451
   he loops the other end now   

289
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,253
     and spins the synthetic    
       string wrap further      

290
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:46,524
  to provide extra protection.  

291
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,261
      he stops at the point     
    where the arrow will sit    

292
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,797
       prior to shooting.       

293
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,199
    he pulls the string apart   

294
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,001
       and inserts the end      
     of more serving string.    

295
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:00,204
  he winds it around this site  
    to bolster the bowstring    

296
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,873
        at this location.       

297
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,343
he burns off the end to seal it.

298
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,079
         he ties a loop         
 around the reinforced section. 

299
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,348
          this is known         
     as the shooter's loop.     

300
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,820
         it will be used        
   to nock or hold the arrow.   

301
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,756
       to keep the string       
   from oscillating when drawn  

302
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,758
and ensure a quiet, steady shot,

303
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,427
          they install          
      two rubber dampeners.     

304
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,431
    a machine pulls both ends   
          of the string         

305
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:31,302
      through the dampeners     
  to slide them into position.  

306
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,439
   the riser is now finished,   
     so they add the handle,    

307
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,643
 string stop for more dampening,
       and the arrow rest.      

308
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:43,515
 it's time to give the compound 
bow that all-important leverage.

309
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,852
    he screws a limb and cam    
    to each end of the riser.   

310
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,389
    a device presses the bow    
        to load tension.        

311
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,728
      he slips the end loop     
       around the cam post      

312
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,031
      and winds the string      
      around the cam track.     

313
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,203
       he pulls the string      
 to the other cam and winds it. 

314
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:15,947
     he then turns the cams     
     to tighten the string.     

315
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,750
        finally, he runs        
     two cables to the cams,    

316
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:22,554
    completing the mechanics    
      of the compound bow.      

317
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,963
     he splits the bowstring    
   at a predetermined location  

318
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,364
     and inserts an aperture    

319
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:37,368
    through which the archer    
      can view the target.      

320
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,637
          he now frees          
     the bow from the press     

321
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,507
 and locates the shooter's loop 
         more precisely         

322
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,176
 with a special measuring stick.

323
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:53,651
satisfied with the placement, he
tightens the loop to the string.

324
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,454
 he winds more synthetic string 
       around the aperture      

325
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,924
          to secure it.         

326
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,128
 he burns the end of the string 
        down to the knot        

327
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,896
     to prevent unraveling.     

328
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,535
        at this factory,        
  they produce one compound bow 

329
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,338
      every three minutes.      

330
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,040
with production targets now met,

331
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:20,145
  it's time to aim for success  
     at the shooting range.     

332
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,024
