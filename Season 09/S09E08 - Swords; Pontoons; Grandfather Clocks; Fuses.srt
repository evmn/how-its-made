        narrator: swords.       

4
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,633
            pontoons.           

5
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,905
       grandfather clocks.      

6
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,744
           and fuses.           

7
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:58,524
  for thousands of years, wars  
 were won and lost by the sword.

8
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,026
  swords helped shape history.  

9
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,065
  today, modern artisans craft  
       historical replicas      

10
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,600
    of these age-old weapons,   

11
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,504
and they go to the hilt to make 
sure the details are just right.

12
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,147
        this reproduction       
       of a medieval sword      

13
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,617
    hearkens back to the days   
  of knights in shining armor.  

14
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,555
the first step to making a sword

15
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,959
     is to place a piece of     
 high-carbon steel in a fixture.

16
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,096
computer-guided blades carve out
  the basic shape of the sword  

17
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,433
   with all the specifications  
        of the original.        

18
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,968
         centuries ago,         

19
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,904
  a blacksmith would have done  
  this painstaking job by hand, 

20
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,173
 but this machine is much faster

21
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,176
           and creates          
   a much more consistent cut.  

22
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,517
 after about an hour of carving,

23
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,121
        a nicely tapered        
      sword blank emerges.      

24
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,466
     the blank is submerged     
     in hot liquid salt --      

25
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,202
         a critical step        
     that softens the steel     

26
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,272
      to eliminate stresses     
     created by the carving.    

27
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,277
         next, the blade        
   is plunged into cool liquid  

28
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,412
 in a process called quenching. 

29
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,749
     it immediately hardens     
     the edges of the sword,    

30
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,084
         but the center         
       cools more slowly.       

31
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,020
     this allows the sword      
     to retain flexibility,     

32
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,423
        giving the blade        
       a springy quality.       

33
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,360
      using a belt grinder,     

34
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,096
     sword makers fine-tune     
        the blade's shape       

35
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,965
       and hone its edges.      

36
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,839
        the blade is now        
        incredibly sharp.       

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,244
   to test its strength, they   
 strike a metal barrel with it. 

38
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,848
           incredibly,          
     the sword doesn't chip.    

39
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,983
 next, wax is pumped into molds 

40
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:09,787
  to make historically accurate 
    copies of the hilt parts    

41
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,189
       like the pommel --       

42
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,327
   which is the counterweight   
   at the end of the hilt --    

43
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,930
  and the guard that separates  
   the blade from the handle.   

44
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,600
    these wax copies are used   
   to cast the parts in metal.  

45
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,305
   then the cast-metal pieces   
   are smoothed and polished.   

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,411
they smooth away the rough edges
       on this sword guard      

47
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,614
      and hone its profile.     

48
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,885
       grinding the pommel      
         is a challenge,        

49
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,821
  because it has so many curves 
           and angles.          

50
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,556
   one mistake, and the pommel  
     could end up lopsided,     

51
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,827
 which means it wouldn't be very
  effective as a counterweight. 

52
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,970
with the blade in a padded vise,
the guard slides onto the tang, 

53
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,673
      where it's cushioned      
     with a piece of plastic    

54
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,708
        and a metal pipe.       

55
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,646
       then a sledgehammer      
    pounds it into position.    

56
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:19,291
        next, the pommel        
     is hammered into place.    

57
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,796
   and finally, a small piece   
  of steel called a peen block  

58
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,832
         is slipped on.         

59
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,401
        heat from a torch       
        softens the peen        

60
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,937
          so it spreads         
     as it's hammered down.     

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
  the epoxy gets a quick stir.  

62
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,948
        then it's applied       
       to two wooden grips      

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,318
    as well as to the handle    
          of the sword.         

64
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,690
         then the grips         
     are clamped into place.    

65
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,632
   next, black dye is brushed   
  onto a thin piece of leather. 

66
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,268
         the other side         
      is coated with glue.      

67
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,039
   this glue-and-dye-drenched   
             leather            

68
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,409
     is then wrapped around     
       the wooden handle.       

69
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,217
it's bound with cord to compress
the leather wrap while it dries.

70
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,192
now it's time to brand the blade
   with the maker's insignia.   

71
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:32,564
  chemicals etch the mark into  
  the steel .4 of an inch deep. 

72
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,006
   and now you have a replica   

73
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,675
           that's true          
   to the medieval original --  

74
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,346
  a piece of art that takes you 
   back in time at swordpoint.  

75
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,521
   coming up, putting together  
  the pieces of a pontoon boat. 

76
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,161
     narrator: party barge,     
 floating bridge, luxury raft --

77
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,098
 just some of the many functions
        of pontoon boats.       

78
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,568
 while their basic design hasn't
  changed much over the years,  

79
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,238
new materials have made pontoons
   bigger, sleeker, sturdier,   

80
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,639
           and faster.          

81
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,410
  and what better way to enjoy  
 an afternoon than on the lake. 

82
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,513
        in the old days,        

83
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:25,250
     pontoons floated atop      
     45-gallon steel drums.     

84
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,455
       today, they ride on      
 custom-built floating chambers 

85
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,457
 made of special aluminum alloy.

86
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,529
     these floating chambers    
start off as sheets of aluminum.

87
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,333
      this rolling machine      
     forms them into tubes,     

88
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,005
  applying pressure equivalent  
 to the weight of 26 elephants. 

89
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,942
  a worker slides each cylinder 
          onto a track          

90
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,344
  to stabilize it for welding.  

91
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,081
   a pacing machine regulates   
 the speed of the welding torch 

92
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,683
       so that it connects      
    the tube's edges evenly,    

93
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,819
       producing a solid,       
        watertight seal.        

94
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,893
 meanwhile, this rolling machine
     shapes aluminum sheets     

95
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,629
     into tapered cylinders     
       called nose cones.       

96
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,431
           by varying           
     the hydraulic pressure,    

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,367
          the operator          
  is able to mold the aluminum  

98
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,170
 into the shape of a large cone.

99
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,305
            they use            
    a special aluminum alloy    

100
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,573
to make the chambers shockproof.

101
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:27,112
           next step,           
 making this pontoon leakproof. 

102
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,385
    first, the welder clamps    
  the nose cone seams together  

103
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,454
     to prepare for welding.    

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,656
  because of its unique shape,  

105
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,394
 the nose cone has to be welded 
       completely by hand.      

106
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,996
      this type of welding,     
       called tig welding,      

107
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:50,201
 generates temperatures that can
 reach 9,000 degrees fahrenheit.

108
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,804
         the nose cones         
will sit at the bow of the boat,

109
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,340
           in front of          
  the other floating chambers.  

110
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,676
      the waffled component     
   at the end of each chamber   

111
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,744
      is called the baffle.     

112
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:04,149
    it adds extra protection    
         against leaks.         

113
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,351
      this hydraulic press      
 squeezes the sections together 

114
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,420
     for an extra-snug fit.     

115
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,625
  chambers are welded together  
         to form floats.        

116
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,628
          the number of         
    chambers per float varies   

117
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,697
          depending on          
      the pontoon's length.     

118
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,234
     these risers will hold     
  the pontoon's floor in place. 

119
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,370
 each chamber floats on its own,

120
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:29,407
 so even with several punctures,
   the boat would stay afloat.  

121
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,248
 a worker shoots compressed air 
        into each chamber       

122
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,884
       to check for leaks.      

123
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,723
       he coats the welds       
     with a soapy solution,     

124
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,859
      which will bubble up      
   in the case of an air leak.  

125
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,327
    this demonstration shows    

126
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,996
     that if air can get<i> out</i>    
     through this tiny hole,    

127
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,333
      then water can get<i> in</i>     
           through it.          

128
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,736
         workers install        
     aluminum cross members     

129
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,473
   to support all the weight    
   that will be added on top.   

130
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,208
    a pneumatic torque wrench   
             is used            

131
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,946
 to bolt the cross members into 
 the risers with rustproof nuts.

132
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,548
     next, the boat's floor     
         is constructed         

133
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,485
           from sheets          
  of pressure-treated plywood.  

134
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:18,356
  pop rivets anchor it securely 
      to the cross members.     

135
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,826
   workers custom-cut and glue  
      down a marine carpet.     

136
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,294
      it's made of plastic,     

137
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,198
   so even with a lot of water  
  exposure, it still won't rot. 

138
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,435
          now for some          
     fade-resistant decals.     

139
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,304
          rollers crimp         
 the boat's aluminum side panels

140
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,772
     to make them stronger.     

141
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:39,177
  corrugated panels don't warp  
 or wobble as much as flat ones.

142
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,912
     using a pop-rivet gun,     

143
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,849
   a worker fastens the panels  
        onto the railing.       

144
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,920
this shaping machine curves the 
railing in all the right places,

145
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,057
   bending the malleable metal  
     with varying pressure.     

146
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,797
          next, workers         
   bring the assembled pieces   

147
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,633
        to the platform.        

148
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,007
     screws and bolts secure    
 everything to the boat's floor,

149
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,009
    including the furniture.    

150
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,280
     the pontoon's captain      
     will command the craft     

151
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,648
       using this console.      

152
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,022
    the buttons for the horn,   
        lights, and music       

153
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,425
  sit at the top of the console 
        for easy access.        

154
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,832
 extra touches bring some of the
 comforts of home to this craft.

155
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,237
    wires and control cables    
  connect the captain's console 

156
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,573
  to this 50-horsepower motor.  

157
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,976
        it's by no means        
      a high-speed engine,      

158
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,912
   but it gives a pontoon boat  
     all the power it needs     

159
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,748
      for a leisurely spin      
          on the lake.          

160
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,260
 when we return, clocking in at 
 a factory where time is money. 

161
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,532
            narrator:           
     invented centuries ago,    

162
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,267
       grandfather clocks       
         run on gravity.        

163
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,937
when you wind the clock, weights
    inside are drawn upwards.   

164
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,006
 gravity then pulls the weights 
         down gradually,        

165
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,610
    unwinding the cables and    
 turning the hands of the clock.

166
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,614
the proper term for this type of
timepiece is a long-case clock. 

167
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,316
         [ clock dings ]        

168
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,020
the nickname "grandfather clock"

169
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,223
    came from a popular song    
         from the 1800s.        

170
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,164
  this long-established company 

171
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,966
      makes its clock cases     
    out of quality hardwoods,   

172
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,869
     such as maple and oak.     

173
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,906
       to construct frames      
  for the four sides and door,  

174
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,841
 workers fit dowels into holes, 

175
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,311
 then secure the pieces together
      with screws and glue.     

176
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,046
       they lay each frame      
     in this curing machine     

177
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,450
    that uses high-frequency    
  radio waves to generate heat, 

178
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,054
   drying the glue in seconds.  

179
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,724
 workers connect the four frames
      with screws and glue.     

180
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,328
      they'll later attach      
   the doorframe with hinges.   

181
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,401
          the next step         
    is to assemble a base --    

182
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,938
    again, with dowels, glue,   
           and screws.          

183
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,743
      once the glue is dry,     

184
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,179
       the assembled frame      
       goes into the base.      

185
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,086
   now for some embellishment.  

186
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,556
     computer-guided routers    
   carve elegant wood moldings  

187
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,427
 that give this particular model
       a traditional feel.      

188
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,731
 today's grandfather clocks come
  in styles to suit any decor.  

189
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,636
     workers carefully sand     

190
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,239
   every single piece of wood   
       in the clock case.       

191
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,373
           the surface          
    must be flawlessly smooth   

192
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,177
 for it to absorb color evenly. 

193
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:03,281
 the moldings are attached with 
a combination of glue and nails.

194
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,291
    these long pieces of wood   
 become curved, fluted moldings.

195
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,931
       they adorn the side      
        of the doorframe.       

196
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,868
    this model also features    
    a pair of stately columns   

197
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,071
   above and below the flutes.  

198
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,540
         a worker first         
    positions them with glue,   

199
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:34,412
    then screws them securely   
   into the frame from behind.  

200
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,214
          the next step         
      is to stain the wood,     

201
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,151
         hand-rubbing it        
     to bring out the grain.    

202
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,886
        a coat of lacquer       
        protects the wood       

203
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,290
 and gives it a degree of sheen,
      from matte to glossy,     

204
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,691
     depending on the model.    

205
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,160
        after installing        
       the glass and door,      

206
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,896
      it's time to install      
     the clock's components.    

207
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,431
    workers start with long,    
  metal bars called chime rods, 

208
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,835
        8 to 12 of them,        
     depending on the model.    

209
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:00,137
     each chime rod produces    
a certain different musical note

210
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,372
          when struck.          

211
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,242
     next comes a mechanism     
      called the movement.      

212
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,377
           it contains          
     timekeeping components     

213
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,380
 that trigger the chime hammers 
      to hit the chime rods     

214
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,583
     on the hour, half-hour,    
        or quarter-hour.        

215
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,453
          this company          
     uses only top-quality,     

216
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,656
       all-brass movements      
     imported from germany.     

217
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,793
        the chime hammers       
     are also made of brass,    

218
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,861
   but they have plastic tips,  

219
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,663
        so you only hear        
        the musical note,       

220
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,533
          not the sound         
    of metal striking metal.    

221
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,401
       these brass pulleys      

222
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,070
        hang from cables        
   connected to the movement.   

223
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,174
    the pulleys will support    
   the clock's three weights.   

224
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,881
  after connecting the movement 
       to the clock dial,       

225
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,084
        a worker inserts        
     a decorative detail --     

226
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,587
 a wood panel to frame the dial.

227
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,561
        then she installs       
     the clock's second hand    

228
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,364
         into the center        
      of a miniature dial.      

229
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,502
 on the main dial, the hour and 
 the minute hands are attached. 

230
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,370
     depending on the model,    

231
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,008
these aluminum hands are painted
      either black or gold.     

232
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,046
 a decorative nut secures them. 

233
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,194
   finally, the all-important   
      weights and pendulum.     

234
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,797
 the weights are brass canisters
        filled with lead.       

235
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,699
            each one            
     weighs almost 9 pounds.    

236
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:41,138
     the pendulum sways from    
  side to side at an even pace. 

237
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,342
   this ensures that the clock  
      keeps accurate time.      

238
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,211
    it also drives the clock    
      to chime on the hour      

239
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,846
    or fraction of the hour.    

240
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,417
       all you have to do       
   to keep this clock ticking   

241
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,321
is wind it up about once a week.

242
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:07,265
   up next, behind the scenes   
       at a fuse factory.       

243
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,170
            narrator:           
  invented in the 19th century, 

244
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,105
   fuses are designed to blow   

245
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,774
        whenever there's        
        a power overload.       

246
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,177
           this stops           
     the flow of electricity    

247
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,844
   and prevents a wiring fire.  

248
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,181
     we may never see fuses     
           in action,           

249
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,917
     but they're constantly     
     working to protect us      

250
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,286
            wherever            
    electrical current flows.   

251
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,828
 choosing the right fuse depends
    on the amount of current.   

252
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,534
 to make a high-voltage fuse for
 use in electrical substations, 

253
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,938
   this machine cuts notches    
   into a long, silver strip,   

254
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,340
       which will serve as      
       the fuse's element.      

255
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,543
  the notches will help control 
     the way the fuse blows.    

256
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,279
       bits of soft metal       
   are melted onto the strip.   

257
00:16:55,281 --> 00:17:00,217
 these will be the points where 
         the fuse blows.        

258
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,819
  one end of the silver element 

259
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,489
      is welded to the top      
      of a ceramic core...      

260
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,727
       ...and the element       
       is wound around it.      

261
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:23,107
 workers slide the element core 
      into the fuse casing      

262
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,711
    and bend back metal tabs.   

263
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,580
     then, using a soldering    
    technique called brazing,   

264
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,083
 they seal everything together. 

265
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:42,793
  they take a brass washer and  
  wind ignition wire around it. 

266
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,862
       they're assembling       
       the striker pin --       

267
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,997
    the device that indicates   
          a blown fuse          

268
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,566
    and shuts down the power.   

269
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,137
         the striker pin        
    is fitted to the washer,    

270
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,006
  and with the wire protruding, 

271
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:58,676
           it's placed          
     into a holding device.     

272
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:03,181
    explosive powder is added   
      to each striker pin.      

273
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,322
 then the bottom of the pin is  
 plugged with a rubber stopper. 

274
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,300
      next, the striker pin     
is pressed into a brass capsule.

275
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,701
       this will contain        
       the mini-explosion       

276
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,472
     that pushes out the pin    
     when the fuse is blown.    

277
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,512
          this test run         
    shows how it all happens.   

278
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,547
     the pin's ignition wire    

279
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,984
        is wrapped around       
       an electrical post.      

280
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,186
   workers clamp down the pin   

281
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,188
    and position the pendulum   
           that swings          

282
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,859
 to indicate the amount of force
    with which the pin fires.   

283
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,462
         a jolt of power        
    detonates the explosive.    

284
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:57,001
this causes the pin to protrude,
    signifying a blown fuse.    

285
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,476
now, a metal eyelet slides onto 
the striker pin's ignition wire,

286
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,012
      and then a wire coil      
       is attached to it,       

287
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,715
  completing the striker pin's  
        ignition system.        

288
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:20,658
a snare pulls the whole assembly
         into the fuse.         

289
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:30,034
       the end of the coil      
   is tied to the fuse's cap.   

290
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:34,071
and an outer cap is press-fitted
       over the inner one.      

291
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:41,111
         next, the fuse         
      is filled with sand.      

292
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,113
  this sand will absorb energy  
        from the element        

293
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,949
      when the fuse blows.      

294
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:57,595
  automated rods tap the fuses  
  to compact the sand inside.   

295
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,267
       next, an outer cap       
        is lubricated...        

296
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,208
    ...and it's pressed onto    
   the other end of the fuse.   

297
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,217
   this machine spins grooves   
          onto the cap,         

298
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,987
       pinching it tightly      
       to the fuse casing.      

299
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,028
    a current is run through    
    each one of these fuses,    

300
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,763
      checking the voltage      

301
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,067
     to confirm that they're    
     in good working order.     

302
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,038
  sealant is then pumped around 
         the cap's rims         

303
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,174
          to make them          
      completely airtight.      

304
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:50,281
 finally, the safety information
     is affixed to the fuse.    

305
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,984
            and some            
    electrical specifications   

306
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,487
   are stamped onto the caps.   

307
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,459
 now these fuses are ready to go
    with the electrical flow    

308
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,095
   and blow at the first sign   
           of trouble.          

309
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,333
