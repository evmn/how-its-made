2
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,974
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,520
 narrator: a sail is essentially
         a vertical wing        

4
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,656
  that provides forward thrust  
            and lift            

5
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:58,190
  to propel a boat over water.  

6
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,993
     it's impossible to know    
  who came up with the concept  

7
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:03,796
    because boats with sails    
   have been plying waterways   

8
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,131
     for thousands of years.    

9
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,499
      but there's no doubt      

10
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,335
   that when it comes to their  
    design and construction,    

11
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,470
     today's sails have come    
           a long way.          

12
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:16,075
     for thousands of years,    
       sails were square,       

13
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,676
     but in the 3rd century,    

14
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,679
    triangular sails appeared   
      on the mediterranean.     

15
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,749
     the shape enabled boats    
     to sail into the wind,     

16
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,351
       as well as with it.      

17
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:32,958
  modern racing sails are made  
    of laminated synthetics.    

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,560
           they start           
    with a plastic membrane.    

19
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,697
          rollers apply         
      a hot liquid adhesive     

20
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,831
to one side in measured amounts,

21
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:44,470
 because even a couple of extra 
grams would weigh down the sail.

22
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,774
       they press a scrim       
     onto the hot adhesive.     

23
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,644
 it's a superstrength synthetic 
         called aramid,         

24
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,180
    which will keep the sail    
          from tearing.         

25
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,717
         then it's over         
     to a computerized laser    

26
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,488
    that cuts patterns out of   
  the scrim-reinforced plastic. 

27
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,192
  a worker rolls up each panel  

28
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,862
         to transport it        
     to the next worktable.     

29
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,865
    here, they tape 10 to 20    
    of the panels together,     

30
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:17,837
 using heavy-duty p.e.t. plastic
    with an acrylic adhesive.   

31
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,748
   now hundreds of small jacks  
   stretch aluminized plastic   

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,082
       around a framework,      

33
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:33,885
 pulling material into a curved 
       aerodynamic shape.       

34
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,056
     this mold will be used     
       to shape the sail.       

35
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,929
       the team stretches       
   clear plastic film over it.  

36
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,169
         then they drape        
   the joined panels over top.  

37
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:53,371
   they use ropes and clamps    
   to pull it to the contours   

38
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,840
          of the mold.          

39
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:03,115
 and now they're ready for some 
    super tough synthetics --   

40
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,250
 aramid and carbon fiber yarns. 

41
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,053
   the yarns have been coated   
          with adhesive         

42
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,623
        so they'll stick        
      to the plastic film.      

43
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,664
     a robot rolls the yarns    
         onto the film,         

44
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,534
     while a worker follows     
     in a harness overhead      

45
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,335
   to keep an eye on the job.   

46
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:27,672
 the robot applies the yarns in 
a pattern plotted by an engineer

47
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,576
   to anticipate the wind load  
          on this sail.         

48
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,149
     the robot now switches     
      from a vertical path      

49
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,884
      to a horizontal one,      

50
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,287
         applying yarns         
    in a transverse pattern.    

51
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,091
the team installs a long, narrow
    pocket over that section.   

52
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,493
 a batten will later be inserted
         in this pocket         

53
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,896
  to control the sail's shape.  

54
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,700
   they pull another layer of   
 scrim-enhanced plastic on top. 

55
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,571
    and now all the layers of   
  this sail cloth are in place. 

56
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:05,478
   a worker hovers overhead to  
inspect the surface for defects.

57
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,183
they now seal the assembled sail
         in a vacuum bag        

58
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,551
        and attach hoses.       

59
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,258
   the hoses suck out the air,  

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,129
       pressing the layers      
      of the sail together.     

61
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,667
   now the robot applies heat   
          to the sail.          

62
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,736
   it activates the adhesives   
        and the plastics        

63
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,073
to laminate the layers together.

64
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:36,275
        and it also sets        
   the three-dimensional shape  

65
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,343
          of the sail.          

66
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,948
    a worker inspects the job   
    with a magnifying glass.    

67
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,085
         then it's over         
  to a revolving sewing turret. 

68
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,955
  as the sewing machine turns,  
   it pulls the sail forward,   

69
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,158
 allowing the operator to stitch
         hems, grommets,        

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,394
   and reinforcements onto it.  

71
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,099
 they apply the corporate logo. 

72
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:03,302
 next, a worker walks the length
      of this enormous sail     

73
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,170
         to inspect it.         

74
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,907
        no imperfections        
       will be tolerated.       

75
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,842
           after all,           
   this is a big-ticket item.   

76
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,911
  large racing sails can retail 

77
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,815
    for hundreds of thousands   
           of dollars.          

78
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,188
    sophisticated engineering   
     and high-tech materials    

79
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,989
   have produced a racing sail  

80
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,692
       that's lightweight       
     yet incredibly strong.     

81
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,062
 there may be rough water ahead,

82
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,464
       but with technology      
         on their side,         

83
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,568
    this crew should be able    
    to sail right through it.   

84
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,290
            narrator:           
 the walnut has been cultivated 
     for thousands of years,    

85
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,826
    but its actual discovery    
       remains a mystery.       

86
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,095
  some of the earliest evidence 
          of the walnut         

87
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:06,431
 comes from the region of persia
       in 7th century b.c.      

88
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,234
           back then,           
  royalty had dibs on this nut, 

89
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,503
  and commoners were forbidden  
           to eat it.           

90
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,039
           thankfully,          
     that's ancient history.    

91
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,179
        today, the walnut       
        is mass-produced        

92
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:21,914
    to meet a global demand.    

93
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,717
     it starts in an orchard    
  like this one in california.  

94
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,453
walnuts take five years to grow,

95
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,858
    and they emerge shrouded    
      in protective husks.      

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,727
    using mechanical shakers    
          and sweepers,         

97
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,864
  workers harvest the walnuts.  

98
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,266
         once the husks         
      have been peeled off,     

99
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,803
 it's over to the receiving pit 
    at the processing plant.    

100
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,344
   this machine separates out   
      any rocks or sticks,      

101
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,414
     then drops the walnuts     
        into a conveyer.        

102
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,018
     at the end of the line,    

103
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,488
  the nuts spiral off and land  
 softly in cooling bays below --

104
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,826
      8 bays that hold over     
       13 tons of walnuts.      

105
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,496
    the walnuts are funneled    
   into these sealed chambers   

106
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,232
         for fumigation         
      to eliminate insects.     

107
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,703
         after 28 hours,        
 they're on the move once again.

108
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,173
   they fall between rollers.   

109
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,242
 the gaps between these rollers 
           are tapered          

110
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:25,978
   to allow the small, medium,  
         and large nuts         

111
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,113
  to fall into separate lanes.  

112
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:34,987
 this sorting system will allow 
 them to be cracked by machines 

113
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,656
  geared to specific nut sizes. 

114
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,994
       these large walnuts      
       head up a conveyer       

115
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,398
    called the cracker belt.    

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,067
           at the top,          
     they enter the cracker.    

117
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,536
    it's a revolving machine    
          with pistons,         

118
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,505
      one for each walnut.      

119
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,143
         the technician         
      activates the pistons     

120
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,811
   to press against the nuts.   

121
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,015
   the pistons apply a precise  
       amount of pressure       

122
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:06,785
   to crack the shells without  
    damaging the nuts inside.   

123
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,893
the nut cracking has been slowed
         for our camera,        

124
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,263
     but in reality, this is    
     a high-speed operation.    

125
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:24,903
    the nuts, shells and all,   
      fall onto a conveyer.     

126
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:29,975
the pistons have cracked between
   80% and 90% of the walnuts.  

127
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,376
      to capture the rest,      

128
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,979
  the whole pile shakes its way 
      toward a second group     

129
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,948
       of sizing rollers.       

130
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,852
       the smaller pieces       
      drop through the gaps     

131
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,721
 and go for further processing. 

132
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,126
 the larger ones continue on to 
 a machine called a re-cracker. 

133
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:55,134
 there, the nuts travel through 
 slats in a revolving cylinder. 

134
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,136
       inside those slats       
       are little knives        

135
00:08:57,138 --> 00:09:00,672
  that break up the whole nuts. 

136
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,076
 after some of the larger shells
       have been removed,       

137
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,811
   it's on to a giant sifter.   

138
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:09,014
   the nuts and shells bounce   
      on a shaking screen.      

139
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,082
 the smaller bits fall through, 

140
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,552
       and the larger ones      
         remain on top.         

141
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,428
     the holes in the screen    
   become progressively larger  

142
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,763
       to sort the pieces       
        into eight sizes        

143
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,033
   which differ by a fraction   
           of an inch.          

144
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,837
  the bigger, choicest walnuts  
  fall into a separate chute.   

145
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,908
 the smaller pieces will be used
 in baking, among other things. 

146
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,913
        a high-speed belt       
      sends nuts and shells     

147
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,313
     flying through the air     

148
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,851
 to allow a computerized camera 
    to detect shell fragments   

149
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,521
 and activate a system to blast 
 them off the production line,  

150
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,758
   leaving the prized kernel,   
        the walnut half.        

151
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,330
      an inspector removes      
      any remaining shells      

152
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,365
      or unacceptable nuts.     

153
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,535
     then the walnuts enter     
        a vacuum chamber,       

154
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,404
       which suctions away      
        any last crumbs.        

155
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:11,610
 they exit on a spiraling slide 
       and land in a box.       

156
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:16,381
 this packer portions out bulk  
 product for the food industry. 

157
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,216
  he removes nuts from the box  

158
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,719
        until it reaches        
       the correct weight.      

159
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,025
 these walnuts are on their way 

160
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,828
   to adding crunch and flavor  
       to cookies, cakes,       

161
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,297
      and other good stuff.     

162
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,100
    the walnuts in this box     
    have taken years to grow    

163
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,035
 and a couple hours to process, 

164
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:40,639
    but in the end, the wait    
  should be more than worth it. 

165
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,526
    narrator: on the street,    
    it's known as "the boot."   

166
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,062
        accumulate a few        
     unpaid parking tickets,    

167
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:07,065
      and you may very well     
   find your car wearing one.   

168
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,468
       municipalities use       
       wheel immobilizers       

169
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,869
   to clamp down on offenders,  

170
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,108
 while universities use them to 
deter illegal parking on campus.

171
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,214
         the boot's dome        
       goes over the rim.       

172
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,616
       on the other side,       

173
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:28,554
       its inner arm hooks      
  in between the rim and brake. 

174
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,757
a secure bolt clamps those outer
    and inner parts together,   

175
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,026
     immobilizing the wheel.    

176
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,761
      boots must be strong      
        and tamper-proof,       

177
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,364
     so the main components     
       are made of steel.       

178
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,468
   this steel tube will become  
      the boot's outer arm.     

179
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,774
         this steel bar         
      will become the stand     

180
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,276
     that props up the boot     
      during installation.      

181
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:55,380
       this flat steel bar      
    will become the inner arm   

182
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,749
   that hooks between the rim   
           and brake.           

183
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,658
     they bend it lengthwise    
      to give it strength.      

184
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,261
        then they bend it       
      into the final shape.     

185
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,639
  now back to the tube they cut 
       for the outer arm.       

186
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,682
 after bending it in two spots, 

187
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,018
      they drill two holes      
          for the tube          

188
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,120
that will house the secure bolt.

189
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,499
   they bend a flat steel bar   
       to make a stiffener      

190
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,301
 that reinforces the inner arm. 

191
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,039
   meanwhile, that steel bar    
   they cut to make the stand   

192
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,875
   goes onto a machine called   
          a rod bender.         

193
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,723
   a welder now fuses the tube  
       to the outer arm...      

194
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:17,129
   ...then welds that assembly  
 to a part called the body box. 

195
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,738
   after welding the stiffener  
        to the inner arm,       

196
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,407
  he welds a pin through holes  
         in both the arm        

197
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,609
        and the other end       
        of the body box,        

198
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,979
      so now the inner arm      
       hinges on the box.       

199
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,552
after a coat of baked-on enamel,
  the boot's body is complete.  

200
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,056
   the dome measures 12 inches  
          in diameter.          

201
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,095
             first,             
   they weld a bracket to it.   

202
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:53,298
     next, they fit a sleeve    
        into the bracket        

203
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,234
        and thread a pin        
       through them both.       

204
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,704
     then they weld the pin     
         to the bracket.        

205
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,840
    so now the sleeve pivots.   

206
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,080
       this, too, receives      
   a baked-on coat of enamel.   

207
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,318
   now they glue a rubber trim  
      over the dome's edge      

208
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,621
      so that booting a car     
     doesn't damage the rim.    

209
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:30,601
      it's time to assemble     
         all the parts.         

210
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,672
first, the mechanism that clamps
the boot's inner and outer arms 

211
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,340
        around the tire.        

212
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,475
      using a special key,      

213
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,877
         they screw into        
      a stainless-steel nut     

214
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,346
      inside the bolt tube.     

215
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:45,016
 this spring holds the inner arm
    in the correct position.    

216
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,019
 the stand goes on with a bolt. 

217
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,956
   the stand elevates the boot  
         off the ground,        

218
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,494
     enabling the installer     
  to turn the secure bolt key.  

219
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,428
        in this cutaway,        

220
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,032
 you can see how turning the key
 moves the secure bolt forward, 

221
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,536
pushing the inner and outer arms
   together to clamp the tire.  

222
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:12,244
next, they slide the dome sleeve
   over the body's outer arm.   

223
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,516
       they align the hole      
          in the sleeve         

224
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,587
    with the hole in the arm,   
  then bolt the parts together. 

225
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,856
    the arm has several holes   

226
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:29,527
   so the boot can accommodate  
   wheels of different sizes.   

227
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,796
  every boot gets a metal plate 

228
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,599
       bearing the model        
       and serial number.       

229
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,869
      the boot manufacturer     
    records who owns the boot   

230
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,538
         and won't issue        
      a new secure bolt key     

231
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,507
 without proper identification. 

232
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,360
            narrator:           
from the mechanics to the cabin,

233
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,963
        aircraft are made       
   with the most lightweight,   

234
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,564
    high-strength materials,    

235
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,033
       such as honeycomb        
       structural panels.       

236
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,969
          these make up         
      the support structure     

237
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,772
   hidden beneath the flooring  
    and behind the walls of,    

238
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,173
       among other areas,       

239
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,643
    the lavatories, galleys,    
         and stow bins.         

240
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,451
     the cells at the center    
     of the structural panel    

241
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,253
 are hexagonal in those designed
           to lie flat          

242
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:32,257
         and rectangular        
        in curved panels.       

243
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,261
    producing the core begins   
 with giant printing cylinders. 

244
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,664
    etched into their surface   
     is a pattern of lines.     

245
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,467
           they rotate          
   in heat-activated adhesive,  

246
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,735
    printing the line pattern   
           onto paper           

247
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,072
    that passes between them.   

248
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,541
       this paper is made       
       of thermoplastic,        

249
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:52,143
    but depending on the type   
            of panel,           

250
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,614
 it can be another kind of paper
     or even aluminum foil.     

251
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,152
   this machine cuts the paper  
         into sheets --         

252
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,755
        anywhere from 500       
        to 2,000 sheets,        

253
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,791
     depending on how thick     
       the cores will be.       

254
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:13,164
   the machine then stacks the  
 sheets in a specific sequence. 

255
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,501
   every other sheet is offset  
         by half a line.        

256
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,635
   this back-and-forth pattern  

257
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:21,473
    is what forms the core's    
        honeycomb cells.        

258
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,516
       the stack now goes       
      into a heated press,      

259
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,120
    which activates and cures   
     the lines of adhesive,     

260
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,521
       bonding the sheets.      

261
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,391
         after an hour,         
      they remove the stack     

262
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,727
 and attach aluminum-foil loops 
      along its perimeter.      

263
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,399
    then they stand the stack   
           on its side          

264
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,534
      and hook those loops      
      onto the steel pins       

265
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:53,138
           of a device          
   called an expansion frame.   

266
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,876
      it slowly pulls apart     
           the sheets,          

267
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,811
   opening the honeycomb cells  

268
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,681
        that the special        
    stacking sequence formed.   

269
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,749
 to ease the expansion process, 

270
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,152
      they soften the paper     
           with water.          

271
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,558
   this is a time-lapse shot.   

272
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,962
       the full expansion       
     takes about 15 minutes.    

273
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,099
         next, the block        
       goes into an oven,       

274
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,301
         where it bakes         
      for about a half-hour     

275
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,371
   at 527 degrees fahrenheit.   

276
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,174
         that heats sets        
    the thermoplastic paper,    

277
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,444
locking in the honeycomb shapes.

278
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:37,381
  now they repeatedly submerge  
  the block in a vat of resin,  

279
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,451
    baking it after each dip.   

280
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,156
  here, an aspirator sucks out  
        the excess resin.       

281
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,861
   then, after a final baking,  

282
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,331
     an automated saw slices    
     the block horizontally     

283
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,333
       into several cores.      

284
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,208
         then it's over         
     to the assembly table.     

285
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,012
   they construct a structural  
    panel like a sandwich --    

286
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,415
       the honeycomb core       
         in the center.         

287
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,817
         this one's made        
        of aluminum foil.       

288
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,020
     then on either side of     
    the panel's outer sheets,   

289
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,390
          in this case,         
      made of carbon fiber.     

290
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,893
     on the top and bottom,     

291
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,361
    workers position a sheet    
        of release paper        

292
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,297
      to prevent the panel      
          from sticking         

293
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,734
  to the metal sheets that hold 
 everything in position for now.

294
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,908
    workers load the assembly   
          into a press.         

295
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,950
 the heat and pressure combined 
      bond all the layers.      

296
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,253
      about an hour later,      

297
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,056
     they take the sandwich     
        out of the press        

298
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,858
  and remove the metal sheets.  

299
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,005
     workers slap on labels     

300
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,774
     identifying the product    
        and manufacturer.       

301
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,948
       then they shear off      
    the panel's rough edges.    

302
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,964
      the factory subjects      
          some samples          

303
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,766
           to a series          
   of quality-control checks.   

304
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,635
  this load test, for example,  

305
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,371
       assesses how much        
       the panel can flex       

306
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:44,108
   and how much weight it can   
   withstand before snapping.   

307
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,712
     whatever the materials,    
     thickness, or density,     

308
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,716
     these structural panels    
  all deliver maximum strength  

309
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,384
      with minimal weight.      

310
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,998
