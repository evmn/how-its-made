00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,524
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,961
      decorative moldings.      

5
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,800
       commercial pulleys.      

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,706
     industrial rubber hose.    

7
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,644
    and sheet vinyl flooring.   

8
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,120
 when you consider the high cost
         of renovations,        

9
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,589
     architectural moldings     
         are an easy way        

10
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,325
 to get a lot of decorative bang
         for your buck.         

11
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,195
    by adding a crown molding   
       along the ceiling,       

12
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,930
   baseboard molding, casings,  

13
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,132
         and maybe even         
      a chair-rail molding,     

14
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,868
  you can take a room from drab 
           to dazzling          

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,570
   without breaking the bank.   

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,545
       decorative moldings      
   can be made of solid wood,   

17
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:23,549
   medium-density fiberboard,   
     or finger-jointed pine.    

18
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,152
     these planks of eastern    
   white pine are on their way  

19
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,621
           to becoming          
     finger-jointed molding.    

20
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,823
          they've just          
      come out of the kiln.     

21
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,693
      a hygrometer measures     
   the humidity in each plank   

22
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,563
       to ensure the wood       
  is dry enough to cut cleanly. 

23
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,766
    a worker directs a laser    

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,903
     to read the dimensions     
    of each and every plank.    

25
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,440
       the laser transmits      
 that information to a computer,

26
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,709
      which guides a plane      
      further up the line       

27
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,578
       to shave the plank       
      to the required width     

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,247
         and square it.         

29
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,051
     this process transforms    
     the plank into a block.    

30
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,959
      the blocks now enter      
 a high-tech piece of equipment 

31
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,261
    that identifies defects.    

32
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,462
          as each block         
       enters the machine,      

33
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,167
        a scanner records       
        all its features.       

34
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,135
    it sends that information   
          to a computer         

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,072
which calculates a cutting plan.

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,020
     guided by the computer,    

37
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:40,159
    a saw chops out any knots   
      or poor-quality wood.     

38
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,368
     the machine's kickers,     
       as they're called,       

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,737
        boot the cutoffs        
       from the conveyer.       

40
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,517
     the blocks continue on,    

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,387
         running against        
   razor-sharp rotating heads   

42
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,956
    that carve finger joints    
          on the ends.          

43
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,532
        the next station        
        coats the joints        

44
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,402
    with industrial-strength    
        carpenter's glue.       

45
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,542
 the conveyer picks up speed now

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,812
  and butts the blocks together 
       with high pressure.      

47
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,582
 the joints lock in a tight fit.

48
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,492
 when the glue dries, the joints
      strengthen even more.     

49
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,634
the jointed blocks are connected
      in a continuous unit.     

50
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,204
        a saw now cuts it       
 into standard molding lengths. 

51
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,910
    these lengths are known     
    as finger-jointed blanks    

52
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,912
      because they haven't      
          been shaped.          

53
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,189
         a saw now cuts         
      the blanks lengthwise     

54
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,926
to the thickness of the specific
   molding they're producing.   

55
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,410
         the final step         
    is to profile the blanks.   

56
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:42,413
   a machine called a molder    
   uses rotating steel knives   

57
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,150
        to carve the wood       
     to the required shape.     

58
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,520
   there's a different knife    
   for each style of molding.   

59
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,633
     the molder transforms      
     the blanks to moldings     

60
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,202
      at a rate of 100 feet     
           per minute.          

61
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:27,258
          moldings made         
     of finger-jointed pine     

62
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,394
  or medium-density fiberboard  

63
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,829
     are the least expensive    
         on the market,         

64
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,333
  but you can't stain them like 
  moldings made of solid wood.  

65
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,336
    they have to be painted.    

66
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,615
            narrator:           
       a pulley is a wheel      

67
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,217
 with a grooved or barreled rim 

68
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,419
      in which you can run      
         a rope or belt.        

69
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,288
      it's a simple device      
      used to lift a load       

70
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,892
      that's hard to access     
  or too heavy to move by hand. 

71
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,628
             pulleys            
   and multiple-pulley systems  

72
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,865
      are vital components      
   of many types of machines.   

73
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,038
   these pulleys are designed   
             for use            

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,774
    in small- to large-scale    
       electric motors --       

75
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,977
     for example, fan belts     
 in the air-circulation systems 

76
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,715
      of office buildings,      
      factories, and mines.     

77
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,450
  the factory makes its pulleys 

78
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,653
        from a 50/50 mix        
    of scrap iron and steel.    

79
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,390
  the furnace heats the metal   
  to 2,500 degrees fahrenheit,  

80
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,260
         slightly above         
   the metal's melting point.   

81
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,198
         workers adjust         
    the chemical composition    

82
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,533
  by adding carbon and silicon. 

83
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,505
  the right recipe is essential 
  for producing quality metal.  

84
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,476
         in the furnace,        
     the metal's impurities,    

85
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,279
          called slag,          
      rise to the surface.      

86
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,649
    workers use giant paddles   
         to skim it off.        

87
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,891
      once the lab analyzes     
    and approves the sample,    

88
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,760
          they transfer         
    the molten metal by ladle   

89
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,729
  to a 30-ton holding furnace.  

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
this furnace maintains the metal

91
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,770
          at a constant         
    2,500 degrees fahrenheit,   

92
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,107
    the required temperature    
      for a proper casting.     

93
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,577
  you can't pour metal this hot 
       into a metal mold.       

94
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,513
    the mold would just melt.   

95
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,182
           so instead,          
   the factory uses damp sand.  

96
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,186
  sand withstands intense heat  
        by absorbing it.        

97
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,921
   the machine forms the molds  

98
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,358
     much the way you'd use     
  a pail to form a sand castle. 

99
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,769
       it first constructs      
  the bottom half of the mold.  

100
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,275
   this filter will screen out  
       any slag particles       

101
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,811
        the molten metal        
       may still contain.       

102
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,815
  and these cores create empty  
      spaces within a part.     

103
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,053
      now the machine forms     
    the top half of the mold.   

104
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,101
            they slip           
     a weighted metal jacket    

105
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,437
 around the finished sand mold. 

106
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,240
 this keeps it from collapsing  
 under the weight of the metal. 

107
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,310
     workers fill the molds     
        right to the top.       

108
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,112
 it takes from 30 to 45 minutes 

109
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,182
      for the molten metal      
          to solidify.          

110
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,151
           they remove          
  the weighted metal jacket...  

111
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,923
      ...then dump the mold     
 into what's call the shakeout. 

112
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,126
      the vibration breaks      
      the sand mold apart,      

113
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,661
  releasing the metal pulleys.  

114
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,403
    while the pulleys go off    
         to be cleaned,         

115
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,206
      the sand is recycled      
         into new molds.        

116
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,477
 the pulleys are in rough form. 

117
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:09,013
 they still have to be machined 
       to specifications.       

118
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,151
     a robot places each one    
  under a computerized camera.  

119
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,920
  a visual-recognition program  
        guides the robot        

120
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,889
 to position the pulley properly

121
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,592
          into various          
   automated-tooling machines.  

122
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:27,065
       this first machine       
   makes the pulley's grooves.  

123
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,634
        the next machine        
   will drill holes in the hub  

124
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,903
   for installing the screws.   

125
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,639
           at the end           
    of the machining process,   

126
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,775
        a gauging system        
   takes precise measurements   

127
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:42,447
    and guides the equipment    
     to correct any errors.     

128
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,251
   this is a two-part pulley,   
   known as a variable pulley,  

129
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,454
    because it can run a belt   
       at variable speeds.      

130
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,056
      this tooling machine      

131
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,792
   performs several operations  
     on the male component.     

132
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,929
it machines the face and outside
      diameter on one side,     

133
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,199
   then flips the pulley over   
  to make the bore and threads  

134
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,300
       on the other side.       

135
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,617
 the last operation drills holes
         for two screws         

136
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,621
  that will affix the pulley to 
the shaft of the electric motor.

137
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,490
      a touch of lubricant,     

138
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,293
 and the next machine assembles 
   the male and female parts.   

139
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,362
 after setting the proper speed,

140
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,799
    the user locks the parts    
    in position with a screw.   

141
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,443
            narrator:           
 many industries use rubber hose

142
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,912
 in their day-to-day operations.

143
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:51,783
  they use it to remove water,  
        clear out waste,        

144
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,785
   or supply certain machines   

145
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,721
        with air, water,        
        or raw materials.       

146
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,857
  for instance, food producers  
     might feed ingredients     

147
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,761
      through a rubber hose     
          into a mixer.         

148
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,998
 this company makes low-pressure

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,268
       and medium-pressure      
          rubber hoses.         

150
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,469
        the intended use        

151
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,405
       is what determines       
     the rubber composition.    

152
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,674
    function also determines    
           the color,           

153
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,011
    because industrial hoses    
     are often color-coded.     

154
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,948
       the rubber arrives       
         at the factory         

155
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,484
        from the supplier       
        in rough strips.        

156
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,086
        the first step is       
    to run it through a mill.   

157
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,621
  the rollers heat the rubber,  

158
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,025
   softening and smoothing it   
       to an even texture.      

159
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,765
      the next machine cuts     
      the rubber in strips      

160
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,834
      to the precise width      
          and thickness         

161
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:46,271
  required for the size of hose 
   they're going to construct.  

162
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,708
        workers lubricate       
         a steel mandrel        

163
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,044
      that's the exact size     
       of the hose's bore.      

164
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,582
 as the mandrel spins, they wrap
    a rubber strip around it,   

165
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,819
 measuring and layering to build
    the necessary thickness.    

166
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,199
   next, they add one or more   
      reinforcement layers.     

167
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,336
      this strip is made of     
a high-strength synthetic fabric

168
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,472
  that's been coated in rubber. 

169
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,807
          it's designed         
    to withstand the pressure   

170
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,344
       to which the hose        
       will be subjected.       

171
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,281
 the last layer of rubber forms 
  the hose's outside covering.  

172
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,351
    after verifying the final   
      diameter is correct,      

173
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,154
    they wrap the entire hose   
      construction tightly      

174
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,490
       in wet nylon tape.       

175
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,358
   the tape will later shrink   

176
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,361
          and compress          
   all the materials together.  

177
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,163
  this factory also makes hoses 

178
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,765
   with a built-in attachment   
           on the end.          

179
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,767
they position it on the mandrel,

180
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,436
    then glue the first layer   
        of rubber to it.        

181
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,375
     this bond is reinforced    
   with special textile strips  

182
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,110
       and tightly wound,       

183
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,781
         high-strength,         
       carbon-steel wire.       

184
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,448
     they continue the wire     

185
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,251
   more loosely down the body   
           of the hose          

186
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,055
  at a specific angle designed  
  to withstand vacuum pressure. 

187
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,192
     then they wrap the hose    
in a soft, stretchy rubber strip

188
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,328
       that fills the gaps      
       between the wires.       

189
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,130
       next comes a layer       

190
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,332
        of high-strength,       
      rubber-coated fabric,     

191
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,534
         then, finally,         
    the exterior covering --    

192
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,403
        light blue rubber       
         for this model.        

193
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,607
         again, the hose        
       is pressure-wrapped      

194
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,941
      with wet nylon tape.      

195
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,278
          then, to make         
     the hose more flexible,    

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,480
    they create corrugations    
 by wrapping it tightly in rope.

197
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,483
 what's under the rope compacts,
         creating a dip.        

198
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,886
     they add another layer     
          of nylon tape         

199
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,022
   to hold the rope in place.   

200
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,959
 when construction is finished, 
           the hoses,           

201
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,429
  on their respective mandrels, 
      go into an autoclave,     

202
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,230
      a cylindrical chamber     

203
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,367
 into which they feed hot steam 
        at high pressure.       

204
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,704
   this vulcanization process,  
         as it's called,        

205
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,906
  triggers a chemical reaction  

206
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,308
     that cures the rubber,     
       making it elastic.       

207
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,378
     once the hoses come out    
            and cool,           

208
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,514
    workers remove the tape.    

209
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,717
           the layers           
     are solidly compressed.    

210
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:16,888
    they wash the nylon tape,   
    then rewind and reuse it.   

211
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,399
  now workers begin the process 

212
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,469
      of removing the hose      
        from the mandrel.       

213
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,272
 they tie one end with the rope 
       to create pressure,      

214
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,342
     then gently pump water     
 between the mandrel and rubber.

215
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,144
          the lubricant         
      they applied earlier      

216
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,414
    has prevented the rubber    
   from sticking to the steel,  

217
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,550
  so the hose separates easily. 

218
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,957
      they simply slide it      
        off the mandrel.        

219
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,693
 workers will now trim the ends,

220
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,296
   cut the hose to the length   
      the customer ordered,     

221
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,765
 then coil and package the hose.

222
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,810
 this factory makes a wide range
    of industrial rubber hose   

223
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,846
     in different diameters,    
      different bore sizes,     

224
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,917
       and varying degrees      
         of flexibility.        

225
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,919
         some hoses have        
       specialty features,      

226
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,322
 such as heat-resistant fabrics 

227
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,125
          incorporated          
  right into the rubber layers. 

228
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,539
       narrator: in 1860,       
an englishman invented linoleum,

229
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,475
 a revolutionary floor covering 

230
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:49,147
 made of linseed oil, pigments, 
  pine rosin, and pine flower.  

231
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,751
  a century later in the 1960s, 
  vinyl flooring was introduced 

232
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:57,322
     and eventually rendered    
   linoleum flooring obsolete.  

233
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,630
         vinyl flooring         
       owes its existence       

234
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,567
       to a german chemist      
          who, in 1872,         

235
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:13,504
  invented polyvinyl chloride,  
             or pvc.            

236
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,107
       pvc was considered       
 a thoroughly useless substance 

237
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,442
        until the 1920s,        

238
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,113
   when an american researcher  
     tried to make it useful    

239
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,314
 by turning it into an adhesive.

240
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,251
       he didn't succeed,       
      but, in the process,      

241
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:31,188
    he accidently discovered    
  that heating pvc in a solvent 

242
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,258
         transformed it         
    into a flexible plastic,    

243
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,794
  what we know today as vinyl.  

244
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,410
   sheet-vinyl flooring comes   
   in a wide range of designs,  

245
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,949
 some of which simulate ceramic 
   tiles or hardwood flooring.  

246
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,952
         as we see here         
       under a microscope,      

247
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,488
   vinyl flooring is comprised  
     of three components --     

248
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,756
      a felt-paper backing      
         on the bottom,         

249
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,225
      a layer of vinyl foam     
         in the middle,         

250
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,094
 on which they print the design,

251
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,231
     and a protective layer     
  of transparent vinyl on top.  

252
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,301
 to create texture, the factory 
      applies an inhibitor      

253
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,039
       to prevent the foam      
 from expanding in select areas.

254
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,307
    to make that vinyl foam,    

255
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,043
         they first mix         
   the powdered ingredients --  

256
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,713
   polyvinyl chloride resins,   
     or pvc, white pigment,     

257
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,382
     and calcium carbonate,     
     which acts as a filler,    

258
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,652
      but also helps color      
       the mixture white.       

259
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,321
      in a separate mixer,      
    the liquid ingredients --   

260
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,458
       plasticizer to make      
       the vinyl flexible,      

261
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,127
      fungicide to prevent      
          mold growth,          

262
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,663
        u.v. stabilizers        
       to prevent fading,       

263
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,199
      and a blowing agent,      
    which they later activate   

264
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,334
      to inflate the foam.      

265
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,603
     they combine the liquid    
           and powders          

266
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,339
 and mix for another 15 minutes.

267
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,208
   after filtering the mixture  

268
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,478
       to remove any lumps      
     or paper-bag fragments,    

269
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,347
      the liquid foam goes      
     to the production line.    

270
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,150
      there, a large coater     
      applies an even layer     

271
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,620
     to a continuous sheet      
     of felt-paper backing.     

272
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,490
       the coated backing       
   then passes through an oven  

273
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,825
      for about 15 seconds.     

274
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,428
           the heat --          
    430 degrees fahrenheit --   

275
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,296
   solidifies the liquid foam,  

276
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,900
         fusing the pvc         
         to the backing.        

277
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:27,438
at this point, it's critical not
 to activate the blowing agent. 

278
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,772
       the floor's design       

279
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,976
    will be printed directly    
      on this foam surface.     

280
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,913
   a graphic designer creates   
    the artwork by computer.    

281
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:40,051
then a colorist experiments with
  dozens of color combinations  

282
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,587
         before deciding        
      on which ones to use.     

283
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,123
    the computer breaks down    
    the final design by color   

284
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,527
       in order to produce      
 an engraved plate for each one.

285
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,797
    they test out the design    
       on a piece of foam,      

286
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,000
printing one color after another
  until the design is complete. 

287
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,271
     on the production line,    
  printing works the same way.  

288
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,874
           but because          
   it's a continuous process,   

289
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:06,010
  they use rotating cylinders   
  rather than engraved plates.  

290
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,346
     the flooring just rolls    
       right through them,      

291
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,949
 receiving up to six ink colors 
         one at a time.         

292
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,653
      a drier dries the ink     
    in between applications.    

293
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,645
     now it's time to apply     
     the floor's top layer.     

294
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,916
   this coat of vinyl is known  
        as the wear layer       

295
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,785
  because it will be subjected  
to the wear and tear of walking.

296
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,122
         the wear layer         
       protects the design      

297
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,590
           printed on           
   the vinyl foam underneath.   

298
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,727
       made of pvc resins       
        and plasticizer,        

299
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,664
        it goes on white        
      but turns transparent     

300
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,467
     when fused in the oven     
   at 430 degrees fahrenheit.   

301
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,870
        at the same time,       
      the heat of the oven      

302
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,340
   activates the blowing agent  
  in the vinyl foam underneath, 

303
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,942
          expanding it.         

304
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,010
      to create a texture,      

305
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,746
    they use a process called   
       chemical embossing,      

306
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,082
   in which select ink colors   
  contain a chemical inhibitor  

307
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,084
   to suppress foam expansion.  

308
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:25,089
    wherever they print those   
 colors, the foam remains flat. 

309
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,825
     these height variations    
          create relief         

310
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,429
    and simulate grout lines    
   in imitation-tile designs.   

311
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,498
 to give the surface a sharper, 
       more natural look,       

312
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,966
      the flooring proceeds     

313
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,970
       to a second process      
  called mechanical embossing,  

314
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,504
   in which an engraved roller  

315
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,572
      imprints its pattern      
        onto the surface.       

316
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,909
 the gloss level of the flooring

317
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,446
    varies with the chemical    
 composition of the wear layer. 

318
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,051
         workers inspect        
      the finished flooring     

319
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,587
         as it rolls off        
      the production line.      

320
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,988
       it's 12 feet wide,       

321
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,859
    wide enough for seamless    
   installation in most rooms.  

322
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,996
          the packaging         
     is entirely automated.     

323
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,832
  this equipment winds 100 feet 

324
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,234
     of sheet-vinyl flooring    
            per roll.
