today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,158
aluminum screw caps --

5
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,096
we'll pop the top
off this manufacturing secret.

6
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,631
chocolate --

7
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:37,835
there's nothing like
the taste of sweet success.

8
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,237
pills --

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,173
watch as directed.

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,176
and pasta --

11
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,313
we'll visit a factory that
churns out oodles of noodles.

12
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,453
twisting off
an aluminum screw cap

13
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,322
may lack the style
and sophistication

14
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,325
of uncorking
a fine bottle of wine.

15
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,793
but as devices go,

16
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,463
these caps are one
of the easiest ways

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,199
to put an airtight seal
on a bottle or jar,

18
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:13,071
and the added bonus is that
they're entirely recyclable.

19
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,943
there are hundreds of everyday
objects that are capped.

20
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:23,147
this plant makes 250 million
metal screw caps yearly

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,949
in 12 different sizes.

22
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,283
the caps are made

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,619
from these 11-square-foot sheets
of aluminum

24
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,821
weighing one pound.

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,959
some 3,500 thin aluminum sheets
pass through this feeder.

26
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,761
they begin by coloring
the aluminum sheet

27
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,766
with a colored varnish --
a lacquer and an ink.

28
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,768
then 12 minutes of drying
is needed.

29
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,639
the colored sheets set off
on a conveyor for drying.

30
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,712
then designs are produced.

31
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,348
the coloring is applied
by this varnisher.

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,656
the aluminum sheets pass through
the varnisher one at a time.

33
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,265
here we see the sheet printed.

34
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,300
above are the colors used.

35
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,808
they are highly colored inks
that adhere well to metal.

36
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,679
suction cups grab the sheets

37
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,616
and send them toward
the transport system

38
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,950
of the punch press.

39
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,354
this press will give the caps
the required shape.

40
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:42,360
but the caps have to be machined
in successive steps by molds,

41
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,761
such as this one.

42
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,832
the punches first cut the caps.

43
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,636
over 500 caps a minute
can be produced.

44
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,639
the blades of the punches
are made of carbide,

45
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:59,377
a very hard metal that can cut
tens of millions of caps.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,646
at the exit point
of the punch press,

47
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:05,316
the caps are formed, but don't
yet have the right dimension.

48
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:11,255
this stretching press performs
the last two cold-forming steps

49
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,225
so that the tube will have
the required length.

50
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,929
now for the second stretching.

51
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,198
this achieves
the desired diameter.

52
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,734
when the cap exits the press,

53
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:27,338
it will finally have
the desired dimensions.

54
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,409
at this point, the cap now has
the required shape.

55
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,012
the caps now have to be
decorated

56
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,881
to the client's requirements.

57
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,352
the lateral imprint is made with
this silk-screen-type decorator

58
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:45,823
which colors some 100 caps
in 60 seconds.

59
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,495
the decorator uses an ink

60
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,565
specially formulated to adhere
to metal.

61
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,408
the caps will then dry
in a warm-air oven.

62
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,983
the dried caps are ejected
and fall into a container.

63
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,455
this other flexographic type
of decorator

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,858
prints 155 caps a minute.

65
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,194
we can clearly see
the ink roller,

66
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,462
which imprints the side
of the caps

67
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,065
as they rotate against it
in a steady stream.

68
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,841
all that's required now is to
form the cap and make the cut.

69
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,145
the profiling and jointing
machine

70
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,850
makes the cuts and reliefs
on 200 caps per minute.

71
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,523
machining the cap takes
but a fraction of a second.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,964
they sometimes have to assure
the watertightness

73
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,434
of a container
such as a wine bottle.

74
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,637
for this, a polypropylene liner
is inserted,

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,206
which hermetically
seals the container.

76
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,845
a check is carried out
under a light

77
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,914
to verify whether the cut
has been properly made

78
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,184
and the ridges well-formed.

79
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,653
at last, the final steps --

80
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,922
this screw-tightening machine
hermetically seals the caps

81
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,725
onto the bottles.

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,199
the 250 million screw caps
made here each year

83
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:40,037
call for the machining
of 1,000 tons of aluminum.

84
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,215
narrator: working
in a chocolate factory --

85
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,884
talk about
a childhood fantasy.

86
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,287
well, "how it's made"
is about to take a bite

87
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,689
out of one of the all-time
great dream jobs.

88
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,960
just beware
of the occupational hazards --

89
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:07,631
stomachache, weight gain,
and cavities.

90
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,504
these delicious chocolate
confections

91
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,573
are made from melted chocolate
flowing into molds.

92
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,376
the master molds
are first made of wood

93
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,045
or plaster of paris.

94
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,983
they are then reproduced as
copies in an epoxy material.

95
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:29,787
to allow them to become flexible
and give them the desired shape,

96
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,789
the sheets of epoxy
are first heated

97
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,059
to 350 degrees.

98
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:40,464
the epoxy sheet is then placed
onto the original molds.

99
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,837
the sheet is heated,
then lifted off.

100
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,873
suction from a vacuum system

101
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,544
makes it adhere perfectly
to the shapes of the molds.

102
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,615
here we see the epoxy adhering
to the master molds.

103
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:01,618
still hot and malleable,
the plastic has to be cooled.

104
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,353
a jet of compressed air

105
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,756
effectively lowers
its temperature.

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,694
the mold undergoes
a visual inspection

107
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,030
to make certain of its quality.

108
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:16,934
and now we move on
to the chocolate.

109
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,975
this melting unit, whose shell
is fed by boiling water,

110
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,576
is like a double boiler

111
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,714
and melts 1 1/2 tons
of chocolate in 12 hours

112
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,250
at about 100 degrees.

113
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,120
the ready-to-be-filled
plastic molds

114
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,189
are placed onto a conveyor.

115
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,591
filling is done automatically.

116
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:44,128
liquid chocolate runs directly
into the molds.

117
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,998
this particular machine produces
400 hearts a minute.

118
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,068
the hearts are filled
with a concoction of chocolate,

119
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,205
cream, and coffee that has been
brewed for several minutes.

120
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,808
it takes 20 minutes
for the chocolate to set

121
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,613
as the molds move along
on this 9-level conveyor.

122
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:07,084
well-hardened, the hearts arrive
at the unmolding point.

123
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,819
the molds are turned over,

124
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,421
and a rod lightly taps them
on the bottom

125
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,725
to allow the chocolates to fall
out without being broken.

126
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,332
the chocolates fall out
onto a sheet.

127
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,701
as soon as they've been emptied,

128
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,571
the molds return to the starting
point on the line

129
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,440
to be newly filled.

130
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,579
during their transport
on the line,

131
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,482
the chocolates complete
their cooling and hardening.

132
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,458
now they're going to be prepared
for packaging.

133
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,729
packaging depends
on customers' preferences.

134
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:55,532
the chocolates can be sold
in bulk or placed in boxes.

135
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,371
here, 185 hearts
are put into each box.

136
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,940
like the pure chocolate,

137
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:07,077
white chocolate comes in
as slabs before melting.

138
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,479
milk chocolate
is often delivered

139
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,016
in the form
of one-inch pastilles.

140
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,885
some chocolates are hollow.

141
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,221
they have to be molded
in two halves.

142
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,156
these chocolate bears
need special decorations

143
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,560
applied by hand before
the pouring of liquid chocolate.

144
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,963
this decoration is made
of white chocolate

145
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,032
with an added colorant.

146
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:34,037
in just one hour,
they will make 1,200 bears.

147
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,641
they're made by joining
two hollow chocolate halves.

148
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,048
the assembly is done using
a refrigerated rotating machine.

149
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:51,455
this machine turns the molds
a full 360 degrees on two axes

150
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,857
and vibrates the chocolates

151
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,059
to prevent the formation
of air bubbles.

152
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,128
the chocolates rotate
for five minutes

153
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,331
before being sent
to the cooling conveyor,

154
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,901
where they will remain
for another 20-minute period.

155
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,739
and now they're ready.

156
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,274
at this point,
the bears are unmolded,

157
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,677
and they head off for packaging.

158
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,953
each year,

159
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,091
this company processes 550 tons
of pure chocolate.

160
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,292
many thousands of products
are made here

161
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,397
using 400 different molds
in a variety of sizes.

162
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,311
narrator: now, here's a topic
that's easy to swallow --

163
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,114
how drug companies
make the pills we take.

164
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,850
it's a carefully-monitored
process

165
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:56,453
in which quality control
is paramount.

166
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,855
so stand by --

167
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,458
we're going to give you a taste
of your own medicine,

168
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,627
or at least
what goes into making it.

169
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,735
medications are essential
in the treatment of illnesses.

170
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,604
it begins by a grinding process

171
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:16,606
where the active ingredient
in a tablet or pill

172
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,409
is ground and mixed
with a binding agent.

173
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,079
the quantity of the ingredient
needed to be ground

174
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,749
is transported to the dryer
in this container.

175
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,484
like all the other equipment,

176
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,019
this container is made
of stainless steel

177
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,822
so as not to contaminate
the product.

178
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,358
the temperature of the dryer

179
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:38,162
and the airflow are programmed
with this interface.

180
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,969
the granulation has to be dried
at around 100 or 120 degrees

181
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:50,441
before being shaped
into the desired tablet form.

182
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,644
molding of the pills
is done by this press,

183
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,646
which crushes the powder.

184
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,714
the press exerts a pressure

185
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,384
varying between
two and five tons.

186
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,720
here's how the molding
is done --

187
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,322
the press magazine distributes
the powder

188
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,057
in molds made of steel disks.

189
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,594
two stampers, one above
and the other below,

190
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,664
crush the powder
and form the pill.

191
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,602
here the press operates
at full capacity.

192
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,139
it can produce 5,000 pills
per minute.

193
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:27,544
quality testing is carried out
on 5 pills every 15 minutes.

194
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,547
their hardness is verified
with this apparatus

195
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,950
in which jaws crush it
with a force

196
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:37,821
varying between .3 and 3 psi,
or pounds per square inch.

197
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,958
the pills must now be coated
so that they won't crumble.

198
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:46,096
a coating solution made of water
and coloring pigments is used.

199
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,233
this is the coating unit.

200
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:54,705
it can hold 350 pounds of pills.

201
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,908
three plastic tubes,
strategically positioned,

202
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,712
will spray the solution
onto the pills in motion.

203
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:06,216
the quantity of dry pills to be
coated is put into the unit.

204
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,664
then the door of the coating
unit is carefully closed.

205
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:27,271
a drum turns inside the unit,
tumbling the pills.

206
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,875
then nozzles spray the solution
in the form of a mist

207
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,410
that quickly dries,

208
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,846
preventing the pills from
sticking to one another.

209
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:41,284
this spraying operation
lasts 40 minutes.

210
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,219
here we can compare pills.

211
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,822
on the left are those made
only of powder,

212
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,759
while on the right
are the spray-coated ones.

213
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,997
the finished pills move down
a chute to enter a counter

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,966
prior to filling bottles.

215
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,636
they are lined up in grooves
to make filling easier.

216
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,710
the quantity of pills
to be placed into bottles

217
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:11,314
is controlled by this automated
unit connected to the counter.

218
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,585
in this instance, 500 pills
are poured into each bottle.

219
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,587
this plant also makes capsules

220
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,257
where the ingredient
is not crushed,

221
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,060
but encapsulated
in a gelatin casing.

222
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,330
the distributor places the two
halves of the capsules

223
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,799
in the proper position
for filling,

224
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,668
with the wider half
situated above.

225
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,538
the top and the bottom portions
of the capsule are separated.

226
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,242
the lower half is then filled
with powder.

227
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,546
when well-filled,

228
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,616
the two halves of the capsule
are joined together.

229
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:52,656
the completed capsules are then
ejected from the filling unit.

230
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,559
then, via centrifugal force,

231
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,395
they are positioned
for the packaging process.

232
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,570
the weight of each capsule
is verified by this counter.

233
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,840
each capsule must have
the precise weight.

234
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,578
the final step is packaging.

235
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,914
a sheet of transparent pvc
is heat-embossed,

236
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,450
forming an impression
to receive capsules.

237
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,186
then a preglued
aluminum foil sheet

238
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,790
is adhered to the back side,
sealing everything in.

239
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,928
this plant turns out millions of
pills and capsules every year.

240
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:43,073
narrator:
ever since marco polo brought
the noodle back from china

241
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,208
some 700 years ago,

242
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:50,013
pasta has earned its place
on tables around the world.

243
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,616
pasta comes in an array
of shapes and sizes,

244
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,819
like the diehard pasta lovers

245
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,522
who just can't seem
to get enough.

246
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,697
pasta is actually chinese
in origin.

247
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,967
when marco polo returned
to venice in 1295

248
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,503
after spending 24 years
in the far east,

249
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,773
he brought back with him
chinese pasta noodles.

250
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,111
pasta became popular so quickly
that by the 15th century,

251
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,714
it occupied a prime position
in italian cooking.

252
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,918
in this same era, commercial
production began in naples.

253
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,321
italians today favor macaronis
and raviolis

254
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,124
with garlic and cheese.

255
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,735
pastas are generally made
from semolina and water.

256
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,472
these silos contain
more than 33 tons of semolina,

257
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,640
derived from durum wheat.

258
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,879
the semolina heads toward
the high-speed premixer,

259
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,081
where it will be vigorously
mixed with water

260
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,816
for 5 to 10 seconds.

261
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,151
this machine can treat

262
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,888
between one and two tons
of semolina per hour.

263
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,691
the dough is extracted
from the premixer

264
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,228
and falls into a first-blade
mixer open to the air.

265
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,231
then the dough goes
into this vacuum-blade mixer.

266
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:18,101
the mix is now ready to go
through the brass molds.

267
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:22,305
here's a spaghetti mold
and a mold for mafalda --

268
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,707
very narrow lasagna.

269
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,179
here are molds used to make
lined shells...

270
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,448
and stars for soups...

271
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,317
as well as cresto di gallo.

272
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,789
the dough is injected
into the mold under pressure.

273
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,661
this rotating blade machine cuts
some 12,000 rotinis per minute.

274
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,662
that's 720,000 per hour.

275
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,334
with the dough being still quite
fresh, the rotinis are soft.

276
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,171
they will dry somewhat
on this plate.

277
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,475
now we move to the lasagnas.

278
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,811
the dough goes
through this brass mold,

279
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,982
and the strips of fresh dough,
42 inches long,

280
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:10,153
are placed on these sticks
to dry at 150 degrees.

281
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:15,025
they dry vertically so as to
retain their nice, flat shape.

282
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,366
after drying for 15 hours,

283
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,635
the strips are then cut
in four --

284
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:30,439
thus making four strips
measuring about 10 inches each.

285
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,910
to minimize losses and make
cutting the dry lasagna easier,

286
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,045
scissors trim the dough pieces

287
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,648
into equal lengths
on the sticks.

288
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:42,152
the long lasagna-drying process
begins.

289
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,592
once dry, the lengths
of lasagnas are finally cut.

290
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,993
they're now ready for packaging.

291
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,596
to make some
of the other pastas,

292
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,532
the mix has to be worked
a bit more

293
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,001
in order for it to have
the required shape.

294
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,802
the dough goes through
this roller,

295
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,339
which gives it
the desired thickness.

296
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,476
and now butterflies are formed.

297
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,413
this mold cuts 7,500 of them
a minute

298
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,883
for a total of 450,000 an hour.

299
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,019
the sheet of dough
is two feet wide.

300
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,522
it is produced
in a steady stream

301
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,892
and goes right
to the cutting mold.

302
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,030
the butterflies fall onto
this conveyor to dry somewhat.

303
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,832
then they head toward
the next production step.

304
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,368
certain short pastas,

305
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,037
such as these butterflies
and fusillis,

306
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,641
have to be dried, so they're
then put into this full dryer.

307
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,045
coming out of the dryer,

308
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,115
the pastas are hard
and ready for packaging.

309
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:50,053
here we see the ever-popular
spaghettis being made.

310
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,690
as with lasagnas, spaghettis are
also dried vertically.

311
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,863
now this automated machine
places the spaghettis

312
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,500
onto a cutting table and breaks
them to the proper length.

313
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,405
the spaghettis are now ready
for packaging.

314
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:12,541
exact quantities to be bagged
are determined by computer.

315
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,580
then the spaghettis go gently
down the chute.

316
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,688
the amount of spaghetti
going into each bag

317
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:28,124
is transported and emptied out
by this moving container.

318
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,761
to make filling easier,

319
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,831
the spaghettis are properly
positioned by this chute.

320
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:39,836
in just one minute, this machine
can package 10 8.8-pound bags.

321
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,540
whenever needed, it can handle
up to 60 bags a minute.

322
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,712
pastas are a favorite meal
the world over.

323
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,449
this plant makes
over 100 different products

324
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,519
and every day uses between
60 and 360 tons,

325
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,989
or between 2 and 12 truckloads
of semolina

326
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,425
made from hard wheat.

327
