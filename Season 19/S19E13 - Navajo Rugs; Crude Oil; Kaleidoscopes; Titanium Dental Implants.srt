00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:08,241
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,121
     narrator: the space pen    
   can write in zero gravity,   

4
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,457
          which is why          
    astronauts have used it.    

5
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,794
   it also writes underwater,   
    in extreme heat or cold,    

6
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,329
    or when held upside down.   

7
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:07,866
   all this is possible due to  
   the pen's ingenious design   

8
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:12,004
     that keeps ink flowing     
 toward the tip no matter what. 

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,943
       the space pen's ink      
  is pressurized with nitrogen, 

10
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,146
 so, unlike ordinary ballpoints,

11
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,616
   it doesn't rely on gravity   
     to flow toward the tip.    

12
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,952
        invented in 1966,       

13
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:29,955
  the pen first went into space 
  with the apollo 7 astronauts. 

14
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,358
     the pen's writing point    
           starts out           

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,561
as an 3/10 of an inch long block
       of stainless steel.      

16
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,231
  it passes through more than   
  a dozen machining operations  

17
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,433
    that progressively shape    
            a point,            

18
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,435
then bore a hole through the tip

19
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,238
        to form a pocket        
   for the carbide steel ball.  

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,307
  that makes this a ballpoint.  

21
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,110
    the last station inserts    
            the ball            

22
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,046
      and curves the edges      
      of the pocket inward      

23
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:58,651
  so that the ball is locked in 
  yet can rotate to spread ink. 

24
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:02,521
 the replaceable ink cartridge, 
       called the refill,       

25
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,191
 begins as an empty brass tube. 

26
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:08,460
  this assembly machine inserts 
      a white plastic ball      

27
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,731
        into the back end       

28
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,001
          then pumps in         
       half a gram of ink.      

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,071
         the white ball         
      is called the float.      

30
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:22,341
  its job is to follow the ink  
         down the tube,         

31
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,745
   moving residual ink forward  
        toward the point.       

32
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:29,148
    next, the machine inserts   
        the writing point       

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,349
      into the opposite end     
          of the tube,          

34
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,018
     then it crimps the end     

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,222
   to ensure the writing point  
         can't dislodge.        

36
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,693
      back to the other end     
        of the tube now.        

37
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,963
       the machine applies      
       a bit of sealant...      

38
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,368
       ...injects nitrogen      
    to pressurize the refill,   

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,906
       then caps the tube       
    with a hollow brass plug.   

40
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:57,242
        nitrogen is ideal       
        for pressurizing        

41
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,844
    because it's an inert gas   

42
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,881
        that doesn't harm       
the refill tube or its contents.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,387
    this demonstration shows    

44
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,158
  how the pressurized nitrogen  
      forces the ink flow.      

45
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,732
 after subjecting each and every
    refill to a writing test    

46
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,200
     and washing the surface    

47
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:25,137
   to remove traces of machine  
  lubricant and other residues, 

48
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,606
  a printer applies the company 
  name and product information  

49
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,742
         on the refill.         

50
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:32,744
    certain space pen models    
           have a cap           

51
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,481
         that fits over         
       the writing point.       

52
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,415
   a feeder places a brass cap  

53
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,487
          on each spoke         
  of the cap assembly machine,  

54
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,158
    which then pushes the cap   
into position to receive a clip.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
      the clip is stamped       
      out of spring steel,      

56
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,162
    a fairly flexible metal.    

57
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:54,567
it's chrome-plated for corrosion
   resistance and aesthetics.   

58
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,369
       the machine drives       
        the clip's teeth        

59
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,571
  through the wall of the cap,  

60
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,107
      then curls them back      
 toward the inside of the wall, 

61
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,243
  locking the clip in position. 

62
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,248
     to prepare the two-part    
     brass body of the pen,     

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,185
 a feeder drops the bottom part,
       called the barrel,       

64
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,989
         onto each spoke        
 of the barrel assembly machine.

65
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,658
 to straighten the writing end, 

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,994
       the machine inserts      
   a brass reinforcement piece  

67
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,929
      called the nose tip.      

68
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,997
     it then crimps the end,    

69
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,200
      flaring the nose tip      
        inside the barrel       

70
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,936
    so that it becomes wider    
    than the barrel opening     

71
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,471
  and therefore can't slip out. 

72
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,943
 this model has a chrome-plated 
  brass body and clipless cap.  

73
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,145
  to begin assembling the pen,  

74
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,948
    workers place the barrel    
        in a foam holder,       

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,218
         insert a spring        
 to keep the refill in position,

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,688
    then a threaded connector   
         made of brass.         

77
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,691
     the barrel goes through    
           a machine,           

78
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,027
           which puts           
    a silicone rubber o-ring    

79
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,629
 on the top edge of the barrel. 

80
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,965
   and now the final assembly.  

81
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,634
       they place a refill      
         in the barrel,         

82
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,372
      insert the connector      
 into the top half of the body, 

83
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:11,110
  then, with an electric motor, 
   thread the parts together.   

84
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:14,980
      after placing the cap     
 open-side up in a foam holder, 

85
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,649
      they insert the pen.      

86
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,918
        the o-ring holds        
        the cap in place.       

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,789
     the original space pen,    
      still in production,      

88
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,658
    has a push button on top    
     to push out the refill     

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,994
     and another on the side    
         to retract it.         

90
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,664
     this demonstration pen     
     has a cutaway section      

91
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,599
   to show the inner workings.  

92
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:39,404
      all space pen models      
     can write underwater...    

93
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,808
      and in zero gravity.      

94
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,914
they also work in freezing cold,
 intense heat, and upside down. 

95
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,166
 narrator: a reef aquarium takes
     underwater exploration     

96
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,968
    to a whole new sea level.   

97
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,772
  it's a mini coral reef system 
   re-created in a glass tank.  

98
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,908
installed in a home or business,

99
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,575
  a reef aquarium allows people 

100
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,844
           to see life          
    on the bottom of the sea    

101
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,982
   without donning a wet suit   
         and a snorkel.         

102
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,720
         a reef aquarium        

103
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:30,990
     is a living, breathing,    
     and growing ecosystem.     

104
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,391
    along with tropical fish,   

105
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,326
    it has spectacular coral    

106
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,994
 and more low-profile organisms 

107
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:40,131
       like crab, shrimp,       
   and tiny aquatic creatures.  

108
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,136
   all these organisms act as   
 a biological filtration system 

109
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,071
   for the water in the tank.   

110
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,541
         they supplement        
the biological filtration system

111
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,144
         with mechanical        
       and chemical ones.       

112
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,613
      the assembler starts      
          with the pump         

113
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,215
  that recirculates the water.  

114
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,019
    he installs it in a tank    
    under the display tank.     

115
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,888
 this tank is known as the sump.

116
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,558
  he places the protein skimmer 
  in the sump beside the pump.  

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,561
  this unit injects air bubbles 
         into the water         

118
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,296
   to remove organic compounds  

119
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,966
      before they decompose     
        and become waste.       

120
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,302
   he adds a u.v. sterilizer.   

121
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,904
  it has a high-intensity light 

122
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,906
     that will be activated     
           when needed          

123
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:27,179
 to kill free-floating bacteria,
      parasites, and algae.     

124
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,382
       next, he introduces      
       the media reactor.       

125
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,986
this cylindrical device contains
      both activated carbon     

126
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,121
  and an aluminum-based media.  

127
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,591
   these materials will absorb  
     fish-waste by-products,    

128
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,193
      thereby removing them     
         from the water.        

129
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,064
with the mechanical and chemical
        filters in place,       

130
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,866
         he now moves on        
      to the display tank.      

131
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,403
   he spreads real ocean sand   
         on the bottom.         

132
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,671
   this sand will be a habitat  

133
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,341
    for some of the bacteria    
       and other organisms      

134
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,945
      that will aid in the      
  biological filtering process. 

135
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,418
        he selects rocks        
       from a supply tank       

136
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,821
       and transfers them       
        to the aquarium.        

137
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,222
       the rocks are home       

138
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:14,226
  to numerous algae, bacteria,  
    and small invertebrates.    

139
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,227
this makes them the central part

140
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,531
        of the aquarium's       
  biological filtering system.  

141
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,505
         he now prepares        
        the ocean potion,       

142
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,108
    adding synthetic sea salt   
            to water.           

143
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,245
   a pump circulates the water  

144
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,982
      as the salt dissolves     
   over a period of 24 hours.   

145
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,517
      he presses a switch,      

146
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,454
and the premix of water and salt
      flows into the tank.      

147
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,056
 this water now needs to mature.

148
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,725
       it will take weeks       

149
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:51,730
 for tiny aquatic creatures to  
 begin to thrive in this water. 

150
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,332
        during this time,       

151
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:58,070
 the filtering equipment in the 
 pump below helps keep it clean.

152
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,205
  the protein skimmer foams up  

153
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,275
     as the water constantly    
     circulates through it.     

154
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,677
    after about three weeks,    

155
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,881
 there are enough microorganisms
          in the water.         

156
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,483
 it's ready for coral and fish. 

157
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,487
  these corals have been grown  
        on an ocean farm        

158
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,924
  and kept in this holding tank 
      for this very moment.     

159
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,496
     each coral is composed     
    of tiny, fragile animals    

160
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,231
      called coral polyps.      

161
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,434
      they are essentially      
        little colonies.        

162
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,771
   as the aquarium technician   
      makes his selections,     

163
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:37,042
 he considers how the coral will
 adapt to light and water motion

164
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:41,847
  and how compatible the corals 
    will be with one another.   

165
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:46,184
some corals are very territorial
     and may release toxins     

166
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:50,189
   when they come into contact  
       with other corals.       

167
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,392
    he leaves a lot of space    
       between the corals       

168
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:56,128
   to give them room to grow.   

169
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,934
       allowed to thrive,       
    some will triple in size.   

170
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,203
     he now introduces fish.    

171
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:07,473
   clearly, this aquarium has   
   all the comforts of home.    

172
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,413
  he installs a lighting system 
            overhead            

173
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,282
     that mimics ocean light    
  at different times of day --  

174
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,686
  sunrise, daytime, and sunset. 

175
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,155
        for the creatures       
     in this reef aquarium,     

176
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,724
  light is a source of energy.  

177
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,495
     with the reef aquarium     
          now complete,         

178
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,231
     the monitoring begins.     

179
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,699
 he'll test the water chemistry 
            regularly           

180
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,969
 to ensure the right environment
       is being achieved.       

181
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,506
  the activity of the fish and  
 coral will be under observation

182
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,775
           to confirm           
      this mini-reef system     

183
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,945
           is becoming          
  a thriving marine community.  

184
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:53,051
    only then will this reef    
 aquarium be ready to go public.

185
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,187
  so much more than a fishbowl, 

186
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:58,122
    the reef aquarium brings    
    the wonders of the ocean    

187
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,159
         to the surface.        

188
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,544
            narrator:           
   a central part of arranging  
      a loved one's funeral     

189
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,345
      is choosing a casket.     

190
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,415
  this is often an emotionally  
       difficult decision,      

191
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,685
         as it forces us        
to face the reality of the loss.

192
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,289
 caskets are most commonly made 
     of either wood or metal    

193
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,959
       and range in style       
   from understated to ornate.  

194
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,164
there are two styles of caskets.

195
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,833
     full-couch models have     
        an undivided top        

196
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,570
      to show the deceased      
        from head to toe.       

197
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,239
   perfection-cut models have   
           a split-top          

198
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:50,308
      to show the deceased      
     only from the waist up.    

199
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,644
this factory makes metal caskets

200
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,979
           constructed          
      from sheets of steel.     

201
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:59,451
 to form the top, workers insert
      a sheet into a press.     

202
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,655
  a die inside draws the metal  
      into a paneled shape.     

203
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,992
          this requires         
   900 tons of pulling force,   

204
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:11,863
 the equivalent of hoisting 27  
 fully loaded tractor trailers. 

205
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,533
    after trimming the edges,   

206
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:18,337
  workers insert the panel into 
  an automated folding machine. 

207
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,342
    first, the machine bends    
    both long sides upward --   

208
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:26,278
  two bends of 90 degrees each. 

209
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:32,284
      second, it bends both     
short sides upward the same way.

210
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,094
       then, workers weld       
       the corner seams.        

211
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,497
   they also assemble and weld  

212
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:50,234
     the casket's side, end,    
  and reinforce bottom panels.  

213
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,370
      these two were shaped     
          in the press          

214
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,439
            but with            
    a different type of die,    

215
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:59,811
which stamps, rather than draws,
the steel to the required shape.

216
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:08,720
  for a perfection-cut casket,  
    they saw the top in half,   

217
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,923
 then weld steel to the cut end,

218
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:16,461
   forming a header to give it  
     a neatly-finished look.    

219
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,597
    an automated belt grinds    
       all the welds flat       

220
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,000
   to create a smooth finish.   

221
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,076
 after a cleaning, all the parts
     travel through a booth     

222
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,947
 inside which 20 automated spray
 guns coat them in powder paint.

223
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:41,152
 an electrical charge draws the 
powder particles onto the steel,

224
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,288
            ensuring            
    a thorough and even coat,   

225
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,426
  which a giant oven then bakes 
         for 20 minutes.        

226
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,227
     once the surface cools,    

227
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:53,732
workers inspect the paint finish
   to make sure it's flawless.  

228
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,907
   workers apply hot-melt glue  
         on the inside,         

229
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,909
           along where          
   the bottom and sides meet.   

230
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,113
       this makes the body      
    of the casket watertight.   

231
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:12,651
  and they conduct a water test 
          to make sure.         

232
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,065
 the casket is lined with crepe,

233
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,466
       a synthetic fabric       

234
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,536
        which is formable       
    when you apply high heat.   

235
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,740
 this specially-designed machine
 heats the material with an iron

236
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,276
  as serrated wheels gather it  
     into decorative pleats     

237
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,678
       known as shirring.       

238
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,649
 the high heat forms the fabric 
   to this shape permanently.   

239
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,859
 sewers cut and sew the shirred 
 fabric into lining components. 

240
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,899
    meanwhile, workers mount    
  the casket's steel hardware,  

241
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,633
    either stationary handles   

242
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,303
      or swing bar handles,     
          which pivot.          

243
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,972
   they place a rubber gasket   
       around the top edge      

244
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,910
     to ensure a proper seal    
     when the top is closed.    

245
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,378
    then, they mount the top.   

246
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,716
      the gasket has holes      
      for the steel hinges.     

247
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,050
         by this point,         

248
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,187
    they've already attached    
   most of the interior fabric  

249
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,924
      over an inner lining      
    of corrugated cardboard.    

250
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,993
          now it's time         
    to install the steel bed,   

251
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,596
    using an expandable rod.    

252
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,665
 the bed's height is adjustable,

253
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,667
   enabling funeral directors   
     to elevate the deceased    

254
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,070
       for easier viewing.      

255
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:43,141
    a mattress pad and sheet    
    go on the top of the bed.   

256
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:47,078
        clips on each end       
       hold them in place.      

257
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,281
a pillow completes the interior.

258
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,685
     every casket undergoes     
  a thorough final inspection,  

259
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,423
    then it's shipped to the    
  funeral home that ordered it. 

260
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:02,494
   the funeral home typically   
 displays several sample pieces 

261
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,763
        showing the range       
  of styles, colors, hardware,  

262
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:10,302
  and fabric options available  
    for a loved one's casket.   

263
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,586
 narrator: in the cycling world,

264
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,456
     carbon composite wheels    
    are the wheels of change.   

265
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,325
 they can weigh half the amount 
  of traditional metal wheels,  

266
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,662
   so the cyclists can pick up  
     speed with less effort.    

267
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,266
     carbon wheels also cost    
many times more than metal ones,

268
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,703
    so your wallet will also    
      be more lightweight.      

269
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,942
       flatter and thinner      
        than metal ones,        

270
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,944
         these high-tech        
       carbon bike wheels       

271
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,546
 are designed to take advantage 

272
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,614
        of carbon fiber's       
     unique characteristics     

273
00:16:56,616 --> 00:17:00,685
and support the cyclist's weight
          efficiently.          

274
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,090
      they start by cutting     
   carbon fiber into patterns.  

275
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,760
       these arcs are for       
      half of a side wheel.     

276
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,830
 the technician layers them onto
 a band of fiberglass in a mold.

277
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,301
   the fiberglass will provide  
    a good breaking surface.    

278
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:20,438
  he drapes a piece of nonstick 
   plastic film over the mold   

279
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,241
            and adds            
    a silicone pressure pad.    

280
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,777
        he stacks several       
  carbon-filled sidewall molds, 

281
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,382
    each with a silicone pad    
        and plastic film.       

282
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,050
      he wraps a heater pad     
    and a plastic vacuum bag    

283
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,921
        around the stack        
    and activates the vacuum.   

284
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,256
      it sucks out the air      

285
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,793
to pull the melting carbon fiber
   to the shape of the molds.   

286
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,062
     he adds an air bladder     
        and metal plate.        

287
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,931
   this applies more pressure   

288
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,602
 as the carbon fiber solidifies 
     into a sidewall shape.     

289
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:54,672
   the next technician layers   
  material for the wheel rims.  

290
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,008
           he inserts           
     strips of carbon fiber     

291
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,876
  into a long and narrow mold,  

292
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,747
  pushing it into the crevasses 
      with a teflon wheel.      

293
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,085
   he applies strips of carbon  
 to the sides for reinforcement.

294
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,088
             he adds            
   a resin-based film adhesive  

295
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,024
 followed by more carbon fiber. 

296
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,895
     using a kind of wedge,     
 he again puts on the pressure, 

297
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:20,297
  causing the carbon fiber and  
film adhesive to stick together.

298
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,102
  he transfers the long layers  
        to a round mold.        

299
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,104
     as with the sidewalls,     

300
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,841
he heats the rims under pressure
        to set the shape.       

301
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,378
    he'll get five wheel rims   
      out of this one tool.     

302
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,581
   the next technician shapes   
       carbon-fiber layers      

303
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,650
      around a metal shaft      

304
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:43,455
       and flares them out      
to form the wheel's hub flanges.

305
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,323
    she smoothes the creases,   

306
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,526
          then prepares         
 for the vacuum pressure curing,

307
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,996
         placing a piece        
       of nonstick plastic      

308
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:54,532
 and a silicone mandrel assembly
             on top.            

309
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:59,471
     she stacks the flanges     
 and slides a tube around them. 

310
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,742
       she bolts on a lid.      

311
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,877
     then it's into an oven     

312
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,547
     to bake under pressure     
     for about four hours.      

313
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,017
         this transforms        
 each patchwork of carbon fiber 

314
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,355
     into a solid, seamless     
       bike wheel flange.       

315
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,358
 they'll now assemble the wheel.

316
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,695
     the technician inserts     
    flat carbon-fiber spokes    

317
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:27,098
           into holes           
   in one half of a sidewall.   

318
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,270
 adhesive and carbon fiber will 
bond the spokes to the sidewall.

319
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,640
 he places a carbon-fiber patch 

320
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,376
where the end of the spoke meets
          the sidewall          

321
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,978
       and tapes it there.      

322
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,447
with all the spokes in position,

323
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:45,783
        he lowers the lid       
and applies mechanical pressure.

324
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,720
the spokes bond to the sidewall,
   and it's ready for the rim.  

325
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,590
with the help of a locating pin,

326
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,660
the technician positions the rim
        on the sidewall.        

327
00:19:55,662 --> 00:20:00,799
 he also uses this carbon-fiber 
   ring as an alignment tool.   

328
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,867
            he places           
    the other sidewall half,    

329
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,203
  with spokes attached, on top. 

330
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:10,341
   the geometry is precise for  
maximum strength and resilience.

331
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,943
 after another compressed bake, 

332
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,547
       he applies adhesive      
    to the ends of the spokes   

333
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,483
        and attaches them       
         to hub flanges.        

334
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:22,887
    he places a metal spacer    
 between the two flanges for now

335
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,556
      and tapes the spokes      

336
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,158
       to prevent adhesive      
  from trickling down onto them 

337
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,761
   during the heating process.  

338
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:33,698
 he adds a piece of release film
  and a silicone pressure pad.  

339
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,901
     he clips metal splints     
   to the carbon-fiber spokes   

340
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,104
         to support them        
        through the cure.       

341
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:42,373
    and, with the spokes now    
 pressure-bonded to the flanges,

342
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,509
   it's time for fine-tuning.   

343
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,644
      the technician locks      
         the bike wheel         

344
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:50,582
   in a fixture that stretches  
      the spokes slightly.      

345
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,319
   this creates the necessary   
      tension and rigidity.     

346
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,321
      once he's satisfied       
      with the tensioning,      

347
00:20:56,323 --> 00:21:01,459
    he applies resin adhesive   
 through a hole in a hub flange.

348
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,395
      two hours in an oven      
      sets the tensioning,      

349
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:08,199
    and he removes the wheel    
        from the fixture.       

350
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:12,069
       after cleaning and       
  the application of graphics,  

351
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,740
   the carbon-fiber bike wheel  
    just needs a rubber tire,   

352
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,476
and it's ready to go for a spin.

353
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,625
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,
