00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:54,186
            narrator:           
a rally car is a compact vehicle

2
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,787
 that's had a radical makeover. 

3
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,792
 it's been stripped to the steel
  core and completely rebuilt.  

4
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:03,795
 international rally regulations
       govern the process.      

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,998
           in the end,          
  that efficient little vehicle 

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,634
             becomes            
  a lean, mean racing machine.  

7
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,839
    fresh out of the factory,   

8
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,207
        this compact car        

9
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,610
  is about to be ripped apart   
  and put back together again.  

10
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,347
           the rebuild          
     will pump up the power     

11
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,215
 and transform a quiet road car 

12
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,752
    into a vehicle that roars   
  on the rally racing circuit.  

13
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,356
  bold graphics will also make  
  this compact car look fierce. 

14
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,357
   as they dismantle the car,   

15
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,161
they get rid of some superfluous
       brackets and panels      

16
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,296
         to shed weight.        

17
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,964
    they blast off the paint.   

18
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,566
         then they weld         
 a tubular steel roll cage to it

19
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,436
      to protect the driver     
          and co-driver         

20
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,638
     in a rollover or crash.    

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,307
          the roll cage         
    also stiffens the chassis   

22
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,709
       for better handling      
         on hard turns.         

23
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,846
they widen the back end slightly

24
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,648
    to accommodate an upgrade   
    to a 4-wheel transmission   

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,585
     and a larger fuel tank.    

26
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:04,056
     then they paint primer     
  onto the modified body shell. 

27
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,926
        they're now ready       
   for the rear transmission.   

28
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:11,397
     this will convert this     
  compact car to 4-wheel drive. 

29
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,799
      the technician bolts      
        the transmission        

30
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,869
    to the rear floor panel.    

31
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,339
  upgrading from 2-wheel drive  
 to 4-wheel drive adds traction 

32
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,010
  and allows the car to handle  
         more precisely.        

33
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,148
         now the seats.         

34
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,618
   they're individual survival  
   cells made of carbon fiber,  

35
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,020
   a virtually indestructible   
            material.           

36
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,622
   it's also extremely light,   

37
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,557
      and this helps offset     
        the extra weight        

38
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,628
 added by the rear transmission 
         and roll cage.         

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,765
the new dashboard fascia is made
    of lightweight fiberglass   

40
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,767
           and covered          
      with a velvety fabric     

41
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:50,369
            to block            
    the reflection of light.    

42
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,371
  with the dashboard in place,  

43
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,775
the car gets the steering column
           and wheel.           

44
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:58,577
      the car is now ready      
   for the fiberglass bumper.   

45
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,981
  it's been redesigned slightly 
   to accommodate new fenders   

46
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:04,450
         that are flared        
        for bigger tires.       

47
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:07,519
         the technician         
    then equips the rally car   

48
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,255
     with heavy-duty dampers    

49
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,523
       to absorb the shock      
       of high-speed bumps      

50
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,459
      on the rally course.      

51
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,663
  he slides the stiff spherical 
   bearings into the car shell  

52
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,931
        and secures them.       

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,802
      he links the dampers      
       and the driveshaft       

54
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,805
       to the hub carrier       
   and bolts them into place.   

55
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,943
   he inserts brake pads into   
  lightweight aluminum calipers 

56
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,545
 and mounts them to the rotors. 

57
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,349
  this braking system is extra  
  large for serious friction,   

58
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:41,420
  allowing the rally car to be  
 slowed efficiently when needed.

59
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,224
  using a crane, they now lift  
  the engine into the chassis.  

60
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,960
      this is the original      
        1.6-liter engine,       

61
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:52,164
     but seriously ramped up    
      to boost performance.     

62
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,700
        they've upgraded        
   the pistons and camshafts,   

63
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,636
       among other things,      
    and added a turbocharger.   

64
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,638
           this takes           
     the compact-car engine     

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,642
   from 90 horsepower to 300.   

66
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,313
  instead of a metal fuel tank, 
   they install a rubber one.   

67
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,314
    it's pliable and expands,   

68
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,517
    so it's unlikely to split   
      or crack in a crash.      

69
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,788
    the rubber fuel cell fits   
perfectly under the trunk floor.

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,457
     strapped to that floor     
    is this little tool kit.    

71
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,326
  they've lightened these tools 

72
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,729
        by drilling holes       
        into the handles.       

73
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:28,334
  as the race heats up, so will 
   the engine and its fluids.   

74
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,936
      they custom-designed      
     this u-shaped radiator     

75
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,272
             to keep            
  the power-steering oil cool.  

76
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:37,076
   they tie it to the front of  
 the supersized engine radiator.

77
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,545
    without this substantial    
        radiator system,        

78
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,479
     overheating could kill     
           the engine,          

79
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,350
   and that would be the end    
   of the rally for this car.   

80
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,485
 the mechanics of the rally car 

81
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,021
          have now been         
       completely rebuilt.      

82
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,756
    they now install windows.   

83
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,291
   they use double-sided tape   

84
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,894
  to bind the rear side windows 
           to the car.          

85
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:57,495
    taping the windows means    

86
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,899
  they can be easily kicked out 
  in the event of an accident.  

87
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:03,501
      the windows are made      
    of shatterproof plastic.    

88
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,304
      so there shouldn't be     
       any cuts or scrapes      

89
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:09,041
     when busting them out.     

90
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,243
  instead of painting the car,  

91
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,846
     they glue on graphics      
     from bumper to bumper.     

92
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,181
      the graphics are made     
         of plastic film        

93
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,917
that is much lighter than paint.

94
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,987
 the crew saves about 11 pounds 
 by not painting the rally car. 

95
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:25,591
saving weight and redistributing
     it for better handling,    

96
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,460
         while adhering         
  to tight weight regulations,  

97
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,529
 is just part of the challenge. 

98
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,798
        and a good finish       
       in the rebuild shop      

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,569
  could lead to a strong finish 
          in the rally.         

100
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,421
   narrator: british pork pie   

101
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,890
     is made of chopped pork    
         and pork jelly         

102
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,625
 nestled inside a crust pastry. 

103
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:03,095
 mass-produced versions contain 
  cured pork in a soft pastry.  

104
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:07,499
    premium pies are handmade   
    with fresh, uncured pork    

105
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,635
   inside a pastry that's hard  
    and crisp on the outside,   

106
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,238
       soft on the inside.      

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,642
      among the best-known      
 premium varieties of pork pies 

108
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,310
       is melton mowbray,       

109
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,045
   named after an english town  

110
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,515
 which has produced this british
  snack since the 19th century. 

111
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,384
   only manufacturers situated  

112
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,519
     within a defined radius    
           of the town          

113
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,722
 can legally call their product 
    melton mowbray pork pie.    

114
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,659
     and they have to follow    
     the traditional recipe,    

115
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,662
   which begins with blending   
        hard bread flour.       

116
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,965
      then workers put lard     
   into a pot of cold water...  

117
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,736
   ...sprinkle with sea salt,   

118
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:49,408
 then bring the water to a fast 
   boil, dissolving the lard.   

119
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,677
 then they add this hot mixture 
          to the flour.         

120
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,747
  they blend for a few minutes  

121
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:58,283
   until the ingredients form   
   a medium-soft golden dough.  

122
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,753
        unlike dough made       
        with cold water,        

123
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,487
  which bakes soft throughout,  

124
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,224
      hot-water dough bakes     
      hard on the surface,      

125
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,259
        but soft within.        

126
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,097
 they roll the dough into balls 

127
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,800
        of approximately        
      half a pound each...      

128
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,236
...then roll half the balls flat

129
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,206
          into a layer          
 roughly 2/10 of an inch thick. 

130
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:27,513
   with a round pastry cutter,  
       they slice circles.      

131
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,649
   each one will be a pie top,  
          called a lid.         

132
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,318
      the other dough balls     
        will later become       

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,721
      the base of the pie,      
        called the case.        

134
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:39,057
     the pie filling is made    
    from fresh pork shoulder,   

135
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,126
   white pepper, and sea salt.  

136
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,662
    they prepare the filling    
        in small batches        

137
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,132
   in order to better control   
the distribution of ingredients.

138
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,535
     after cutting the pork     
       into small chunks,       

139
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,803
          they sprinkle         
     with salt and pepper...    

140
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,006
         mix by hand...         

141
00:07:56,544 --> 00:08:00,012
...then form balls the same size
      as the pastry balls.      

142
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,618
      in the assembly area,     

143
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,022
  workers lay a plastic sheet   
  over the hoop of a pie press  

144
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,158
      to prevent the dough      
         from sticking.         

145
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,693
     they put a pastry ball     
           in the hoop          

146
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,196
          and cover it          
      with another sheet...     

147
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,202
...then plunge a round metal die
into the hoop to form the case. 

148
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
          now they drop         
       a pork ball inside,      

149
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:33,445
  pushing it down to force out  
    some of the trapped air.    

150
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,249
 they brush water onto the edge 
 of the case to make it sticky. 

151
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,385
then they apply the lid, lightly
    thumb-pressing all around   

152
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:43,255
          to adhere it          
 to the sticky edge of the case.

153
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,725
            then with           
     a different hand press,    

154
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:50,495
    they score the perimeter    
          of the pie...         

155
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,265
  and gently run a wooden block 
         across the top.        

156
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,066
  this removes the excess dough 

157
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,136
        without unsealing       
       or ripping the pie.      

158
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,206
a ventilation hole in the middle
  lets just enough steam escape 

159
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,841
       to prevent pressure      

160
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,676
        from building up        
      and bursting the lid.     

161
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,013
     the steam that remains     
    helps tenderize the pork.   

162
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,149
         a pie decorator        
     crimps the edge inward.    

163
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,152
        then the pies go        
       onto a baking sheet      

164
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,687
  and into the oven for an hour 

165
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,889
          at just under         
     400 degrees fahrenheit.    

166
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,226
    earlier, workers prepared   
         the pork jelly         

167
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,229
      by boiling pigs' feet     
   in a large pot of water...   

168
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,298
  then simmering for nine hours 

169
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,834
 to release the natural gelatin 
         from the bones.        

170
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,973
         now they strain        
       the pot's contents       

171
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,209
 to isolate this natural jelly. 

172
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,983
  they've timed this perfectly  
 so that the jelly is still warm

173
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,654
          when the pies         
      come out of the oven.     

174
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:52,925
when they do, their pastry crust
       is a golden color.       

175
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:57,396
 the pork, as meat tends to do, 
   has shrunk during cooking,   

176
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,998
      creating empty spaces     
       inside the pastry.       

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,667
      it's into those voids     

178
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,002
     that workers now inject    
       the warm pork jelly      

179
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,538
  until it starts bubbling out  
      the hole at the top.      

180
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,006
    this indicates the jelly    

181
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,476
           has filled           
   all the nooks and crannies.  

182
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:13,145
     the pies go immediately    
          into a fridge         

183
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,480
  set at 43 degrees fahrenheit. 

184
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:19,885
  they remain inside for about  
90 minutes until the jelly sets.

185
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,754
      from now on, the pork     
        will remain moist       

186
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,557
 thanks to this congealed jelly 
         surrounding it.        

187
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,227
       each pie is wrapped      
    in a see-through package    

188
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:30,295
  bearing a "best before" date. 

189
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,566
  kept refrigerated, a pork pie 
  stays fresh for about a week. 

190
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,701
  you take it out of the fridge 

191
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,172
     and let it warm to room    
 temperature before digging in. 

192
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,976
     no self-respecting brit    
     ever warms up pork pie.    

193
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,857
  narrator: a floating fountain 

194
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,393
      adds visual interest      
       to a pond or pool.       

195
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,530
  it continuously shoots water  
       several yards high,      

196
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,599
        producing ribbons       
       of cascading water.      

197
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,869
       a submersible pump       
      generates the effect.     

198
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:14,473
 and all you have to do is just 
  sit back and enjoy the show.  

199
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,812
      a floating fountain       
      is a pleasant sight,      

200
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,347
    but it's also practical.    

201
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,150
   the constant pumping action  
       aerates the water,       

202
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,551
      preventing stagnation     

203
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,588
     that breeds mosquitoes     
    and causes algae growth.    

204
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,694
        production begins       
    with the floatation ring,   

205
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,029
         which they cast        
      a section at a time.      

206
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,632
a worker pours a measured amount
        of plastic powder       

207
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,702
      into the bottom half      
      of a clamshell mold.      

208
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,770
 the mold is attached to an arm 

209
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,508
   that swings it into an oven  
   and rotates it on two axes.  

210
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,309
       the mold heats up.       

211
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,778
        the powder melts        

212
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,548
   and adheres to the walls of  
the mold, forming a hollow part.

213
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,919
       the mold now moves       
      into a cooling zone,      

214
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,522
     where it first rotates     
       in front of a fan,       

215
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,790
     then under a cool spray    
            of water.           

216
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,659
 the constant turning minimizes 

217
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,462
       sagging or buckling      
         in the plastic         

218
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:14,198
    as the hollow part cools    
     and solidifies inside.     

219
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,535
         the mold opens,        
   revealing a quarter section  

220
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:18,202
     of the flotation ring.     

221
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,605
     stainless-steel inserts    
     for attaching it to the    
         other sections         

222
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,108
       have been embedded       
       into the plastic.        

223
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,614
   they now mechanically push   
   the hollow part underwater.  

224
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,615
         this is a test.        

225
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,150
      they pump air into it     

226
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,153
      and check for bubbles     
   that would indicate a hole.  

227
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,556
        the fountain ring       
        must be leakproof       

228
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:41,226
because water will eventually be
    added to it to level it.    

229
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:45,364
       a worker now bolts       
   the four quarters together   

230
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,698
         using brackets         

231
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,268
  and the steel inserts molded  
    into the plastic earlier.   

232
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,906
        next, they focus        
        on the framework        

233
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,708
    for the submersible pump.   

234
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,646
    a mechanical saw cuts the   
 stainless steel parts to size, 

235
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,049
    and a welder pieces them    
            together.           

236
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,985
   another worker now attaches  
     the completed framework    

237
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,320
         to the brackets        

238
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:11,023
   protruding from the bottom   
     of the floatation ring.    

239
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,795
 using a press, they bend steel 
       to create brackets       

240
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,663
 to hold the fountain's lights. 

241
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,733
  they bolt the light brackets  
        to the pump frame       

242
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,737
   in a position to illuminate  
   the upward spray of water.   

243
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,739
           they slide           
    the long, tubular casing    

244
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,274
   for the pump and its motor   

245
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,476
 through brackets on the bottom 
          of the frame.         

246
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,945
        this is the pump.       

247
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,215
      it's open to display      
      the inner workings.       

248
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,817
        those steel disks       
        are the impellers       

249
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,818
  that will force water upward. 

250
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,222
        the next employee       
        applies pvc glue        

251
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,425
       to attach a flange       
      to the pump assembly.     

252
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,960
     the flange will be used    
       to connect the pump      

253
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,628
   to the fountain's plumbing.  

254
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,099
   he now inserts the pump and  
 motor assembly into the casing.

255
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,635
 the motor has been hermetically
    sealed to keep water out.   

256
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,970
    using a special gripper,    

257
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,907
      he pulls the assembly     
  all the way through the tube  

258
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,842
  to complete the installation. 

259
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,245
      he spreads more glue      
         onto the flange        

260
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,181
    and attaches a pvc elbow    

261
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,384
    that links it to the rest   
        of the plumbing.        

262
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,722
       the entire assembly      
        is painted black        

263
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,392
  so the fountain workings will 
  seem to disappear underwater  

264
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:23,362
  when viewed from the surface. 

265
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,401
        with the assembly       
   now flipped right side up,   

266
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:32,137
    they install the lights.    

267
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,340
  then a worker screws a circle 
     of eight brass nozzles     

268
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,210
        onto a pvc base.        

269
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,879
    these nozzles will split    
  the flow of pumped lake water 

270
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:45,083
       into a eight sprays      
 and configure them in a circle.

271
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,420
    he tightens each nozzle     
    to ensure the connection    

272
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,957
   will withstand the powerful  
  and perpetual pumping action. 

273
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,962
  he places the nozzle assembly 
         on the plumbing        

274
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,763
           protruding           
     from the fountain raft     

275
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,768
           and twists           
   the threaded ends together.  

276
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,904
     the connection must be     
        extremely tight.        

277
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,243
    another worker then rolls   
   a sheet of perforated steel  

278
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,111
    to build a tubular screen   
       to filter the water      

279
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,248
   as it flows into the pump.   

280
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,049
    the screen fits perfectly   

281
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,520
 onto the intake end of the pump
         and motor tube.        

282
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,988
   with the floating fountain   
          now complete,         

283
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,858
     it's ready to be wired     
     to the control panel.      

284
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,394
           this panel           
   will be positioned lakeside  

285
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,697
      for onsite activation     
  and programming of the timer. 

286
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:37,535
    the floating fountain is    
    now ready for launching.    

287
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,071
     this particular one is     
        a larger version        

288
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,806
 of the one we saw being built, 

289
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,777
but big or small, it's all about
      going with the flow.      

290
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,026
   narrator: artificial stone   
       is a cast material       

291
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,629
      that looks just like      
     sculpted natural stone.    

292
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,965
  since the early 18th century, 

293
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,634
  manufacturers have cast stone 
            in molds,           

294
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,504
   producing beautiful garden   
    and landscape ornaments,    

295
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,572
             as well            
   as architectural components  

296
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,875
 designed to enhance buildings. 

297
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,314
     classical-style statues    
   and other garden ornaments   

298
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,651
  came into fashion in england  
          in the 1700s.         

299
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,120
          it was trendy         
      for the upper classes     

300
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:33,124
to tour italy and admire ancient
   roman art and architecture.  

301
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,326
         not every noble        
       was wealthy enough       

302
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,396
   to haul home a solid stone   
    antiquity by stagecoach,    

303
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,531
      so english factories      

304
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,968
   began producing facsimiles   
      in artificial stone.      

305
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,474
  the production process today  
    is much like it was then,   

306
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,942
    beginning in the studio,    

307
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,145
     where a sculptor makes     
a plaster model of the ornament.

308
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,282
        this one's a copy       
   of an antique bust of pan,   

309
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:00,484
 the greek mythological figure. 

310
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,088
            they use            
 this intricately detailed model

311
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,756
  to make the production mold.  

312
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,492
    after coating the plaster   
         with a sealer,         

313
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,494
   they cover the entire model  
    with thin strips of clay,   

314
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,231
    making certain divisions    
         between strips         

315
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,233
 to create the production mold's
        various sections.       

316
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,371
    over the clay, they apply   
        six or so layers        

317
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,775
       of fiberglass cloth      
      saturated with resin.     

318
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,976
        the resin cures,        

319
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,245
   producing a 3/10-inch-thick  
      multi-sectioned case      

320
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,782
 around the clay-covered model. 

321
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,184
     next they open the case    
      and remove the clay,      

322
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,120
       which leaves a gap       
       around the model.        

323
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,588
       they close the case      

324
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,925
  and fill that gap with their  
  specially developed rubber.   

325
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,260
     when the rubber cures,     

326
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,863
       they open the case       
      and remove the model,     

327
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,163
     revealing a rubber mold    

328
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,667
   that bears all the model's   
       intricate details.       

329
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,203
    they send this cased mold   
 off to the production facility 

330
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,005
  and put the model in storage  

331
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:59,277
until the rubber mold wears out 
and it's time to pour a new one.

332
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,214
    the artificial stone is a   
natural-looking off-white color.

333
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,884
     it's made of fine sand,    
  white cement, and limestone,  

334
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,487
       plus plasticizers,       
         waterproofers,         

335
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,356
  and a few secret ingredients. 

336
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,426
 the factory adds stone pigments
          into the mix          

337
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:17,095
     to produce terra cotta     
        and other colors.       

338
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,432
  a computer-controlled system  
      feeds the ingredients     

339
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,167
         into the mixer         
  in all the right proportions, 

340
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,970
            then adds           
     a small amount of water    

341
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:29,574
     to activate the cement     
 that binds everything together.

342
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,375
    on the production floor,    

343
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,045
   a caster repeatedly shovels  
     a bit of stone mixture     

344
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,115
   into the fiberglass-encased  
          rubber mold,          

345
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,784
      then, using both hand     
      and pneumatic tools,      

346
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,387
    compacts it in the mold.    

347
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,922
   the quality of the ornament  

348
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,658
         depends greatly        
   on the caster's technique.   

349
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,727
          the trick is          
   to ram enough stone mixture  

350
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,862
   into every nook and cranny   
          of the mold,          

351
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,598
    but not compact too much    
           at a time,           

352
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
   as this mold would produce   

353
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,536
       unattractive layers      
    in the finished ornament.   

354
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,806
    they trowel the open side   
       of the mold by hand      

355
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,708
     and smooth the surface.    

356
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:15,153
  the stone mix takes 24 hours  
    to reach an initial set.    

357
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,022
    then, section by section,   

358
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:20,325
      they unbolt the case      
  and peel off the rubber mold. 

359
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,237
  this may be artificial stone, 

360
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:36,074
 but its surface texture closely
   resembles carved limestone.  

361
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,181
         the final step         
       is a vapor curing.       

362
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,317
        the ornaments go        
    into a chamber overnight.   

363
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,054
    the steam forces moisture   
         into the pores,        

364
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,723
    curing the cement inside.   

365
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:56,661
  this type of artificial stone 
  is called dry cast limestone. 

366
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:59,330
    other ornaments are made    
     of wet cast limestone,     

367
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,666
            a mixture           
     of similar ingredients,    

368
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:06,805
   but in larger particle size  
 and containing much more water.

369
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,941
           because you          
    can embed stainless-steel   
    reinforcement bars in it,   

370
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:13,144
 wet cast is the better material
       for making objects       

371
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,080
     such as garden benches     
     or large fountain bowls    

372
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,682
          that require          
      structural strength.      

373
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,619
      wet cast doesn't have     
        to be vapor-cured       

374
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,222
       because of its high      
         water content.         

375
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,157
    however, unlike dry cast,   

376
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,425
        which is finished       
 when it comes out of the mold, 

377
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,962
            wet cast            
     does require finishing.    

378
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,364
   workers have to grind away   
         excess material        

379
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,234
      that sometimes seeps      
  out of the joints in the mold 

380
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,569
          and hardens.          

381
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,639
      the wet cast surface      
      is smooth and sealed,     

382
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,042
     so it's normally easier    
            to clean.           

383
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:47,979
  dry cast stone, by contrast,  
     has a textured surface     

384
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:51,716
          and weathers          
       to an antique look.
