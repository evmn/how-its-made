00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,221
      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,455
  narrator: mines and quarries  
         use crushers           

4
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,057
  to break down raw material.   

5
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,928
 those raw materials go through 
a vibrating screen to separate  

6
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,930
    the particles by size.      

7
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,066
    the vibrations cause the    
             smaller            
    pieces to fall through      

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,804
  the screen while the larger   
     pieces remain on top.      

9
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,142
   this limestone quarry uses   
      a vibrating screen        

10
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,078
       with three decks.        

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,547
  the top deck filters out the  
        largest stones,         

12
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,349
         which will be          
    used to make concrete.      

13
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,152
    the second deck collects    
       half-inch rocks.         

14
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,955
     they'll be used to make    
            asphalt.            

15
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,692
         the final deck         
gathers the smallest materials  

16
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:36,495
  to product limestone sand.    

17
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,898
        the screen mesh         
   is made from steel wire.     

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,968
  this steel contains carbon,   
    making it more durable      

19
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,771
      than regular steel.       

20
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:50,843
      a pair of wheel dyes      
 crimp it into a wave pattern.  

21
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,312
    the diameter of the wire    
       and crimp pattern        

22
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:57,183
  determine the shape and size  
 of the screen mesh openings.   

23
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:02,988
  workers can change the dyes   
 to crimp different patterns.   

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,225
  the machine cuts the crimped  
  wire to a specific length.    

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,131
 then, workers take the pieces  
        over to a loom.         

26
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,801
 it weaves screens the same way 
 a textile loom weaves cloth.   

27
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,005
   they lay the crimped wires   
          vertically,           

28
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,875
  playing one in between each   
    of the loom's heddles.      

29
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,614
 they line up the crimped wire  

30
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,751
    so that the bottom of one   
              crimp             
  faces the top of the next.    

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,089
   then they weave a straight   
              wire              

32
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,659
      horizontally across       
 the vertically crimped wires.  

33
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,568
     they continue to feed      
    straight wires across.      

34
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,772
       then use the loom        
      to secure each one in     
           position.            

35
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,654
          the vertical          
and horizontal wires interlock  

36
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,389
       to form the mesh.        

37
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,471
  once they've woven a section  
    to the required length,     

38
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,140
 a sheer cuts it off the loom.  

39
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,283
another sheet cuts the section  

40
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,586
       to the customer's        
     requested dimensions.      

41
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,637
     this is the final size     
  of the screen mesh section.   

42
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,376
  next, workers insert one set  
         of the screen          

43
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,179
    into an electromagnetic     
       induction heater.        

44
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,783
   the device evenly generates  
              heat              
       inside the steel.        

45
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,453
    this is critical because    
             heating            
unevenly can weaken the steel.  

46
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,059
   they inset the heated edge   
       in a steel strip         

47
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,461
      mounted in a press.       

48
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,531
   the press clamps the strip   
      over the edge then        

49
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,733
  vents it into a hook strip.   

50
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,806
    they repeat the process     
  on the opposite site side.    

51
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,208
      the two hook strips       
    attach the mesh section     

52
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,710
   to the vibrating screen.     

53
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,286
    the loom can weave many     
    different types of screen   
             mesh.              

54
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,221
this one is made of finer wire  

55
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:53,892
         that's crimped         
    in a different pattern.     

56
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:58,164
   the openings of the screen   
              mesh              
       are larger and more      
          rectangular.          

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,267
    it's designed for a less    
             precise            
       sorting process.         

58
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,246
       for both screens,        

59
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,982
    the weaving and cutting     
    processes are the same.     

60
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,719
     they even use the same     
            technique           
  to attach the hook strips.    

61
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,556
  the only thing that changes   
   is the crimping pattern.     

62
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,794
  next, they connect the hook   
     strips to the vibrating    
            screen.             

63
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,930
  installers lay the sections   
          end-to-end            

64
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,935
    on each of the machine's    
             decks.             

65
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,270
       then they fashion        
the hook strips to the machine  

66
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:42,007
      with tension rails        

67
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,710
     and secure those rails     
       with large bolts.        

68
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,618
  when the mine or quarry needs 
               to               
      change the screening      
          parameters,           

69
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,855
   they simply replace these    
 screens with different ones.   

70
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:13,171
 narrator: whoopie pies are not 
         pies at all.           

71
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,575
   this all-american treat is   
              made              
   of vanilla cream frosting    

72
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:21,246
 sandwiched between two pieces  
   of round chocolate cake.     

73
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,983
        the whoopie pie         
 was invented in new england.   

74
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:26,886
 and today, it is the official  
     state treat of maine.      

75
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,791
   this company adds a modern   
              twist             
        to the classic          

76
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,727
      whoopie pie recipe.       

77
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,262
   in addition to traditional   
    chocolate and vanilla,      

78
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,399
  the company makes four other  
     all-natural flavors.       

79
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,801
        the ingredients         
     are certified vegan,       

80
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,604
 non-gmo, gluten-free, kosher   

81
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,408
            and free            
of many common food allergens.  

82
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,145
    workers begin by making     
     the chocolate cakes.       

83
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:58,417
 the first ingredient is water  
     followed by apple cider    
            vinegar.            

84
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,021
  then, they add either canola  
       or sunflower oil.        

85
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,558
       they mix the liquid      
           ingredients          
       in a large bowl.         

86
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,693
     then they add the dry      
         ingredients,           

87
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:13,098
 starting with tapioca starch,  
   bean flour, and sorghum,     

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,302
     a gluten-free grain.       

89
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:19,904
     next, they mix in cocoa    
             powder,            
    granulated cane sugar,      

90
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,041
    and light brown sugar.      

91
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:24,376
       they run the mixer       
     at a very high speed       

92
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,845
       to incorporate air       
        in the batter.          

93
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,315
     this will make the cake    
             lighter            
         and fluffier.          

94
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,184
    after about 4 minutes of    
            mixing,             

95
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,986
     the batter is ready.       

96
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:36,655
       they test a sample       
      using a viscometer,       

97
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,458
            a device            
 that measures the thickness.   

98
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,728
         if the batter          
   is the right consistency,    

99
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,831
 they pump it through a hopper  
 into a multi-head depositer.   

100
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,604
    each of its five nozzles    
   shoot one ounce of batter    

101
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,140
  onto a moving baking sheet.   

102
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:59,078
        a finished sheet        
contains seven rows of batter.  

103
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,214
  workers load multiple sheets  
    of batter into an oven.     

104
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,687
    the sheets rotate for 15    
             minutes            
   at 75 degree fahrenheit,     

105
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,622
   evenly baking the cakes.     

106
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,494
    the precise combination     
    of ingredients allows the   
             acids              

107
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,231
   in the apple cider vinegar   
     to react with the cocoa    
            powder.             

108
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,434
    the result is a perfect     
     little chocolate cake      

109
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,037
     that's rich in flavor      
     and moist in texture.      

110
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,109
      the main ingredient       
for the filling is shortening.  

111
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,712
           it's made            
  from sustainable palm oil.    

112
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:37,516
   this means the palm tress    
  were responsibly harvested.   

113
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,384
 they mix the shortening well,  

114
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,054
    incorporating enough air    
 to make it light and fluffy.   

115
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,723
         then they add          
      powdered cane sugar       

116
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,594
     and organic rice milk      
  as a dairy-free substitute.   

117
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:54,066
         the rice milk          
  makes the frosting creamy.    

118
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:58,136
   for vanilla frosting, they   
     simply add pure vanilla    
            extract.            

119
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,006
        this is a batch         
    of raspberry frosting,      

120
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,941
          so they add           
    pure raspberry extract      

121
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,211
         and beet juice         
          for color.            

122
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,879
 when they make mint frosting,  

123
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,014
  they use pure mint extract    

124
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,619
      and alfalfa extract       
       for green color.         

125
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,287
     lemon frosting is made     
    from pure lemon extract     

126
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,556
    and turmeric for color.     

127
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,826
      they check the shade      
     against a color chart      

128
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,961
 to ensure the correct flavor.  

129
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,902
 the multi-head depositer drops 
 frosting on the baking sheets  

130
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,439
   in the same configuration    
        as the batter.          

131
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,450
       then they assemble       
        the final pie.          

132
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:48,920
   workers start by placing a   
              piece             
      of cake on top of the     
           frosting.            

133
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,390
  they press down hard enough   
    to spread the frosting      

134
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,192
 just shy of the cake's edge.   

135
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,331
       they cover the top       
    with a sheet of parchment   
             paper              

136
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:03,135
  then place a baking sheet on  
               top              
       and flip it over.        

137
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:07,406
   they remove the top baking   
              sheet             
   and the parchment paper.     

138
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,411
 then, they carefully place the 
second cake onto the frosting.  

139
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,357
     workers roll the trays     
 of whoopie pies into a cooler  

140
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,627
    where the desserts chill    
     for about 15 minutes.      

141
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:32,297
    this hardens them so they   
              won't             
get squished during packaging.  

142
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:38,102
 workers place the whoopie pies 
      on a conveyer belt        

143
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,040
   that leads to an automated   
       wrapping machine.        

144
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,510
    it wraps double-printed     
   packaging around each pie    

145
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,147
  and seals them underneath.    

146
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,988
 then the machine cuts the film 
       between each pie.        

147
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,791
   the next machine packages    
   four sealed whoopie pies     

148
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,793
        per retail box.         

149
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,729
  there are zero preservatives  
    in these whoopie pies.      

150
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,132
     they're shipped frozen     
     to the grocery store       

151
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,200
     and sold in the freezer    
            section.            

152
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,669
  when it's time for a treat,   

153
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,039
      simply let them thaw      
to room temperature and enjoy.  

154
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,887
narrator: wooden utility poles  

155
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,490
    are a constant presence     
         in our lives.          

156
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,892
   they were originally built   
    in the mid-19th century     

157
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,562
  to suspend telegraph lines.   

158
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:39,564
    now, they hold up power     
        and phone lines         

159
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,967
     as well as fiber-optic     
      and coaxial cables        

160
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,303
         for television         
   and computer networking.     

161
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,243
  builders use many different   
  types of pine or fir trees    

162
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,712
    to make utility poles.      

163
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,717
   in the us, southern yellow   
              pine              
  is the most popular choice.   

164
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:03,021
   foresters select trees that  
               are              
  10 to 20 inches in diameter   

165
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,524
  and at least 30 feet high.    

166
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:08,594
   they look for a straight,    
 healthy trunk with few limbs.  

167
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,865
     the foresters mark the     
            selected            
    tress with spray paint.     

168
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,639
    then, the tree harvester    
  saws them down at the base.   

169
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,146
   after the loggers saw off    
  the limbs and cut the trees   

170
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,148
    to a specified length,      

171
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,351
          a log truck           
    delivers the poles to the   
             mill.              

172
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,557
      there, a truck scale      
       weighs the load.         

173
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,393
    then, workers ticket it     
    with a tracking number.     

174
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,099
   the truck enters the yard    

175
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:51,703
         and the poles          
   are unloaded into piles.     

176
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,740
    a loader feeds the poles    
    to a debarking machine.     

177
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,516
   the machine's razor-sharp    
   cutters shave of the bark    

178
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,886
     and the layer of tissue    
             beneath            
 the bark called the cambium.   

179
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,664
   next, a saw trims one inch   
   off the bottom of the log    

180
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,533
      to make it square.        

181
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,001
       at the same time,        
      nozzles spray lines       

182
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,272
      of red food coloring      
   at set intervals along the   
             pole.              

183
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,474
           these mark           
  indicate different lengths.   

184
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,348
         another worker         
     inspects the quality       

185
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,816
        and measures the        
         circumference.         

186
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,685
        this assessment         
 determines the wood's class.   

187
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,121
 he marks the length and class  
  on the bottom of the pole.    

188
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,761
     the bark and shavings      
    removed from the poles      

189
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,764
     don't go to waste --       

190
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,534
        a grinding mill         
 reduces them to small fibers.  

191
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:02,374
 the factory uses those fibers  
     to power the boiler.       

192
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,910
            the fire            
   in the boiler will product   
             heat,              

193
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,445
    which dries the poles.      

194
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,584
    after the poles have been   
             sorted             
     by length and class,       

195
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,720
            loaders             
  stack them on large trams.    

196
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,122
   they place spacer sticks     

197
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:21,392
 in between each pole to allow  
   air to flow around them.     

198
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,329
   then, the loaders push the   
              trams             
      into a large kiln.        

199
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,067
   the steam from the boiler    
   flows through the trams,     

200
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,205
 heating the inside of the kiln 
   to 200 degree fahrenheit.    

201
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,876
  large fans blow the hot air   
  around the poles for 3 days   

202
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,278
    until the wood is dry.      

203
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,150
         when the poles         
     come out of the kiln,      

204
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,586
       workers brand them       
   with product information.    

205
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,860
 next, they cut a flat surface  
   on one side of the pole.     

206
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,067
     then, they drill holes     
     to attach a crossarm.      

207
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,640
  after they drill the holes,   

208
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,576
      they stack the poles      
       in another tram.         

209
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,711
    this one takes them to      

210
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:15,180
        a 125-foot-long         
      treatment cylinder.       

211
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,054
       they lock the door       
    and vacuum all the air      

212
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,522
     out of the cylinder.       

213
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,259
     they fill the cylinder     
with a liquid that's 98% water  

214
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,396
 and 2% chemical preservative.  

215
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:35,199
 the preservative is a mixture  
of chrome, copper and arsenic.  

216
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,935
  once the cylinder is full,    

217
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,071
    the pumps start running     
   to pressurize the liquid,    

218
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,608
       infusing the wood        
  with the chemical solution.   

219
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,076
      the 2-hour process        

220
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:50,281
   leaves the wood resistant    
 to rot, fungus and termites.   

221
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,818
        next, inspectors        
   bore 3-inch holes into each  
              pole              

222
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,822
     to collect a sample.       

223
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,025
  the inspectors check to make  
     sure the preservative      

224
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:03,628
       saturated the wood       
     to the target depth.       

225
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,898
  then, they send the samples   
  to the on-site laboratory,    

226
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,834
     where they're dried in     
   a microwave oven and ground  
              up.               

227
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,504
    they also put the sample    
      in an x-ray machine       

228
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:16,575
 to analyze the chrome, copper  
      and arsenic levels.       

229
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:20,578
  these quality control steps   
ensure that every utility pole  

230
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,450
   contains the right amount    
  of chemical preservatives.    

231
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,488
    these finished poles will   
             assist             
 for at least 45 to 60 years.   

232
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,204
   narrator: humans have been   
    using roller conveyors      

233
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,207
    for thousands of years.     

234
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,142
     the ancient egyptians      
       used wood rollers        

235
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:55,347
    to move the large stones    
 needed to build the pyramids.  

236
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,949
       today's conveyors        
       are more complex.        

237
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,485
     but the basic concept      
      is still the same.        

238
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,493
   many factories use roller    
      conveyors to transfer     
           materials            

239
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:12,897
        from one station        
  to another during assembly.   

240
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:18,636
   they can move heavy loads    
  up to 65 feet in a minute.    

241
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,038
 to make the conveyer rollers,  

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,241
          this factory          
    starts with hollow steel    
             tubes.             

243
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,910
  they deliver to the factory   
          in batches.           

244
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:30,715
 after they arrive, a band saw  
   cuts the tubes to length.    

245
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,319
   the diameter can vary from   
              batch             
           to batch.            

246
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,589
         so an employee         
        obtains the exact       
         measurements.          

247
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,127
   he inputs the measurements   
        into a computer         

248
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,795
   that controls this laser.    

249
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:50,335
  the laser etches the company  
   logo onto a sheet of thick   
             steel              

250
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,471
   and cuts out support disks   
     for the roller axles.      

251
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,145
      the support disks fit     
            perfectly           
   into the hollow rollers.     

252
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,751
 an employee feeds a flat sheet 
           of steel             

253
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,688
to a computerized break press.  

254
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,823
       it bends the sheet       
     into a vertical rail       

255
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:16,695
    for the conveyer frame.     

256
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:19,297
        here's the steel        
   before and after bending.    

257
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,901
       a worker joins two       
        vertical rails          

258
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,905
      with steel supports       
     called crossmembers.       

259
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,241
he welds them where they meet.  

260
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,611
     this creates the frame     
   for the roller conveyer.     

261
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,451
  then, they paint the frame.   

262
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,987
      the paint isn't just      
        for decoration.         

263
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:47,124
it also protects against rust.  

264
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,393
       next, they install       
     the chain-driven axle      

265
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,863
  that will spin the roller.    

266
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,933
    an employee measures it     
 and confirms its dimensions.   

267
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,773
  another worker slides three   
 support disks on to the axle.  

268
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,580
 he welds the disks in place.   

269
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,918
      the disks on the end      
fit snugly to the roller rims.  

270
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,056
    this is why premeasuring    
       is so important.         

271
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,429
       he welds the disks       
   to the ends of the tubes.    

272
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,903
     he slides roller chain     
           sprockets            

273
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,406
    onto the end of the axle    
   and welds them in place.     

274
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,312
   he uses a dial indicator     

275
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,448
  to measure the circumference  
         of the roller          

276
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,684
          and confirm           
 that it's sufficiently round.  

277
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,521
  using a forklift, the team    

278
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,993
 lifts the motor and places it  
    in the conveyer frame.      

279
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,728
     they slide the motor's     
         threaded rods          

280
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,599
    into holes drilled in the   
             frame.             

281
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,269
    an employee places metal    
             washers            
     on the threaded rods.      

282
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:09,541
  then he screws nuts to them,  
    securing the motor to the   
             frame.             

283
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:13,545
     he installs a bearing      
on the end of the roller axle.  

284
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,715
   next, workers arrange the    
rollers on the conveyer frame.  

285
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,086
    they place the bearings     

286
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,289
         on the flange          
 of one of the vertical rails.  

287
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:33,431
    they attach the bearings    
     to the rail with socket    
            screws.             

288
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,234
       one of the workers       
    attaches the welded steel   
             chain              

289
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,236
    to the teeth of sprocket    
            wheels.             

290
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,445
     he joins the sections      
    of the roller chain with    
             links.             

291
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,152
     then he drops the ends     
    of the chains down to the   
             motor.             

292
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,326
  the worker loops the chains   
 around the motor sprockets...  

293
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,531
     and connects the ends      
     with the joiner plate      

294
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:10,735
      and retaining clip.       

295
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,104
       now, they're ready       
  to put this roller conveyer   

296
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,405
         to the test.           

297
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,744
    an employee measures the    
     rotational speed of the    
            rollers             

298
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,114
       with an instrument       
     called a tachometer.       

299
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,591
  he also tests the conveyor's  
ability to move heavy objects.  

300
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,162
        once approved,          

301
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,498
  the roller conveyer will be   
  shipped to another factory,   

302
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,166
        where it will be        
       an important part        

303
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,135
 of the manufacturing process.
