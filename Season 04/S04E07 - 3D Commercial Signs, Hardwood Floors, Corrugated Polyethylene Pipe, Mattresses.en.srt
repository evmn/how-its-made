00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:26,358
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,294
three-dimensional commercial sighs...      

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,566
...hardwood floors...     

6
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,706
...corrugated polyethylene pipe...      

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,544
...and mattresses.       

8
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,656
there's nothing like an eye-catching sign   

9
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,191
to attract customers.     

10
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,860
many signs have three-dimensional lettering  

11
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,128
or decoration.         

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,932
whether you hang a small plaque,
an old-fashioned shingle,   

13
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,667
or a huge overhead sign,    

14
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,503
a business name in 3-d really stands out.       

15
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,344
these signs are made      

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:22,214
of high-density polyurethane foam --      

17
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,884
a material that's waterproof and very durable.       

18
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,954
the sign starts out as a line drawing,       

19
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,223
which they render into three dimensions     

20
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,292
using specialized software.  

21
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,430
they send the file to a computer-controlled router

22
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,200
that carves the design into a piece of foam.      

23
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,839
the router can be outfitted with various blades      

24
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,176
to get different effects, such as rounded edges     

25
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,813
or this faceted effect known as prismatic lettering. 

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,587
once they've finished carving the design,      

27
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,323
they switch the router blade to an end mill --       

28
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,560
a cutting tool that slices straight down through the foam.

29
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,864
guided once again by the computer,        

30
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,401
the router gradually detaches the design's components.    

31
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,812
after coating the pieces with primer,          

32
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,415
they spray them with two to three coats    

33
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,816
of polyurethane paint.     

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,221
it dries to a durable, hard-as-plastic finish.    

35
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,824
this design calls for gold and black lettering. 

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,761
they'll use gold leaf instead of gold paint     

37
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:47,098
because it lasts longer and has finer color and luster.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,837
first, they brush on a special glue for gold leaf called size.

39
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,440
they wait 12 hours until it becomes tacky.    

40
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,044
wet glue would merely absorb the
gold, producing a dull finish. 

41
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,049
gold leaf crumbles at the slightest touch,    

42
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,686
so it comes on a paper backing,
making it easier to apply.   

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,390
gold leaf is available in different qualities.    

44
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,461
the lower the karat level, the more alloy it contains.  

45
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,597
this is 23-karat leaf --    

46
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,000
the closest you can get to pure gold.         

47
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,803
because it contains no other metals,        

48
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,472
it won't oxidize, tarnish, or dull            

49
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:31,343
despite acid rain, road salt, or other harsh elements.    

50
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,013
using silicone and screws,   

51
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,949
they mount the lettering onto a painted aluminum frame. 

52
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,219
another option would be to mount them         

53
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,954
on a painted background plaque 

54
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,323
made of the same foam as the letters.        

55
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,161
designs can also be engraved directly into a plaque     

56
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,765
and then highlighted      
using either paint or gold leaf.

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,803
they use vinyl film to mask the
parts that won't be decorated. 

58
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,642
this time they apply loose gold leaf        

59
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,945
because it's easier to brush into small areas.       

60
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,265
when the gold leafing is done, they carefully remove the film.

61
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,937
this factory makes signs    
out of a variety of materials --

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,675
everything from wood      
to stainless steel to plexiglas.

63
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,611
the material used is determined primarily    

64
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,881
by whether the sign will hang indoors or out.   

65
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,751
besides lettering, signs often incorporate    

66
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,954
3-d objects made of resin or fiberglass.         

67
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,357
the factory casts these components in molds,      

68
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,426
then paints and mounts them.  

69
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,297
they'll create this sign in  
various thicknesses of aluminum.

70
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,299
the same computer-guided router
does the cutting,       

71
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,903
but now they have to continually
douse its blade with coolant  

72
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,305
to prevent the friction-generated heat  

73
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,740
from melting the metal.    

74
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,413
they coat the components with metal primer       

75
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,916
before applying polyurethane paint.      

76
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,251
assembly is simple.      

77
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:23,121
they screw aluminum studs to the back of all the pieces, 

78
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,657
then bolt them onto the background plaque.     

79
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,930
thanks to the wonders of computer technology,    

80
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,933
design possibilities are virtually endless --    

81
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,036
a true sign of the times.   

82
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,949
narrator: there was a time when
exposing your hardwood floors 

83
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,220
meant you couldn't afford wall-to-wall carpeting.    

84
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,955
not anymore.          

85
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,424
hardwood floors are definitely in,       

86
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:03,428
and today there are so many wood and stain color choices, 

87
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,064
hardwood floors can suit any decor.      

88
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:18,843
the types of wood commonly used
for flooring include red oak...

89
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,579
beech...            

90
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,848
maple...            

91
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,251
white oak...          

92
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,786
walnut...           

93
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,856
birch...            

94
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,924
and ash.            

95
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,527
as soon as the wood arrives from the sawmill,       

96
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,796
workers at the floor factory stack it on racks,       

97
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,598
then pile the racks floor to ceiling        

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,702
in a dryer that's the size of a large barn.        

99
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:50,275
there, large fans circulate hot air around the racks.   

100
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:54,545
the wood's moisture content is between 40% and 60%,    

101
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,081
depending on the season.    

102
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,418
when that drops to about 7%, the wood is ready to come out. 

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,353
this drying process      

104
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,223
takes anywhere from 10 days to a month.          

105
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,624
the length of time varies   

106
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,728
because some types of wood dry much slower than others.  

107
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,832
the wood is in random lengths and widths,          

108
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:19,104
so the first step after drying is to cut it to standard sizes.

109
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,039
on the way to the ripsaw,   

110
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,243
the planks pass under an optical
device called an optimizer.  

111
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:29,648
in mere seconds, it reads the dimensions of each plank  

112
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,652
and sends that information to a computer.         

113
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,521
the computer calculates the greatest number      

114
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,791
of standard-size pieces that can be cut from the plank,

115
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,527
then guides the ripsaw to cut accordingly.      

116
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,264
this maximizes the yield and limits waste.       

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,334
flooring is made from medium-quality      

118
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:53,471
rather than top-quality lumber to keep prices competitive.  

119
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,007
as the pieces exit the saw,  

120
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,077
workers manually cut out any large knots or other defects --

121
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,881
weak points at which a piece could potentially snap     

122
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,616
and jam up the equipment.   

123
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,692
the pieces now travel to a machine called the molder.

124
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,028
its revolving steel knives spin at a rate         

125
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,232
of 6,000 rotations per minute, 

126
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,101
carving a tongue down one side of each piece         

127
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,804
and a groove down the other.  

128
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,382
workers do frequent spot checks

129
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,019
to make sure the tongues    
and grooves fit together snugly.

130
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,456
the next machine carves grooves

131
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,726
on what will be the underside of the pieces.         

132
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,830
this is for air circulation and stability.         

133
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,876
using crosscut saws,      

134
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,345
workers remove any faults in the wood          

135
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:11,349
and divide pieces that have noticeable color variations.  

136
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:15,553
this is the first step towards sorting the wood by grade.   

137
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,956
now a machine called an end matcher         

138
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,625
carves a tongue and groove on the two ends.        

139
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,032
here's the view from inside the machine.    

140
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,912
workers check again for faults,

141
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,451
then, assessing quality and  
color, sort each piece by grade.

142
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,725
this will be prefinished flooring,           

143
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,394
so the pieces now run through a sander    

144
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,597
to prepare them to receive eight coats of varnish.    

145
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,201
for certain finishes, the first
coat contains wood stain.   

146
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,739
all subsequent coats are colorless.         

147
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,541
between each application,   

148
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,012
ultraviolet lamps dry the varnish in just seconds.  

149
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,948
as the flooring exits the last drying oven,     

150
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,683
it's ready for packaging.   

151
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,420
unfinished hardwood flooring  

152
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,891
has to be sanded, stained, and varnished after it's installed.

153
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,727
prefinished flooring eliminates that extra work,  

154
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,932
sparing you the dust, the drying time, and the smell.

155
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,711
narrator: drainage pipes are vital to many industries. 

156
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,380
the pipes are generally made out of plastic,        

157
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,516
and they're an important component     

158
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,051
of municipal infrastructure.  

159
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,319
cities use them        

160
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,121
to prevent streets from flooding
in heavy rain.         

161
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,724
forestry companies use them as culverts          

162
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,427
when building logging roads over streams.         

163
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,199
this corrugated pipe is made from a type of plastic     

164
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:13,671
called high-density polyethylene, or h.d.p.e.   

165
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,276
the pipe factory combines three 
varieties of h.d.p.e. pellets --

166
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,011
plain pellets, recycled pellets,

167
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,948
and pellets with a colorant that provides u.v. protection. 

168
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,753
the proportions vary depending on the pipe's intended use.  

169
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,156
the mixer transfers the pellets

170
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,891
to a machine called the extruder.      

171
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,829
it first heats them      
to about 450 degrees fahrenheit.

172
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,366
this melts them into a thick liquid.      

173
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,301
then it assembles what's called the corrugator --

174
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,772
a mold whose cavity is the shape of a corrugated pipe.

175
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,056
the extruder injects the liquefied h.d.p.e.     

176
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,460
into the corrugator, applying vacuum pressure    

177
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,530
to spread it evenly into all the crevices.     

178
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,867
a built-in cooling system hardens the plastic      

179
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,002
just enough to set the shape, 

180
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,539
enabling them to extract the pipe from the mold.     

181
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,545
the pipe then passes through a cold-water shower,      

182
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,948
which hardens the plastic completely.          

183
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,887
the pipe now enters      
a machine called the perforator,

184
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,689
which punches holes around the circumference.   

185
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,228
these holes, whose size varies by model, serve two purposes.  

186
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,630
first, they make the pipe lighter        

187
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,632
and therefore easier to transport and install.   

188
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,837
second, they enable water to enter the pipe constantly  

189
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,108
at virtually any location, then
flow to the end and drain out. 

190
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,181
it's crucial to prevent soil from clogging these holes,   

191
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,116
so this next machine wraps the pipe         

192
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,886
in a filter cloth made of polyester.       

193
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,457
they don't want this filter cloth to unravel,       

194
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,193
so the machine heat-seals it closed.     

195
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,264
this corrugated polyethylene pipe is finished 

196
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,700
and ready to be packaged and shipped.          

197
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,605
the packaging line is highly automated.      

198
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,407
robotic equipment first coils the length of pipe       

199
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,910
that the customer ordered.   

200
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,252
then it cuts the end.     

201
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,036
the robots tie the coil at several points       

202
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,771
so that it doesn't unravel.  

203
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,869
workers now transfer the coiled pipe        

204
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,338
to a machine that covers it in plastic stretch wrap.    

205
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,341
this covering will protect the filter cloth        

206
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,678
from the damaging effects of dirt, moisture, and light. 

207
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,618
this factory also produces what's called double-wall pipe,

208
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,690
which has a corrugated outside wall and a smooth inside wall. 

209
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,294
this type of pipe drains more efficiently    

210
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,897
because water flows faster over a flat surface      

211
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,300
than over the repeated peaks  
and valleys of a corrugated one.

212
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,837
making this type of pipe requires two extruders --   

213
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,307
one to form each wall.     

214
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,709
samples from every production run         

215
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,511
go through several quality-control tests.     

216
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,516
this compression strength test ensures the pipe won't buckle  

217
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,386
under the weight of the earth above it.     

218
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,321
high-density polyethylene pipe 

219
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,390
may be lightweight compared to cement pipe,    

220
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,126
but it's equally resistant   

221
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,396
to pressure, chemicals, and abrasion.         

222
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,738
narrator: mattress anatomy 101.     

223
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,872
the comfort layer       

224
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,342
is the quilted fabric top and the underlying foam.    

225
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,613
the support layer is made up of the interior coils     

226
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,348
and heavy-gauge wire along the perimeter.      

227
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,885
the foundation, or box spring, is a separate bottom unit   

228
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,488
that acts like a giant shock absorber.    

229
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,965
for thousands of years, people slept on the floor   

230
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,902
on palettes stuffed with natural material 

231
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,271
such as straw, wool, or feathers.          

232
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,707
during the middle ages,    

233
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,310
family members would set down their palettes         

234
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,512
around the home's central fireplace.       

235
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,915
only royalty and the wealthy had separate sleeping quarters 

236
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,251
and mattresses that sat off the floor     

237
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,454
on a wooden frame called a bedstead.       

238
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,125
beds didn't become common in middle-class homes     

239
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,960
until the 1600s.        

240
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:48,739
the comfort layer, or quilt, starts with ticking --     

241
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,743
a cover fabric made of polyester
or cotton polyester.      

242
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,946
under that are layers of polyester cloth, foam,   

243
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,281
and fiber.           

244
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:01,352
luxury mattresses contain wool,
silk, or cashmere fiber.    

245
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,622
the assembled layers go into an automated sewing machine.  

246
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,090
it's computer programmed    

247
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,093
to stitch one of several quilted designs.        

248
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,761
a roller compresses the thick pile         

249
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,897
to enable the 3-inch-long needles    

250
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,700
to pierce through all the layers.        

251
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,772
the two polyester sheets inside the quilt are essential.

252
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,708
one is directly under the ticking.          

253
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,244
it acts as a barrier to prevent scratchy fibers   

254
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,047
from poking through the top of the mattress.        

255
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,850
the other is at the bottom of the quilt.         

256
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,852
it holds the stitches in place,

257
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,922
preventing the thread from moving around inside   

258
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,390
and ripping the foam.     

259
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,727
a cutting wheel now trims the quilt      

260
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,529
to twin, double, queen, or king size,         

261
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,199
leaving an extra 2 inches all around.          

262
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,535
this surplus ensures the foam will reach       

263
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,005
all the way to the edge once the quilt's sewn up.   

264
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,675
the sewing table is air-cushioned,       

265
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,677
like an air hockey table.   

266
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,011
this floats the quilt,     

267
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,814
enabling the seamstress to maneuver it easily.     

268
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,883
as she stitches the quilt closed,            

269
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,885
she trims off the excess    

270
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,490
and sews a polyester band to the
underside along the perimeter. 

271
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,826
meanwhile,           

272
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,695
an automated sewing machine produces the mattress sides  

273
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,065
from the same ticking used for the quilt.      

274
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:26,037
it stitches the fabric to a foam
sheet 4/10 of an inch thick,  

275
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,772
making a quilted design.    

276
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,242
low-end mattresses have unquilted side fabric.  

277
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,114
elsewhere in the factory, as we see here in slow motion, 

278
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,251
automated machines produce the guts of the mattress --  

279
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,652
the coils.           

280
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,388
low-end mattresses contain continuous coils --      

281
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,127
rows of springs formed out   
of one long strip of steel wire.

282
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,729
better mattresses contain individual coils,   

283
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,800
each formed from a separate piece of wire.         

284
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,869
this machine is producing open coils --         

285
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,807
a type of individual coil used in mid-quality mattresses.

286
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,545
open coils have an hourglass shape and are made of steel.  

287
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,952
luxury mattresses contain pocket coils --    

288
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,887
individual coils that are barrel-shaped     

289
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,892
and made of steel, manganese, and carbon --    

290
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,561
a high-strength combination of metals.           

291
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,430
the coils are individually wrapped in cloth pockets    

292
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,433
to prevent them from tangling together.    

293
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,635
this machine is producing open coils.    

294
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,305
it first heats the wire with an electric current    

295
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,507
to make the metal flexible.  

296
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,175
once it forms the coil,    

297
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,779
it curls the two ends of the wire like a pig's tail. 

298
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,915
this pigtail finishing prevents the sharp ends    

299
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,785
from poking through the mattress surface. 

300
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,924
they line up the open coils in rows,            

301
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,994
then feed them into a machine that connects them       

302
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,730
by running long strips of pigtailed wire       

303
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,766
along the tops and bottoms.  

304
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,670
using pigtailed wire again,  

305
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,738
workers attach thick, steel edge wire        

306
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,074
along the top and bottom perimeters     

307
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,944
and steel brackets called edge guards       

308
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,546
at strategic points along the sides.        

309
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,149
these supports are what keep the mattress firm

310
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,251
when you sit on the edge.   

311
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:27,558
pocket coils are glued to each other at the center.  

312
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,161
this enables them to move independently         

313
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,229
so that motion on one side of the bed     

314
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,965
won't affect the other side.  

315
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:39,036
a reinforcement netting holds the coils in position.  

316
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,506
workers attach the edge wires and edge guards        

317
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,308
to the outer coils with thick staples.      

318
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,178
the rest of the assembly process

319
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,647
is the same for all types of mattresses.      

320
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,849
after adding two layers of foam,

321
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,851
workers attach a quilt to the top and bottom      

322
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,522
by stapling the polyester band on the quilt's underside    

323
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,124
to the metal components.    

324
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,793
the final step is to attach the sides.    

325
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,696
a special machine called a mattress closer    

326
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,331
joins them to the quilts    

327
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,235
with a reinforcement strip made of durable fabric.    

328
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,943
