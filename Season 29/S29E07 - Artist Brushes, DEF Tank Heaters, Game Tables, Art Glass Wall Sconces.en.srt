captions paid for by discovery communications    

3
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,954
narrator: an artist's paint brush can have synthetic bristles  

4
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,690
or natural ones made of animal hair.      

5
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,725
which type to use is really a matter       

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,528
of the artist's preference.  

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,697
however, painters often tend to use   

8
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,132
a natural brush for watercolors,

9
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,970
a synthetic brush for acrylics,
and either type for oils.   

10
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,441
these natural-hair paintbrushes
are made of red sable,     

11
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,978
which is tail hair from a species of weasel.   

12
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,448
red sable is renowned for its softness        

13
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,185
and for spreading paint thinly and evenly.       

14
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,354
an experienced head-maker performs the initial steps   

15
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,491
of making the head of the paintbrush.       

16
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,994
she unrolls and straightens out
a bundle of red sable,     

17
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:39,998
then separates enough hairs for one brush of this size.  

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,301
she inserts the hairs into a metal band,       

19
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:45,037
called a ferrule, made of nickel-plated brass.  

20
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,873
she feels how they fit in the ferrule.        

21
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,743
if the fit's too tight, she removes some hairs.    

22
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,345
if it's too loose, she adds some.         

23
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,082
brushes of different shapes require different tensions.  

24
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,620
the head-maker takes the correct brass mold     

25
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,290
for the brush shape she's making
and inserts the hairs     

26
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,927
all the way down into the mold cavity.   

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,804
she ties the roots of the hairs together     

28
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,006
with a string...        

29
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:25,311
then removes them from the mold.         

30
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,684
she inserts the brush head back into the ferrule...    

31
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,522
...then removes the string.  

32
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,465
next, using a template, she adjusts what's called   

33
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,299
the length-out of the brush head.       

34
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,769
length-out is how far the hairs protrude       

35
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,205
from the end of the ferrule.  

36
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,375
after removing stray hairs,  

37
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,877
she aligns the end of the ferrule         

38
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,613
with the edge of the nearly 1-inch-long template      

39
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,915
and pulls out or pushes in the hairs     

40
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,818
until their tips align with the opposite edge     

41
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,120
of the template.        

42
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,326
she completes her specialized work by suspending 

43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,363
the assembled brush head from a rack.          

44
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,368
another worker now fills a syringe with epoxy glue,   

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,837
then, with the syringe, fills the ferrule       

46
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,775
with enough glue to submerge the hairs.     

47
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:32,111
once the glue has dried overnight,      

48
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,712
another worker taps the brush head      

49
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,447
against a strip of adhesive tape

50
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:39,284
to remove any short hairs that didn't adhere.      

51
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:45,791
she dips the hairs into a solution of starch and water 

52
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,026
and works the solution into all the hairs       

53
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,894
by massaging the head on a towel.          

54
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,063
the starch allows the hairs  

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,867
to be trained to a permanent shape.     

56
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,901
she makes this particular pointed shape         

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,103
by spinning the head,     

58
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,774
then smoothing the hairs with her fingers.       

59
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:08,713
the starch dries overnight, locking in the shape.     

60
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,949
to make the paintbrush handle, 

61
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,752
a worker inserts birch dowels in a pegboard,  

62
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,754
then mounts the board upside-down          

63
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,456
on a dipping machine.     

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,591
this machine submerges the dowels      

65
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,960
in black lacquer paint.    

66
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,466
after one day of drying time, there is a second dip,     

67
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,036
partway this time, in silver paint.        

68
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,039
the machine has markings to indicate          

69
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,608
how deep to dip the dowels for each color.        

70
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,951
after another day of drying time,        

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,153
there is a third dip,     

72
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,389
this time partway in black paint.    

73
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:54,193
this creates a black handle with a silver stripe.     

74
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,896
once the last coat of black paint dries,     

75
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,498
a worker uses a pad printer to stamp lettering       

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,803
on the handle with quick-dry silver ink.   

77
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,105
one stamp simultaneously applies

78
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,108
the manufacturer's name, the brush-hair material,    

79
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,078
the size of the brush, and the series number.     

80
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,950
a worker glues the brush head onto the handle.        

81
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,953
then the worker sets the brush aside      

82
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,487
for a couple of hours     

83
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,290
until the glue partially dries to a tacky state        

84
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,493
because the next step, crimping,

85
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,295
would crack the fully dried, hardened glue.         

86
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,135
the worker inserts the ferrule into a crimping machine,    

87
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,902
which has been loaded with the dye          

88
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,372
that's the correct diameter for this brush handle.     

89
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,909
the machine crimps the ferrule tightly to the handle,     

90
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,711
attaching it permanently.   

91
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:51,482
once that glue hardens,    
the paintbrush is finally ready.

92
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:56,455
from this point onward, it's in the artist's hands.  

93
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,901
♪♪         

94
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:14,439
narrator: a diesel exhaust fluid, or d.e.f., tank heater, 

95
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,141
is a device which prevents diesel exhaust fluid      

96
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,343
from freezing.         

97
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,812
diesel exhaust fluid is a solution sprayed     

98
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,748
into the exhaust system of a vehicle          

99
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,749
with a diesel engine      

100
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,018
to break down dangerous polluting chemicals      

101
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,287
the tailpipe would otherwise emit.     

102
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,925
once the outdoor temperature dips  

103
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,561
to the diesel exhaust fluid's freezing point,        

104
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,597
the vehicle's computer automatically starts up    

105
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,834
this heater installed inside the d.e.f. holding tank.    

106
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,770
the heater warms the tank   

107
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:50,141
by cycling hot radiator fluid though its tubing.       

108
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,311
at the factory, workers form the heater tube out of lengths 

109
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,415
of stainless-steel tube.    

110
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,952
a computer-guided saw cuts a tube to the length required 

111
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:02,754
for the heater size they're producing.       

112
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,457
cars have smaller d.e.f. heaters.        

113
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:09,928
trucks and construction equipment have larger ones.  

114
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,400
a worker programs a robotic bender        

115
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,237
to bend the cut tube to the required shape.     

116
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,318
these bends are so complex   

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,120
that no traditional manually operated bending machine    

118
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,624
would be able to do them this accurately.        

119
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,465
the heater sits right inside the d.e.f. holding tank.    

120
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,134
that's why manufacturers use stainless steel      

121
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,836
rather than ordinary steel for this tubing.        

122
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,105
stainless steel better resists 

123
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,742
the corrosiveness of the d.e.f. fluid.      

124
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,315
at the next station, a worker inserts        

125
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,385
the bent tube into the tank heater sensor unit.  

126
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:12,424
the tube fits through openings in the sensor unit's header.  

127
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:15,827
when connected by a cable to the vehicle's computer,   

128
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,896
the sensor unit detects the level,       

129
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,699
temperature, and quality of the d.e.f.   

130
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,938
next, the worker puts the tubing
in a punch press,       

131
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,774
which shapes the ends.     

132
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,947
he puts those shaped ends in a bender,          

133
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,783
which curves them.       

134
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,822
another tube made the same way siphons d.e.f.         

135
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,724
from the holding tank to a device          

136
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,927
that sprays the fluid on the exhaust stream.     

137
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,496
he installs a rubber o-ring  

138
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:55,334
onto this siphon tube and applies lubricant.     

139
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,236
he installs the tube into the header,        

140
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,739
and the o-ring fits into a notch.         

141
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,542
the worker then installs a bracket    

142
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,512
at the base of the heater, riveting it to the tubing.   

143
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,219
the bracket holds a rubber grommet        

144
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:19,124
that secures the heater in place
inside the d.e.f. tank.    

145
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,694
further up, he rivets on a second bracket to stabilize 

146
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,965
the sensor tube that runs down the center of the sensor unit. 

147
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,635
this prevents the tube from rattling.         

148
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,338
then he installs the return tube,        

149
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,041
which feeds any excess unsprayed d.e.f.        

150

back to the holding tank.

he flips the heater over to attach the drain tube,   

155
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,460
which is the bottom half of the return tube.      

156
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,168
he caps all the tubes to keep them clean       

157
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,972
until the heater is installed in the vehicle.  

158
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,880
he attaches a nylon filter to the siphon tube,      

159
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,683
securing it in place with the retaining clip.    

160
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,187
as the siphon tube draws the d.e.f.        

161
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,422
from the holding tank toward the sprayer,      

162
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,993
the filter removes contaminants
such as sand.         

163
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,729
finally, this rubber grommet  

164
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,733
snaps into the bracket at the base of the heater.   

165
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,902
the grommet fits over     
a raised bump on the tank floor,

166
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:41,072
holding the unit securely in place.       

167
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,675
once connected to the vehicle's computer,    

168
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,011
the heater keeps the diesel exhaust fluid

most wealthy people in europe and america     

173

helped by a laser scanner   

183
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,869
so the saw can make clean and judicious cuts.   

184

another scanner detects the orange marks,       

188

the next worker dips one side of the strips         

191
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,959
in polyvinyl acetate, a super strong glue.      

192
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:12,163
the next worker arranges the strips in a specific order,

00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,798
alternating the grain to balance

194

the wood's expansion and contraction forces.    

195
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:23,008
he clamps them tightly together
and allows the glue to set.  

196
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,343
workers sand the top and bottom

197
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:30,514
and trim the sides to produce one of the rim segments.    

198
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,485
a computerized router now moves
from one segment to the next

it then drills holes in the sides for the wooden dowels

201
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,363
that will be used to join the eight table segments.

he arranges the segments in a circular pattern     

208
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,454
and inserts the dowels in the corresponding holes.  

209
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,393
he pulls the eight rim segments
tightly together

00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,228
with a strap clamp       

211
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,632
and leaves the glued      
configuration to cure overnight.

212
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,369
this permanently bonds the table rim segments.    

213
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,504
the next day,         

214
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,774
a computerized router rounds the outside of the rim. 

215
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,946
it also trims the inside of the rim     

216
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,114
and forms a channel for the insertion       

217
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,184
of the center of the game table.

with the rim now game side down,
the next member of the team  

220
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:57,334
pipes more of the super adhesive
into the inner channel.    

221
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,038
he inserts the dining-table surface.   

222
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,641
this maple center has been precision-cut     

223
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:05,010
to fit into the groove in the rim.          

224
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,382
using a rubber mallet, he taps the tabletop      

225
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:13,084
to entrench it more firmly in the groove.   

226
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,324
he flips the tabletop back to the game side     

227
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,126
and installs 16 screws on an angle          

228
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:25,162
to tighten the top to the rim. 

229
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,532
the screws serve as a clamp system

00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,909
with the center now bonded to the rim,

00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,878
a worker sprays a base color  

233
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,780
and then a wood stain onto both sides.        

234
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,517
this highlights the character of the wood   

235
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,486
and gives it a warm tone.   

236
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,192
a worker then applies two coats
of a urethane varnish     

237
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,861
and sands the finish between the coats.       

238
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:03,567
then, workers assemble a pedestal base...       

239
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,772
and install a piece of laminate
in a stained maple frame.   

240
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,641
this creates a storage compartment     

241
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,176
under the tabletop,      

242
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,977
as well as providing a foundation          

243
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,246
for the tabletop to sit on.  

244
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,584
the team transfers the pedestal base       

245
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,822
to the table foundation.    

246
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,389
they bolt them together,    

247
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,326
which creates the support structure for the tabletop.  

248
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,565
back to the game tabletop,   

249
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:38,236
a worker installs a cloth-covered padded insert. 

250
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,905
this will serve as a smooth  

251

and cushy surface for card playing.       

252
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,879
and with that,         

253
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,116
workers finally transfer the game tabletop to the base.

at this factory, workers craft every sconce by hand.

00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,340
the process starts with scrap glass        

268
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,909
from a window manufacturer.  

269
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:54,479
the craftsperson measures the glass       

270
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,981
and scores it with a cutting wheel.

using special pliers,     

272
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:02,987
she applies pressure to fracture
the glass along the score line.

273
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:07,057
she manually completes the break.           

274
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,160
she cuts a large pane and a smaller one.       

275
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,597
she sets the large one aside      

276
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,035
and tapes the small one over a detailed sketch of artwork. 

277
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,936
she traces the lines of the sketch    

278
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:22,874
onto the clear glass using liquefied dark enamel,  

279
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,141
creating thick lines      

280
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,680
to mimic the look of lead veins
in stained glass.       

281

once the lines dry and harden a bit,       

282
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,819
she paints the designated colors
within them.          

283
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,588
each area of the sketch has a letter that corresponds 

284
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,824
to a particular color of enamel.           

285
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:45,964
she centers the painted pane on the clear larger one    

286
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,933
to feature the artwork more prominently.       

287
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:53,705
then she transfers the two panes
to an electrically-fired kiln. 

288
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:58,476
it will gradually heat the glass
to over 1,400 degrees fahrenheit

289
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,979
and then cool it over a period of 10 hours.   

290
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,514
this prevents fracturing    

291
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,184
as the heat fuses the two panes together  

292
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,053
and bakes the artwork into the glass.        

293
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:13,524
the baking also deepens the enamel colors.       

294
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:18,696
next, a mixer blends clay to a pudding-like consistency. 

295
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,766
an employee pours the clay into plaster molds       

296
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,568
for the sconce's casing.    

297
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,637
the clay begins to firm up   

298
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,972
along the inside walls of the mold.          

299
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:32,110
he pours out the clay that's still liquefied.    

300
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:37,948
now a putty-like consistency, he trims the excess at the top.

301
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,152
he sets the mold on its side and opens it to reveal     

302
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,855
the newly shaped sconce casing.

303
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,524
it cures overnight.      

304
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,960
the next day, the part is still soft     

305
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,661
but can withstand sanding.   

306
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:54,933
the worker thins the rim and smooths the outside.    

307
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,501
with a sharp knife,      

308
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,971
he cuts an opening for the art glass pane,    

309
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,108
first scoring the still-fragile clay     

310
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,344
and then making deeper cuts.  

311
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,148
he removes the clay cutout.  

312
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,350
using a different knife, he now sculpts         

313
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,418
a chiseled profile along the edges        

314
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,155
that will eventually frame the art glass pane.      

315
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,194
he cuts a hole for the light socket      

316
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,829
and another one to mount the fixture      

317
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,031
to an electrical junction box. 

318
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:31,536
the clay casing now spends eight hours in a kiln,     

319
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:35,839
exposed to a temperature of over 1,800 degrees fahrenheit. 

320
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:41,579
this transforms the clay into a durable glass-like ceramic. 

321
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,816
he brushes a colored glaze on the outside of the ceramic, 

322
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:48,986
leaving the inside white to reflect the light forward. 

323
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,423
he bakes the ceramic in another kiln for six hours, 

324
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,892
and this fuses the glaze to it.

325
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,329
the final finish is glossy,  

326
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,132
and the color is intrinsic to the ceramic.        

327
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,303
the worker now installs the light socket 

328
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,806
in one of the holes in the sconce casing      

329
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,576
and pulls the wiring through the back.       

330
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,683
he slides a brass washer over the wires at the back,  

331
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,184
followed by a second washer  

332
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,420
that's connected to a ground wire.       

333
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,756
he secures the washers     

334
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,559
and the wires to the back of the sconce with a nut.   

335
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,800
he screws a bulb into the socket.        

336
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,236
it's now ready for the art glass pane.    

337
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,976
he pipes adhesive onto the sides of the pane.  

338
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,878
picking it up from the unglued ends,     

339
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,580
he moves the pane into place  

340
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,083
in the ceramic frame of the sconce window.     

341
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:59,057
he clips the pane to the ceramics around     

342
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,591
using clothespins       

343
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,562
and leaves the sconce overnight
for the adhesive to cure.   

344
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,198
the next day,         

345
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,501
the art glass sconce is ready to shine,       

346
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,405
and after installation, the lighting is on the wall.
