00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:07,907
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,452
            narrator:           
    despite the name "lead,"    

4
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,988
      the core of a pencil      
  isn't actually made of lead.  

5
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,124
it's made primarily of graphite,

6
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:01,794
  a form of carbon that's very  
 abundant in the earth's crust. 

7
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,396
    to produce pencil leads,    

8
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,465
  they combine graphite powder  
      with water and clay.      

9
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:10,169
  the higher the ratio of clay, 
      the harder the lead.      

10
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,277
  quality graphite pencil leads 
       don't break easily       

11
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,947
 and glide smoothly on the page.

12
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:32,825
   graphite is mined from both  
 open-pit mines and shaft mines,

13
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,794
    like this one in germany.   

14
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:44,437
    miners use hammer drills    
  to bore holes for explosives. 

15
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,445
 the chunks of ore must contain 
      at least 30% graphite     

16
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,916
        to make the area        
 financially viable for mining. 

17
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:05,124
at the surface, a crusher breaks
   the ore into small pieces.   

18
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,992
   then, adding water and oil,  

19
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,194
        they pulverize it       
       in a rotating mill.      

20
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,531
          this ore soup         
    then flows into a system    

21
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,067
   that separates the graphite  
      from the impurities.      

22
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,936
     the graphite particles     
    cling to the air bubbles    

23
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,805
    and float to the surface.   

24
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,808
          skimmers send         
   this layer of graphite foam  

25
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,677
       back into the mill.      

26
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:30,216
  5 cycles later, the graphite  
      concentration is 96%.     

27
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:36,489
   however, it's soaking wet,   
  so it has to go into a dryer. 

28
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:42,160
      after spinning around     
    at 572 degrees fahrenheit   

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,763
      for about 30 seconds,     

30
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,700
      the graphite becomes      
 a completely dry, fine powder. 

31
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,303
      mined and processed,      

32
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,273
    it's ready to be shipped    
     to the pencil factory.     

33
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,048
      to make pencil leads,     

34
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,786
  the factory combines graphite 
   powder with clay and water.  

35
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,122
      during the 35-minute      
          mixing cycle,         

36
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,725
    it's critical to control    
       the blending speed,      

37
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:16,595
     pressure, temperature,     
       and moisture level.      

38
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,532
          this produces         
     homogenous granules --     

39
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,333
       the key to ensuring      
       that all the leads       

40
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,536
   will be uniform in quality.  

41
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,941
      the granules go into      
       a hydraulic press,       

42
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,012
        which shapes them       
    into a cylindrical block.   

43
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,420
   workers then wrap the block  
  in film to prevent drying out 

44
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,256
   and set it aside for a week  
            to cure.            

45
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:57,102
   they load each cured block   
     into a hydraulic press,    

46
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,104
     which pushes it through    
         a forming die,         

47
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,974
       producing one long,      
        continuous lead.        

48
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:12,184
         different dies         
   give different-sized leads.  

49
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,720
   the next machine then cuts   
       the continuous lead      

50
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,022
      into pencil lengths.      

51
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,661
          the leads are         
 the right thickness and length,

52
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,330
  but they're soft and pliable  

53
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:28,334
because they still contain water
    from the mixing process.    

54
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,071
     workers load the leads     
       into a rotary dryer      

55
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,841
   at 320 degrees fahrenheit.   

56
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,546
    12 hours later, the leads   
    exit the dryer straight,    

57
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,615
  but not quite strong enough,  

58
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,418
   so next they go into a kiln  
          for 10 hours          

59
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,553
          at more than          
    1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

60
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:52,958
 this firing transforms the clay
 that's mixed with the graphite,

61
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,228
    strengthening the leads     
    to their final hardness.    

62
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:04,770
   finally, a 12-hour bath in   
a mixture of high-quality waxes.

63
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,272
    the waxes fill the pores    
          in the leads,         

64
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:11,577
leaving them with a surface that
  glides smoothly across paper. 

65
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,712
           throughout           
     the production process,    

66
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,916
    the factory puts samples    
 through quality-control testing

67
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,318
       to check hardness,       
   break resistance, diameter,  

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,055
and, of course, writing quality.

69
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,260
      this company produces     
    three different qualities   

70
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:32,798
        of graphite leads       
in 16 different hardness levels,

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,201
        plus a full array       
of colored leads made similarly,

72
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,405
    but with pigment powders    
 and waxes rather than graphite.

73
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,157
 narrator: when the clarinetist 
   blows into the instrument,   

74
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,894
    a reed in the mouthpiece    
    vibrates, creating sound.   

75
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,629
    to turn that basic sound    
      into different notes,     

76
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,099
     the player manipulates     
  the length of the air column  

77
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,367
      inside the instrument     

78
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,437
     by opening and closing     
     different tone holes.      

79
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:25,317
      the standard clarinet     
       has 24 tone holes.       

80
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,920
       the musician covers      
     some with his fingers,     

81
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:31,456
   the rest by pressing keys.   

82
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:36,862
  those keys are made of nickel 
  silver or, sometimes, brass.  

83
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,467
   they inject hot wax into a   
 plaster mold of a specific key.

84
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,872
      then, using hot wax,      

85
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,143
   they attach several models   
  of the same key onto a stem.  

86
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,552
       they put this tree,      
as it's called, into a cylinder,

87
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,622
then into a mold-making machine,

88
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,958
      which fills the space     
         around the tree        

89
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,561
       with a silica-based      
        ceramic material.       

90
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,430
    when the ceramic hardens,   

91
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,299
  they melt out the wax through 
   an exit hole at the bottom,  

92
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,936
         leaving behind         
      a tree-shaped cavity.     

93
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,040
   now they transfer the mold   
      to a casting machine      

94
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,910
     and load nickel silver     
    into a miniature furnace.   

95
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,147
         the metal melts        
  and fills the entire cavity.  

96
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,119
      to cool and solidify      
          the casting,          

97
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,922
     they submerge the mold     
       in lukewarm water.       

98
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,858
       the metal contracts      
    as its temperature drops,   

99
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
    loosening from the mold.    

100
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:47,466
      they extract the tree     
      and remove the keys.      

101
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,306
 then they grind off the little 
     stub left on each key.     

102
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:04,149
 next the keys go into a tumbler
  filled with synthetic stones. 

103
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,151
   the stones polish the keys,  

104
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,654
     preparing their surface    
       for silver plating.      

105
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,091
 silver doesn't adhere directly 
        to nickel silver,       

106
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,161
     so they plate the keys     
        in copper first.        

107
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:21,233
  for each layer, they submerge 
the keys in a chemical solution,

108
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,769
           then apply           
   a negative electric charge   

109
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:27,506
 while running a positive charge
 to pieces of the plating metal.

110
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:31,309
    like a magnet, this draws   
 particles of the plating metal 

111
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:36,515
         onto the keys,         
  forming a thin overall coat.  

112
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,384
   a clarinet's two-part body   
   is typically made of wood    

113
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,387
 or, like these, plastic resin. 

114
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,191
     a computer-guided drill    
       bores 24 tone holes      

115
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,727
      and 40 smaller holes      
         for the posts,         

116
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,996
          which support         
       the key mechanisms.      

117
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,864
     a sonic welding machine    

118
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,201
        presses each post       
    into its respective hole    

119
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,937
      while zapping it with     
   a high-frequency sound wave  

120
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,473
       to melt the plastic      
        around the base.        

121
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,410
 this anchors the post securely.

122
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,213
  the next machine reams a hole 
  through the head of each post 

123
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,582
          for the rods          
     that operate the keys.     

124
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,488
  they wrap natural cork around 
the connecting ends of the body,

125
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,959
then illuminate the interior for
  a quality-control inspection. 

126
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,898
          it's time for         
       the final assembly.      

127
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,500
         they lubricate         
      all the moving parts,     

128
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,237
    then install the 17 keys    
     onto their mechanisms.     

129
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,520
     each key has a foam pad    
         to prevent air         

130
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,523
        from leaking out        
    when the hole's covered.    

131
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,659
    they use a strip of foil    

132
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:56,862
    to test whether the seal    
        is tight enough.        

133
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,365
     with both body sections    
   of the instrument finished,  

134
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,134
    a musician assembles them   

135
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:05,204
      and checks that each      
  and every key moves fluidly.  

136
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:08,406
 then, after attaching the bell 
       and the mouthpiece,      

137
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,410
          she conducts          
      a sound-quality test,     

138
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,246
        performing a set        
      of musical exercises.     

139
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,750
      the clarinet now goes     
    to the packing department   

140
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,286
       where the packager       
  gently removes fingerprints,  

141
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,389
  lint, and lubricant residue,  

142
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:27,759
 then lays the instrument parts 
     in a velvet-lined case.    

143
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,962
      it's a fitting finale     
 to the making of an instrument 

144
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,599
that looks as good as it sounds.

145
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,625
    narrator: special effects   
        in animated films       

146
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,894
          breathe life          
   into characters and scenes   

147
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,963
 that are completely imaginary. 

148
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,366
     it usually takes a mix     
      of different effects      

149
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:10,168
      to give the fantasy       
      a realistic texture.      

150
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,772
   from miniature-scale models  
 to computer-generated imagery, 

151
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,475
 it's all about the big picture.

152
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,848
          3-d animation         
     and photographic tricks    

153
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,520
   make this miniature village  
  loom large on the big screen. 

154
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,722
          it all starts         
      at the drawing board.     

155
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,125
       an artist sketches       
     the various components     

156
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,293
     of the fantasy village.    

157
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,397
 once he gets it down on paper, 

158
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,667
      the rest of the crew      
          can build it.         

159
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,269
    using one of the sketches   
         as a reference,        

160
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,072
     a sculptor carves foam     
    into sections of a roof,    

161
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,373
     and he glues the pieces    
            together.           

162
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,479
this foam roof will then be used
         to make a mold.        

163
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,553
         the mold maker         
  builds a box around the roof, 

164
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,156
    which is now gray-colored   
     due to the application     

165
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,491
    of a nonstick substance.    

166
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:12,331
 he pours liquid silicon rubber 
 onto the foam roof in the box. 

167
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:20,171
         after 12 hours,        
     they pull apart the box    

168
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,442
       and remove the foam      
       to reveal the mold.      

169
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:27,179
     this mold will be used     
   to cast multiple roof parts  

170
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,514
     for the mini film set.     

171
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,317
       they mix a two-part      
        urethane solution       

172
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,453
   and pour it into the mold.   

173
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,859
       a chemical reaction      
causes the urethane to solidify,

174
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,662
         and as it does,        
 it takes the shape of the mold 

175
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:45,764
      with all the details.     

176
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,070
       after half an hour,      

177
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,207
 he extracts the cured urethane 
         from the mold.         

178
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,644
       it's a perfect copy      
  of the original roof carving. 

179
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:07,285
     they mold various roofs    
      for visual interest.      

180
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,554
      the crew then paints      

181
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,223
      all the molded parts      
     of the mini village set    

182
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,893
in colors that are true to life.

183
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,095
           the palette          
  has been selected beforehand, 

184
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,230
  but if it doesn't look right  
           to the eye,          

185
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,166
    adjustments can be made.    

186
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,640
  for larger-scale structures,  

187
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:32,577
a technician arranges reflective
     dots in a grid pattern.    

188
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,381
           these dots           
    serve as reference points   

189
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,717
     to laser-scan the image    
  of the house into a computer. 

190
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:50,062
    the technician transfers    
 the image a section at a time. 

191
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:54,265
 once the image has been loaded 
       into the computer,       

192
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,467
animators can really play around
            with it.            

193
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,337
         they can insert        
       digital characters       

194
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,975
 or impose a digital image over 
 a filmed one to cast a shadow. 

195
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,079
           meanwhile,           
   another member of the crew   

196
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,882
       plants molded trees      
      onto hills of plastic     

197
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,752
    and shapes the landscape    
           of the set.          

198
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,489
    the trees and vegetation    
      are very small-scale      

199
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,891
      because the landscape     
   will be in the background.   

200
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,833
          in the world          
      of digital animation,     

201
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,902
clumps of moss can mimic shrubs,

202
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,272
       and a hot-glue gun       
    is an indispensable tool.   

203
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,511
         once buildings         
 have been inserted in the set, 

204
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:42,647
  the crew brings up the lights 
     and checks the effect.     

205
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,650
         they add props,        
and, sometimes, take others away

206
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,487
       to improve the look      
         of each scene.         

207
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,324
 technicians tweak the lighting,

208
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,728
   which can add visual depth   
  and credibility to any scene, 

209
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,731
   but it's even more critical  
    with a small-scale vista.   

210
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,470
   little rectangular mirrors   
     attached to the lights     

211
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,140
  allow for minute adjustments. 

212
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,412
   the director of photography  
  operates the camera remotely. 

213
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,949
 adjustments to the shot's frame
        or depth of field       

214
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:21,152
   can trick the eye and make   
  miniatures seem much larger.  

215
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,956
          the computer          
  records the camera movements  

216
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,126
     so they can be repeated    
          at any time.          

217
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:37,435
 later, water will be digitally 
     added to this riverbed.    

218
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,640
    coming up next, animated    
   characters enter the scene   

219
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:45,110
          with the help         
  of computer-generated tricks. 

220
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:05,063
 narrator: today, virtual beings
   are a hollywood phenomenon.  

221
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,132
 computer effects have rocketed 
     3-d animated characters    

222
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,734
       into superstardom,       

223
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,271
 but even for digital creatures,
     fame doesn't come easy.    

224
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,673
     it takes years of work     

225
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,075
        and a large crew        
    of skilled professionals    

226
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,911
     to make them look good     
       on the big screen.       

227
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,085
   it all starts with a good,   
   old-fashioned sketch pad.    

228
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,021
       once the character       
      is defined on paper,      

229
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,724
     the artist sculpts him     
           with clay.           

230
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,500
   then the high-tech wizardry  
             begins             

231
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,836
     as they laser-scan the     
  3-d character from all angles 

232
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,440
       and load the image       
       into the computer.       

233
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,976
    once he's been captured,    

234
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,645
       the computer artist      
       wraps the character      

235
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,181
    in a digital wire frame.    

236
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,517
  he manipulates the wire mesh  

237
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,452
   to make the character move   
          and breathe.          

238
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,724
after he creates a dozen or more
       facial expressions,      

239
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:09,260
 this machine makes hard copies 
      of those many faces.      

240
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,597
     it repeatedly deposits     
        layers of plastic       

241
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,800
 to build up a physical version 
          of the image.         

242
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,676
they insert eyes in the sockets,

243
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,513
   then give these washed-out   
   plastic faces some color.    

244
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:35,120
  an artist paints each one of  
 the faces along the same lines.

245
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,490
     continuity is critical     

246
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:42,093
because the faces will be filmed
 and the images edited together 

247
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,495
            to create           
    the illusion of movement.   

248
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:48,166
  it's a traditional animation  
  technique called stop-motion, 

249
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,770
    and these plastic models    
       are called puppets.      

250
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,245
        next a seamstress       
    builds a suit of clothes    

251
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,180
     for one of the puppets.    

252
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,914
      he has to look great      

253
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,851
because he'll be used to promote
 the character to merchandisers 

254
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,554
 who might market him as a toy. 

255
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,526
they scan the fabric and wrap it
  around the digital character  

256
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,196
  to give him the same outfit,  

257
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,766
        then add creases        
  for a more realistic texture. 

258
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,670
  the crew lights the mini set  

259
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,473
   for one of the character's   
           big scenes           

260
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,475
   and plans the camera moves.  

261
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,944
 it's a kind of dress rehearsal.

262
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,881
     one of the puppets acts    
          as a stand-in         

263
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,452
   for the animated character.  

264
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,890
    they move him around in a   
 process called rough placement.

265
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,225
      it's a critical step      

266
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,960
   which ensures that everyone  
          is in sync --         

267
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,466
        cinematographers,       
lighting artists, and animators.

268
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,104
  seeing the puppet in the room 

269
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,907
       will help animators      
  place his digital counterpart 

270
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,444
     in the various visuals.    

271
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,313
      they literally cover      
         all the angles         

272
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,415
  and leave nothing to chance.  

273
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,722
     now the physical merges    
        with the virtual        

274
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,792
   in a special-effects trick   
  called human motion capture.  

275
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,462
       a man walks around       
       in a special suit        

276
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,398
  covered with reflective dots. 

277
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,402
the computer recognizes the dots
to transfer the man's movements 

278
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,073
   to a version of the digital  
   character instantaneously.   

279
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,749
       the computer artist      
  uses those captured movements 

280
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,820
   to manipulate the character  
 and insert him into the scene. 

281
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,689
        the effect is one       
     of a digital character     

282
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,759
            who moves           
    just like a human being.    

283
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,831
   they layer digitized images  
           of the set           

284
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:04,235
    and blend them seamlessly   
      into a single image.      

285
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,904
     this digital layering      
     is called compositing.     

286
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,239
       it allows animators      

287
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,376
       to accurately place      
   the character in the scene.  

288
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,652
            the blend           
  of high-tech special effects  

289
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,055
        with traditional        
      animation techniques      

290
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,124
 gives the best of both worlds. 

291
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,795
       combined, all these      
     special-effects tricks     

292
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:35,466
   can generate 3-d characters  
       with star quality.       

293
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,268
    they are virtual puppets,   

294
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,804
        and the animators       
       are the puppeteers.      

295
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,606
     and on the big screen,     

296
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,876
           the fantasy          
    has never looked so real.   

297
