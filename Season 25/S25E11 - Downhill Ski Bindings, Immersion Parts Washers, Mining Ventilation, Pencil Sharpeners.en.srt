   discovery communications

00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:55,787
    narrator: the binding is    
 the most important component   

4
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,990
      of a downhill ski.        

5
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,993
    it attaches the ski boot    
          to the ski.           

6
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:05,530
      it prevents injury by     
            releasing           
 the boot if the skier falls.   

7
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,333
   also, an integrated brake    
     engages upon release,      

8
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:13,606
        stopping the ski        
  from sliding down the hill.   

9
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:17,677
   every downhill ski binding   
   has a toe and heel piece.    

10
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,946
        the toe usually         
 releases sideways in a fall,   

11
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:24,083
 and the heel releases upward.  

12
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:27,419
   the earliest bindings were   
              made              
    of heavy stamped steel      

13
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,888
  and had no safety release.    

14
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,760
   today's bindings are made    
   of lightweight material,     

15
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,495
   such as extruded aluminum    

16
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,899
   and fiberglass-reinforced    
           plastic.             

17
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,100
      using 3-d software,       

18
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,702
          the research          
     and development team       

19
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,172
      designs the binding       
 along with the molds and dyes  

20
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,173
      used to manufacture       
        the components.         

21
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:52,177
       the team produces        
 a prototype of each component  

22
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,180
   and uses three-dimensional   
        measuring tools         

23
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,782
 to verify the specifications.  

24
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,653
   workers paint the visible    
      aluminum and plastic      
           components           

25
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:03,990
   then cure them in an oven    
        for 40 minutes.         

26
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,726
       they also dry them       
      at room temperature       

27
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,061
         for 24 hours.          

28
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,165
     this company produces      
    high-end racing models,     

29
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,134
    as well as less expensive   
             models             

30
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,804
          for beginner          
    to intermediate skiers.     

31
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,073
     this aluminum housing      
     is for the toe piece       

32
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,541
     of a racing binding.       

33
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,209
  they screw on plastic tabs    

34
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,479
     to keep the metal from     
            damaging            
     the plastic ski boot.      

35
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,948
     then workers assemble      
        the indicator,          

36
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,818
    which is used to adjust     
     the release setting.       

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,621
 the release setting determines 
   how much torque is needed    

38
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,423
     to trigger the binding     
   to release the ski boot.     

39
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,758
    the torque is generated     

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,827
         by the weight          
     of the skier falling.      

41
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,096
           they place           
   a bronze and aluminum ball   
             joint              

42
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,831
      in the metal base.        

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,032
      the ball joint acts       

44
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,768
    as the rotational center    
       of the toe piece         

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,637
       when it releases.        

46
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,642
 they lubricate the ball joint  
          with grease           

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,613
    before putting the base     
    in an assembly fixture.     

48
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,850
         then they add          
   the toe piece housing...     

49
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:12,658
      ...and a plastic cap      
with a white line on the side.  

50
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,459
  as they screw down the cap,   

51
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,396
         it compresses          
    the spring underneath.      

52
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:29,808
           they test            
    the finished toe piece.     

53
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,077
      this machine stamps       
       the company logo         

54
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,413
 on the heel piece of a binding 
        that's designed         

55
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:38,350
          for beginner          
    to intermediate skiers.     

56
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:42,554
      this one is made of       
 fiberglass-reinforced plastic  

57
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,957
   with a clear polyurethane    
       protective cover.        

58
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,760
    you press the heel piece    
       with the ski pole        

59
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,961
 to get in and out of the ski.  

60
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,532
 next, they mount a heel piece  
           to a base            

61
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,901
          and assemble          
    the internal mechanism.     

62
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,569
this includes a screw-down cap  

63
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,541
 that sets the internal spring  
to a specific release setting.  

64
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,982
      an automated machine      
 tests each heel and toe piece  

65
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,085
   to make sure the mechanism   
     functions correctly.       

66
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,856
        another machine         
   unscrews the cap halfway     

67
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,060
  to lower the release setting  
       to the midpoint.         

68
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,598
       next, a metal pin        
   connects the pivoting top    

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,933
of the heel piece to the base.  

70
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:31,237
   this setting tool locks the  
               pin              
   in its lateral position.     

71
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,676
   now, workers mount the ski   
              brake             
      to the heel piece.        

72
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,878
     the ski boot maintains     
            pressure            
         on the brake           

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,815
      to keep it in the off     
           position.            

74
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,483
       in a ski accident,       
     the fall releases that     
           pressure,            

75
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,553
     triggering the brake.      

76
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,622
       after the binding        

77
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,824
       has been adjusted        
to the length of the ski boot,  

78
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,561
 workers insert a notching pin  
   that locks the heel piece    

79
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,062
     to the mounting plate      
          of the ski.           

80
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:04,570
  these plastic caps hide the   
   heads of the lateral metal   
              pin.              

81
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:09,107
    finally, workers connect    
   this lever to the notching   
              pin.              

82
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,910
           you simply           
      pull it up and back       

83
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:15,981
      to disengage the pin      
  and adjust for boot length.   

84
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,852
  the company subjects random   
   samples from the production  
              line              

85
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,454
          to rigorous           
    quality control tests.      

86
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,925
       bindings are made        
  to international standards.   

87
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,393
    these standards dictate     

88
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,895
 how they're supposed to react  
           to falls.            

89
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,069
      provided the binding      
       is correctly set         

90
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:40,405
    for the skier's weight,     
boot size, and skiing ability,  

91
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:41,607
    these standards ensure      

92
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,808
     the ski boot releases      
        in an accident          

93
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,611
          but doesn't           
     inadvertently release      

94
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,848
 if the skier hits a big bump.  

95
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:07,166
           narrator:            
  removing oil, heavy soils,    

96
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:10,569
    scale, or rust stains on    
a piece of metal can be tough.  

97
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,771
         this is where          
       industrial cleaning      
          technologies          

98
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,838
        come in handy.          

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,707
    immersion parts washers     

100
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,776
         use degreasing         
    and descaling compounds     

101
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,311
        to clean metal.         

102
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:23,249
    they also use ultrasound    
   to literally shake off the   
             muck.              

103
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,985
   an immersion parts washer    

104
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,722
      agitates water mixed      
 with an industrial detergent   

105
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,992
   to clean a mechanical part   
      or piece of metal.        

106
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,394
  a pneumatic lift mechanism    

107
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,463
       moves the platform       
  up and down inside the tank   

108
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,466
       as the water heats       
     to about 150 degrees.      

109
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,340
 a robot loads stainless steel  
     into a laser cutter,       

110
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:53,278
       using suction cups       
to manipulate the sheet metal.  

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,482
       a cnc cutter uses        
      a 2,500 watt laser        

112
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,817
       to cut the steel,        

113
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,620
       following a layout       
   entered in a cad system.     

114
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,022
      the layout maximizes      
      the number of parts       

115
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,392
  made out of a single sheet.   

116
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,164
   the machine parts come out   
   on an unloading platform     

117
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,935
   where an operator performs   
     a visual inspection.       

118
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,973
       he takes the parts       
    to a cnc folding table.     

119
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,841
       the machine bends        
        the sheet metal         

120
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,978
   to form the outside shell    
of the immersion parts washer.  

121
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,647
      this is also called       
        the tank skin.          

122
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,851
  a hydraulic bending machine   
   makes flanges in the sheet   
             metal              

123
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,719
  to reinforce the tank walls   

124
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,256
     and provide a surface      
         for welding.           

125
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,859
         this high-end          
 sheet metal-forming technique  

126
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,528
   allows workers to produce    
       a series of parts        

127
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,165
      for multiple units.       

128
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,137
       a worker assembles       
       the machine parts        

129
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,940
     on a welding fixture.      

130
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,542
         he uses clamps         
  to hold the pieces in place   

131
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:02,147
   as he welds them together    
 using an electric mig torch.   

132
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,883
   welding such a thin sheet    
      of stainless steel        

133
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,418
        is a tricky job         

134
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,554
 because it's more susceptible  
   to warping from the heat.    

135
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,624
     the tank goes through      
      a 24-hour leak test       

136
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,360
       before painting.         

137
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:19,698
       a painter applies        
   epoxy and acrylic hybrid     

138
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,166
  electrostatic powder coat.    

139
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,303
       the coat combines        
   the protective strength of   
             epoxy              

140
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,838
and the resilience of acrylic.  

141
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,511
  the painter places the tank   
in a massive curing chamber...  

142
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,314
     and sets the oven time     
       and temperature.         

143
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,918
       the baking process       
     gives the powder coat      

144
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,321
  a grainy, textured finish.    

145
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,991
      a worker grinds down      
       the weld profiles        

146
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:50,128
    and polishes the top tank   
              walls             
     with fine sandpaper.       

147
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,398
         another worker         
    brings in the lift arm      

148
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,068
  and inserts it in the tank.   

149
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,804
  he puts the bearing support   
      mechanism in place        

150
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,173
  and bolts it onto the tank.   

151
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,676
    he inserts the rollers      

152
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,680
  that will support and guide   
        the lift arm...         

153
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:12,418
      then drives a shaft       
     through the bearings.      

154
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,157
          he installs           
    the pneumatic cylinder      

155
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,692
  behind the bearing support    

156
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,063
          and pins it           
    on top of the lift arm.     

157
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,505
he brings in the agitator pump  

158
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,308
        and installs its        
 3/4-horsepower electric motor  

159
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,111
 next to the bearing support.   

160
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:43,448
     a plumber installs the     
            fittings            
     for the tank filter.       

161
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,584
       the filter removes       
   contamination and debris     

162
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:50,322
  from the cleaning solution.   

163
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:55,927
 a worker installs the platform 
 and bolts it on the lift arm.  

164
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,130
       he installs a rack       
       on the platform.         

165
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,731
it's made of grainy fiberglass  

166
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,933
     to prevent the pieces      
         from shifting          

167
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,136
   during a cleaning cycle.     

168
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:05,737
  after testing the movement    

169
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,339
        of the lift arm         
    and platform assembly,      

170
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,545
        workers install         
 the steel lid on the tank...   

171
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,881
     and attach its hinge.      

172
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:21,353
        then they check         
      the fit of the lid.       

173
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,288
      an electrician makes      
        the connections         

174
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,224
          for the heat          
     and timer controls...      

175
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:32,664
   ...and screws the electric   
              panel             
  onto the side of the tank.    

176
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,570
  he closes the electric box,   

177
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:43,208
    then tests the lift arm,    
    the lid, and the agitator   
             pump.              

178
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,180
   as the lift arm moves up,    

179
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,618
 the platform lifts clean parts 
       out of the water.        

180
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,387
     washers like this one      
      can clean anything        

181
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,125
    from automotive castings    
   to printing press parts.     

182
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,476
           narrator:            
    in an underground mine,     

183
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:22,147
    ventilation is critical     
 for the safety of the miners.  

184
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,951
       above-ground fans        
 can either blow in fresh air   

185
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,087
   or they can suck out toxic   
              gases             
    using ventilation ducts     

186
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,624
   suspended from the ceiling   
      of the mine shaft.        

187
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,364
  the black ventilation ducts   
    are made of fiberglass.     

188
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,633
        the yellow ducts        
       are made of vinyl        

189
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,268
  reinforced with steel wire.   

190
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,906
 both are designed to withstand 
       negative pressure        

191
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,242
    when drawing out gases      

192
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,445
     and positive pressure      
     when blowing in air.       

193
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,849
         to manufacture         
 sections of fiberglass duct,   

194
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,785
   they use a steel mandrel.    

195
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,188
      workers wrap plastic      
      around the mandrel        

196
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,258
   to prevent the fiberglass    
        from sticking.          

197
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,728
    they also wrap cardboard    
             around             
 one end of each duct section   

198
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,130
   to increase its diameter.    

199
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,734
      next, they start up       
     the fiberglass winding     
            machine.            

200
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,070
            it draws            
    29 strands of fiberglass    
             roving             

201
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:21,606
   through a bath of resin,     

202
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,077
        then winds them         
      in a helical pattern    u 

203
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,146
  building up a layer between   
  3 and 10 millimeters thick,   

204
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,749
 depending on the application.  

205
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,619
   the regular end is called    
          the spigot.           

206
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,289
   the wide end is called the   
             bell.              

207
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,024
the spigot of one duct section  

208
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:42,093
          fits snugly           
 inside the bell of the next.   

209
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:47,565
  this way, multiple sections   
    can be connected to each    
             other.             

210
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,634
     workers embed d-rings      

211
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,137
      at regular intervals      
        along the top.          

212
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,508
      these rings are used      
     to suspend the ducts       

213
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,877
 from the mine shaft ceiling.   

214
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:08,186
 once the winding is finished,  
   workers cut the roving...    

215
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,325
          ...and roll           
the fiberglass-covered mandrel  

216
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,861
 into a large oven for curing.  

217
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,931
   it takes about 30 minutes    
       to cure the resin        

218
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,733
     on a duct this size.       

219
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:27,138
        once it's cured,        
   they extract the mandrel.    

220
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,342
  they saw through the middle   
    of the fiberglass duct      

221
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,944
     to divide it into two      
shorter ducts of equal length.  

222
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,782
      each has a bell end       
       and a spigot end.        

223
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,818
    workers use a hand saw      

224
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,221
  to cut and shape some pieces  
        into fittings.          

225
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,624
      fittings are angled       
     or "y"-shaped pieces       

226
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,894
        that connect two        
       straight pieces,         

227
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,029
            allowing            
   the route of the ducting     

228
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,165
    to turn or branch out.      

229
00:13:54,167 --> 00:14:00,038
  they connect the cut pieces   
  with galvanized metal tape,   

230
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,043
    then they seal the gaps     

231
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,315
    with strips of fiberglass   
              cloth             
     saturated with resin.      

232
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,326
     to make spiral duct,       

233
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,994
       they weld together       
        sheets of vinyl         

234
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,263
   to create a wider sheet.     

235
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,669
    on one end of the tube,     
      they weld in a ring       

236
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,438
 made of galvanized wire rope.  

237
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,077
 at the other end of the tube,  

238
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,280
          they weld in          
    an adjustable coupler.      

239
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,688
   to connect duct sections,    

240
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,223
    the ring of one section     

241
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,793
     fits into the coupler      
       of the next one.         

242
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,099
      they mount the tube       
       on the guide bar         

243
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,034
of the spiral winding machine.  

244
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,507
 the machine applies steel wire 
    to reinforce the vinyl.     

245
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:14,446
    it also enables the duct    
             section            
   to collapse into a compact   
             hoop.              

246
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,581
      as it works its way       
        down the tube,          

247
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,885
  the machine covers the wire   
    with a strip of vinyl.      

248
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,390
    it welds the vinyl to the   
              tube,             
       forming a pocket         

249
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,859
    that both locks the wire    
          in position           

250
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,228
  and protects it from wear.    

251
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,133
    when the machine reaches    
 the opposite end of the tube,  

252
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,136
       they cut the wire        
 and remove the duct section.   

253
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,808
         the last step          
     is to attach hangers       

254
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,944
     at 2-foot intervals.       

255
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,480
      the hangers are used      
   to suspend the ventilation   
             ducts              

256
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,348
    from the mine ceiling.      

257
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,350
          spiral ducts          
     are the easiest type       

258
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,686
  of ventilation to transport   
          and install           

259
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,689
  because they're collapsible   
       and lightweight.         

260
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,761
 however, they can get damaged  
  in high-traffic work areas,   

261
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,029
    so mines prefer to use      

262
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:07,165
      sturdier fiberglass       
      ventilation ducts.        

263
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,982
           narrator:            
 before the pencil sharpener,   

264
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,320
       people used knives       
     to sharpen the tips of     
            pencils.            

265
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,321
it was in the mid-19th century  

266
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,524
     when a french inventor     
 came up with a clever tool --  

267
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,062
   a little box with a blade    
  and a cone-shaped opening.    

268
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,797
just twist the pencil into it,  

269
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,900
          and it makes          
     a very precise point.      

270
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,072
 the pencil sharpener has been  
 a favorite of pencil pushers   

271
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:52,077
      for over 150 years.       

272
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,080
      with a few twists,        

273
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,482
          it can hone           
 the graphite tip of a pencil   

274
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,885
     to a very fine point.      

275
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,623
  to make pencil sharpeners,    

276
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:09,361
        they start with         
       high-carbon steel for th 

277
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,763
       the steel unwinds        
    through a straightener,     

278
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:15,433
   then a feeder serves it up   
       to a punchcutter.        

279
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,570
    it cuts out five blades     
        in one action,          

280
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,373
  complete with assembly holes  
        in the center.          

281
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,709
        it also embosses        
   the company logo onto it.    

282
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,179
   this machine can generate    

283
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,448
           well over            
    100,000 pencil sharpener    
             blades             

284
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,416
          in an hour.           

285
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,657
    a worker distributes the    
             blades             
        onto a conveyor         

286
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,227
    that will take them to an   
             oven.              

287
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:55,140
     the temperature inside     
       is 1,500 degrees.        

288
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,276
    the blades slowly circle    
         in the oven.           

289
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,813
        this step takes         
       15 to 20 minutes.        

290
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,150
  exposure to the intense heat  
  and a quick cooldown in oil   

291
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,018
      harden the blades,        

292
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,554
          but it also           
    leaves them tarnished.      

293
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,955
     so they drain the oil      

294
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,891
     by spinning the blades     
     in a perforated drum.      

295
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,293
      then they add a mix       
         of dried corn          

296
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,130
      and polishing paste       
        to the blades.          

297
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,439
   the drum tosses the blades   
    in the polishing medium     

298
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,708
    for six 6 to 12 hours.      

299
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,911
      this restores them,       

300
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,448
           as we see            
in this before-and-after shot.  

301
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,385
  a circular feeder sorts them  
      into a single file        

302
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,321
and racks them on a metal rod.  

303
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,122
       once on the rod,         

304
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,260
   a machine grinds a cutting   
              edge              
    into all of the blades at   
             once.              

305
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,397
             next,              
 they manufacture the housing   

306
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,867
    for the pencil sharpener    
            blades.             

307
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,602
         a circular saw         
  cuts a ridged magnesium bar   

308
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,505
    to the correct length.      

309
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,608
      the magnesium blocks      
     tumble into a feeder,      

310
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,246
       which funnels them       
   into a stamping machine.     

311
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,818
       the machine stamps       
       the company logo         

312
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,355
          onto the top          
 and lower side of the blocks.  

313
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,690
        machinery moves         

314
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,893
  the pencil sharpener bodies   
      forward to a drill        

315
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:26,297
    that bores cone-shaped,     
 pencil-sized holes into them.  

316
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,369
         a second drill         
    carves holes in the top     

317
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,374
  for screwing the blades into  
 the pencil sharpener bodies.   

318
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,646
   a little metal rod shoves    
  the pencil sharpener bodies   

319
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,115
       out of the machine       
        and into a bin.         

320
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,587
        a worker plunges        
  the pencil sharpener bodies   

321
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,457
   into five chemical baths.    

322
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,126
         each bath has          
     a different formula.       

323
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,530
 the chemicals soften the edges 
   of the magnesium bodies,     

324
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,499
  making the surface shinier.   

325
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,338
        a worker spreads        
  the pencil sharpener bodies   

326
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,673
    across a mesh conveyor.     

327
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,142
    the conveyor takes them     
        through a dryer         

328
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,810
     to remove any residue      

329
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,213
          left behind           
  by the chemical solutions.    

330
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,453
 these pencil sharpener bodies  
    are now ready to receive    
            blades.             

331
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:30,495
 a feeder system delivers them  
    to an assembly station.     

332
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:31,829
       the screws funnel        

333
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,665
 into an automated screwdriver  
    at the assembly point.      

334
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,102
 a mechanism slides the blades  

335
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,005
    into the pencil sharpener   
             bodies             
        as they arrive.         

336
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:51,849
   the pencil sharpeners fall   
 into a bin, ready for retail.  

337
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,252
           it's taken           
   many different processes     

338
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,222
   to produce these magnesium   
      pencil sharpeners.        

339
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,659
here's a recap of the process.  

340
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,134
   over a century and a half    
     after its invention,       

341
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:13,137
  the manual pencil sharpener   
 is still making life easier.   

342
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,806
   and in modern factories,     

343
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:19,043
   the concept has been honed   
       to a fine point.
