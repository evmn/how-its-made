  beveling it from the spine to 
 the cutting edge on both sides.

275
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:17,002
   then sanding belts are used

284

into a handle end cap or pommel.

285
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,535
   the center hole will house   
            the tang.           

286
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,673
    he slices other pieces of   
 the material almost wafer thin.

287
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:58,009
     they'll become spacers     
   for the handle's other end.  

288
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,945
    these compound parts will   
   support the center material  

289
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,614
      for the cork handle.      

290
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,420
 the craftsman stacks the parts 
    of the handle on a stand.   

291
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,357
   he brushes waterproof glue   
         onto the spacer        

292
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,960
 and slides eight pieces of cork
         onto the prong.        

293
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,963
         he applies glue        
        between each one.       

294
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:21,766
      he places the pommel      
        piece on the end.       

295
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,501
     since cork is buoyant,     

296
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,303
          if the knife          
      is dropped in water,      

297
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,040
          it will float         
  and can be easily retrieved.  

298
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,577
once the glue dries, the handles
        are transferred,        

299
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,846
  two at a time, to a fixture.  

300
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,916
the fixture moves back and forth
  as a rotor rounds the spacer, 

301
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,452
carving the cork and the pommel.

302
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,855
      at the next station,      
         a worker places        

303
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:48,460
        one of the fillet       
knife blades in a rubber holder.

304
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,594
      he clamps the holder      
          in a fixture,         

305
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:55,132
    stabilizing the blade for   
the installation of the bolster.

306
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,536
  the bolster is the steel ring 
 that acts as a transition piece

307
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,072
  between the blade and handle. 

308
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,074
 then the craftsman applies glue

309
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,476
     to the composite spacer    
         on the handle.         

310
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,580
      he slides the handle      
   onto the tang of the knife.  

311
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,353
   he inserts a hexagonal nut   
  into the hole and the pommel  

312
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,423
     as well as some epoxy.     

313
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,825
he screws the nut onto the tang,

314
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,428
       securing the blade       
         to the handle.         

315
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,899
       the epoxy provides       
         reinforcement.         

316
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:32,704
the craftsman unclamps the knife
and works on shaping the handle.

317
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,306
  he sculpts it with rough-grit 
           sandpaper.           

318
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,180
      he angles the outside     
         of the pommel,         

319
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,518
       making it smoother       
      and more attractive.      

320
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,853
 switching to a finer abrasive, 

321
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,990
        he sands the cork       
  to blend the layers together  

322
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,893
      so they appear to be      
       one uniform piece.       

323
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,331
      next, a worker drills     
         into the pommel        

324
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,800
 to widen and slope the opening.

325
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,604
       he pipes more epoxy      
        into the recess.        

326
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,005
        he inserts a snap       

327
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,809
        that will be used       
 to retain the knife in a sheath

328
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:15,813
      and drives it further     
 into the recess using a press. 

329
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,816
      once the epoxy cures,     

330
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,552
          he submerges          
     the knives into water.     

331
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:24,622
 this step is a test to confirm 
      the knives can float.     

332
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,424
     after the handle dries,    

333
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,493
       the knife undergoes      
         a final sanding        

334
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,595
for the user's gripping comfort.

335
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,833
   you can see the difference   
        the sanding makes       

336
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:36,568
   in the knife on the right.   

337
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,373
  next, the craftsman works on  
the fillet knife's cutting edge,

338
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,743
      sharpening it against     
         a sanding belt.        

339
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:50,915
   the blade slices a sheet of  
 paper cleanly without snagging,

340
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,084

341
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:59,858
 finally, another worker cleans 
and lubricates the fillet knife.

342
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,926
          she slides it

343
