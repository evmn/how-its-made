00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,721
narrator: the first fireplaces were strictly functional    

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,191
for heating the home, cooking meals,         

5
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,193
and warming water for bathing. 

6
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:04,997
over time, fireplaces appeared in other rooms of the house  

7
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,532
and acquired ascetic features such as wood,         

8
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,468
stone, or tile work.      

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,741
this ceramic fireplace is a heritage model      

10
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,277
inspired by fireplaces of the late 19th        

11
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,746
and early 20th century.    

12
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,950
certain tiles         
are exact replicas of originals.

13
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:30,122
at the ceramic factory they mix water with clay,   

14
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:34,026
feldspar, and silica in a pugmill.         

15
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,162
together, these formulate a clay blend. 

16
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,298
once the mix is the right consistency,   

17
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,233
the operator presses a button, 

18
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,769
and the mill switches to extrusion mode.  

19
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:48,107
this forces the clay blend through a mantel shaped die  

20
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:52,578
and produces a 10- to 15-inch long extruded mantel piece.  

21
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,380
they trim the piece with a cutting wire      

22
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,783
to the precise length required.

23
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,721
they use this extrusion method for making longer pieces.   

24
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,456
if they need shorter ones   

25
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,692
they often cast them individually in a mold.    

26
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,097
when casting they add significantly more water    

27
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,134
to the clay blend to produce a liquid clay called slip.   

28
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:18,070
they pour the slip into a plaster mold.      

29
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:21,807
the porous plaster gradually absorbs most of the water,   

30
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:24,476
leaving a layer of clay about 6 millimeters thick   

31
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,813
on the walls of the mantel-shaped cavity.  

32
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,417
after a few hours, they pour out the excess slip 

33
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:35,254
and open the mold to extract the cast mantel piece.     

34
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,492
once the clay becomes firm enough to handle     

35
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,628
they carefully trim off the excess           

36
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:45,331
around the opening in the mold.

37
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,367
then they gently smooth down the seam            

38
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:53,706
along the junction between the two halves of the mold.  

39
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,841
on the opposite side of the pour hole,       

40
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,044
they cut out a matching hole. 

41
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,646
this will help the clay dry faster           

42
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:05,217
by enabling air to flow through
the inside of the piece.    

43
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,587
to compensate for shrinkage,  

44
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:12,391
the molds and extrusion dies are designed 11% larger    

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,060
than the size of the finished piece.     

46
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:17,863
clay shrinks as it dries.   

47
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,332
to make the fireplace's ceramic tiles,         

48
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,535
they produce a rubber mold of two adjoining tiles     

49
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,738
and place it inside a metal casing.     

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,074
they also include a release system to help with extraction.

51
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,543
they fill the casing      

52
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:33,011
with an exceptionally strong type of plaster.        

53
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,014
it sets in about half an hour, 

54
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,682
taking on the shape of the rubber mold.      

55
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,351
this plaster casting      

56
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,554
is the die they'll now use to produce the tiles.     

57
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,424
they mount the die on what's known as a ram press 

58
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,828
because it literally rams a block of clay in the die   

59
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,964
and compresses it with 30 tons of pressure.   

60
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:58,504
the tile die is also 11% larger
than the final size      

61
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,574
to compensate for shrinkage during drying and firing.   

62
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,443
they remove excess clay    

63
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:08,914
and send it back to the pugmill
to be recycled.        

64
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,317
then they position a board under the die         

65
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,451
and activate the release system,

66
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:17,223
which extracts the clay with a blast of compressed air.

67
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,764
they trim off the excess clay. 

68
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,869
once dry,           

69
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:33,205
the tiles and mantel pieces are ready to be glazed.    

70
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,341
glaze is a chemical formula  

71
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,744
containing finely ground silica

72
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:41,013
combined with different combinations  

73
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,083
of metallic elements to produce specific colors.  

74
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,418
they use a spray gun      

75
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:50,088
to apply glaze to the mantels and a tube tip applicator   

76
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:51,924
to glaze the tiles.      

77
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:58,697
the tiles design has raised borders between its components.

78
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,899
these are called cuenca lines. 

79
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,701
they prevent the different colored glazes         

80
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,171
from flowing into each other. 

81
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,578
the glazed mantel piece and tiles           

82
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:18,517
now go into a gas-fired kiln for 12 to 14 hours.      

83
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,921
the high temperature, 2,100 degrees fahrenheit,   

84
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,989
triggers chemical reactions  

85
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,925
which harden and strengthen the pieces.          

86
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,061
the clay's mineral composition transforms           

87
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,196
into a completely new configuration         

88
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,132
of crystals and glass.     

89
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:37,202
as for the glaze, its precise 
formulation of metallic elements

90
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,271
produces a specific color,   

91
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,874
and the silica melts into a glass surface.     

92
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,677
the ceramics are now smooth and shiny    

93
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,947
and ready to transform an otherwise ordinary fireplace

94
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:50,950
into a work of art.      

95
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,230
narrator: many winemakers choose to seal their bottles  

96
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,767
with synthetic closures instead
of natural cork from tree bark.

97
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,502
this prevents cork taint,   

98
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,437
which happens when natural cork

99
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,173
gets contaminated by the tca molecule.      

100
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,911
cork taint is completely harmless to humans,      

101
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,580
but spoils the taste of the wine.          

102
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:26,518
this engineered cork is entirely synthetic     

103
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:30,455
and therefore resistant to tca contamination.     

104
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,659
it's made of a food-grade polyethylene foam core     

105
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,529
encased in elasticized polymer skin.  

106
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,533
both materials contract    
to squeeze inside the bottleneck

107
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,201
but then regain their original shape      

108
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,337
to seal the opening.      

109
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,872
to make the foam core,     

110
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,409
they mix talc with pellets of low density polyethylene,  

111
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,944
a pliable type of plastic.   

112
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,948
then they add pellets     
of dark brown and beige colorant

113
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,385
to mimic the wood grain look of natural cork.        

114
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,288
for each customer's order of corks,        

115
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,224
a computerized system automatically releases     

116
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:08,427
the right amount of each ingredient       

117
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,963
into an industrial blender.  

118
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:15,300
the blender feeds a specially 
designed dual extrusion machine.

119
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:18,704
the machine melts the foam mix to a liquid state       

120
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,239
then injects carbon dioxide.  

121
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,775
this produces bubbles,     

122
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:26,445
which create the cellular structure of the foam.     

123
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,381
the liquid foam enters the machine's horizontal extruder, 

124
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:33,986
while elasticized polymer enters
the machine's angled extruder. 

125
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,320
both extruders         

126
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,189
squeeze their materials through the same shaping die, 

127
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,593
which outputs a continuous rod of skin-encased foam.     

128
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:45,431
the foam core immediately expands.      

129
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,665
the elastic skin stretches with it.       

130
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,469
a water bath cools the rod,  

131
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,872
halting this expansion at a specific diameter.    

132
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,141
then, an underwater ultrasonic gauge        

133
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,411
measures the thickness of the outer skin       

134
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,147
to make sure it meets specifications.    

135
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,951
the rod exits the water bath  

136
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,588
and continues cooling and shrinking as it drip dries.

137
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,828
a laser gauge then verifies that the rod is perfectly round

138
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:19,198
and measures a specific diameter
by this point.         

139
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,034
when any of the measuring gauges

140
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,504
detects an area that doesn't meet specifications,      

141
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,374
that part of the rod is flagged in the system    

142
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,643
and is discarded at the end of the production line.    

143
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:38,850
the rod now enters the final cooling phase.    

144
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,355
it travels in several loops past
nozzles spraying cold water.  

145
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,197
as the rod cools, it shrinks to its final size, 

146
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:56,334
a diameter of between 22 and 23 millimeters.     

147
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,070
it's designed to fit snugly  

148
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:02,274
inside the standard 18.5-millimeter bottle opening.

149
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,413
they had to calculate exactly how wide to extrude the rod  

150
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:11,216
so that after expansion then shrinkage,        

151
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,319
it would end up at this precise diameter.   

152
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,623
the rod now enters a cutter.  

153
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,161
the blade is so sharp that a safety cover is mandatory.  

154
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,963
it's removed here only for the camera.      

155
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:35,040
the winery placing the order specifies the cork length.   

156
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,509
air jets automatically blow off
any corks           

157
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,312
cut from areas the measuring gauges flagged  

158
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,713
as being problematic.     

159
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,853
the cutter slices about 10 standard-length corks 

160
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,621
per second.          

161
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,462
all the good corks land on the conveyor belt   

162
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,464
and travel to the end of the line,    

163
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,533
where computer sensors count them           

164
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,002
as they drop into a collection bin.     

165
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,941
additional machines print on the winery's name and logo, 

166
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,878
and lubricate the surface with silicone         

167
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,482
so the corks will glide in   
and out of the bottle with ease.

168
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:26,125
the factory's on-site lab tests samples from every order.

169
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,028
sensory specialists sniff each cork        

170
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,298
and compare it to a control sample.      

171
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,233
there must be no discernible odor      

172
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:39,104
that might affect the aroma or flavor of the wine.     

173
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:43,575
if there is, the entire order of corks fails inspection.   

174
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,248
while natural cork is designed by mother nature, 

175
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,317
a synthetic cork manufacturer can engineer the closure    

176
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,854
to fit more or less snugly according to the amount of air 

177
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,658
the particular wine needs to develop correctly.     

178
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,009
narrator: multi-tiered parking garages  

179
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,277
have become an urban phenomenon.

180
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,080
with each floor added to the garage      

181
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,817
the number of parking spaces increases.           

182
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,220
in crowded cities where land is limited,     

183
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,256
garages like these are a necessity.        

184
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:39,898
they build parking garages one concrete slab at a time.  

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,234
these slabs are known as double-t's         

186
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,972
because the two support beams 
are in a double-t configuration.

187
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,708
double-t's are often factory made          

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,510
and transported to the construction site later.

189
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,114
they are designed to hold up under very heavy loads.    

190
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,319
they make these slabs outdoors.

191
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:04,523
wind blows dirt onto the molds,
so they sweep it clean.    

192
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:07,125
this mold is about 500 feet long

193
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:11,263
and will be used to make several slabs.     

194
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,533
they spray an oil-based release agent onto it.     

195
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:17,936
the release agent will allow  
the slabs to be easily extracted

196
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,805
when complete, preventing cracking.      

197
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,609
they spread it more evenly using mops.          

198
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,879
this release agent bonds to the metal quickly      

199
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,350
and won't wash off easily if it happens to rain.     

200
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,354
they're now ready to assemble 

201
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,690
the floor slab's elaborate support structure.       

202
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,027
they prop up the ends of each slab          

203
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,329
with galvanized steel stirrups.

204
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,503
they place l-shaped bearing plates         

205
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:54,506
in strategic locations along the mold.        

206
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,179
then they insert wooden blocks in the mold.          

207
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:04,650
these blocks will form notches in the cast concrete      

208
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,420
that will be used to join the slabs during construction. 

209
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,725
next, workers thread high-strength steel cables   

210
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,262
called tendons throughout the beam sections of the mold. 

211
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:21,599
they pull the ends through holes
to the outside of the mold   

212
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,201
and clamp them.        

213
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:31,009
a worker tucks another wood block between two tendons   

214
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,410
to complete the notch part of the mold          

215
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,946
and hold the tendons in place. 

216
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,217
the team threads more tendons throughout the mold,      

217
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,688
weaving a strategic support structure. 

218
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,563
to separate each cast slab, they insert wooden dividers  

219
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,266
with slots that accommodate the tendons. 

220
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,040
they adjust the location of each of the stirrups    

221
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,044
so that they sit at a specific spot near the dividers.    

222
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:18,223
with the final tendons in place,
they bring in a hydraulic jack.

223
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:25,564
the worker attaches it to one 
of the protruding steel tendons.

224
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,536
he activates the jack, and it pulls the tendon    

225
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,839
until it's stretched tight like a rubber band.      

226
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,878
he pulls the rest of the tendons
with the jack         

227
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,814
and checks the tension to confirm           

228
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,884
that it's exactly the same for each one.         

229
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,756
pulled tight and later released,

230
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,625
the cables will hold the concrete under compression,

231
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,460
adding strength to it.     

232
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,633
without it, the concrete slabs 

233
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:06,238
would never be able to support the weight of many vehicles.  

234
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,574
the next worker ties a plastic bracket to the stirrups    

235
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,710
to set them at the right height.

236
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,050
he inserts metal mesh into the mold         

237
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,253
where each slab will end.   

238
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,921
this will help disperse    

239
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:26,390
some of the concentrated bearing stresses.       

240
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,392
he stabilizes the mesh,    

241
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,196
and reinforces it with the support structure.  

242
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,737
the team places plastic pockets

243
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,807
along the tops of the beam sections of the mold.     

244
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,278
these pockets will be used to chain the slab to the truck 

245
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,614
during transport.       

246
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,884
they'll also act as entry points
for electrical wiring     

247
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,521
and hold controls for parking space counting equipment.   

248
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,027
coming up next,        

249
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,097
the deck section gets plenty of extra support, 

250
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,567
and then it's set in concrete. 

251
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,319
narrator: the average car weighs well over 2,000 pounds, 

252
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,986
so each parking garage floor  

253
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,856
must hold up many times that weight.    

254
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,658
double-t concrete slabs make this possible.      

255
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,528
each slab has two reinforcing beams,   

256
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,063
and each beam has a tense steel skeleton   

257
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:42,601
that compresses the concrete, making it stronger.      

258
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,072
with the steel tendons     

259
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,273
stretched through the beam parts
of the mold,          

260
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,944
workers now lay metal mesh across the deck.        

261
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,347
this mesh is known as welded wire fabric,     

262
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,951
and it will reinforce     
the surface of the parking slab.

263
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,223
they tie the welded wire together            

264
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,859
for full coverage across the deck.        

265
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,365
they use plastic clips to prop up the wire      

266
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,666
so that when they pour the concrete,       

267
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,102
it will envelop both sides.  

268
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,771
they insert handles      

269
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,441
that will protrude from the ends
of the completed slab     

270
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:27,111
to allow it to be lifted for transport and installation.

271
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,083
there are four double handles in each parking floor slab.  

272
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:39,658
they enmesh the prongs of weld plates in the steel grid.   

273
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,926
the plates are strategically positioned  

274
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,764
for the welding of the slab to other pieces of concrete.  

275
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,635
all the prep work is finally done,        

276
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,837
and they pour the concrete.  

277
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,677
the concrete flows into the beam
sections of the mold first,  

278
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:02,480
and then workers spread the overflow across the deck. 

279
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,549
this is a high-performance formula            

280
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:08,887
that's known in the industry as self-consolidating concrete.

281
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,489
it flows evenly into tight spaces       

282
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:16,027
and compacts better without the need for much vibrating.  

283
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:18,896
this leveler vibrates the surface of the concrete  

284
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,766
only slightly as it evens it out.      

285
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,238
they then rake the surface of the slab          

286
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,041
to allow another layer of concrete to adhere to it  

287
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,110
later during construction.   

288
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,116
they now insert arced metal bars

289
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,586
into slots on the sides of the mold    

290
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,723
to form a ribbed framework down the length of it.     

291
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,728
this serves as a support structure for a tent.     

292
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,929
they unroll the tarp from a huge spool       

293
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,898
and drape it over the ribbing. 

294
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,672
they secure the canvas to the sides of the mold    

295
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,475
with hooks.          

296
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,278
the tent will shelter the concrete          

297
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,814
from the wind and rain as it cures.          

298
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,686
along with an additional plastic layer,         

299
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:18,623
it will contain the hot and  
humid conditions created inside.

300
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,559
the heat accelerates the curing
of the concrete,        

301
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:25,429
and the humidity prevents cracking.       

302
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,901
the cure takes 16 hours, and then they roll up the tarp.

303
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36,441
using a torch, they cut the steel tendons   

304
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,911
and place the concrete under compression.       

305
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:43,114
the cuts also separate the slabs.    

306
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:48,553
a driver now parks his crane over one of the slabs.     

307
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,324
workers attach the hooks of the crane          

308
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,761
to the protruding handles at the ends of the slab.    

309
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:03,534
they signal the crane operator,
and he activates the lift.   

310
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,937
thanks to the release agent applied earlier,        

311
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:09,407
the concrete slab easily dislodges from the mold.

312
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,941
it's a heavy load.       

313
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,578
each slab weighs 40,000 pounds.

314
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,349
the crane sets it down     

315
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,653
and the team inspects the slab for defects.          

316
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,291
satisfied that the slab is free of flaws,       

317
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,828
a worker trims the protruding steel tendons  

318
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,796
flush to the concrete.     

319
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,568
another worker spreads a concrete-like paste 

320
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,171
on the exposed ends of the severed steel      

321
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,307
to seal it from the elements. 

322
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:52,383
then a worker glues rubber pads
to the bearing plates.     

323
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,584
they'll act as cushions    

324
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,120
when the slab sits on another concrete beam.   

325
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,825
he wraps some tape around them while the adhesive sets.    

326
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:08,733
this parking garage floor slab is now ready to join the rest. 

327
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,067
side-by-side,         

328
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,138
the slabs will form one large parking surface   

329
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,874
to create even more spaces.
