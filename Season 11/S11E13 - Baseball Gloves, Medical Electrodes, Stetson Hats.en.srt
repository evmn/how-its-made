blanket of dust that must be    
held down by wet cotton mesh.   
for extra protection, a worker

00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,951
held down by wet cotton mesh.   
for extra protection, a worker  
wraps burlap onto the cone and  

309
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:11,589
for extra protection, a worker  
wraps burlap onto the cone and  
puts a metal cover over it.     

310
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,591
wraps burlap onto the cone and

he weighs it down and gives the

he weighs it down and gives the 
fur cone a good soaking in a vat

312
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,961
he weighs it down and gives the 
fur cone a good soaking in a vat
of hot, soapy water to make the

of hot, soapy water to make the 
fur fibers curl up and lock

00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,500
of hot, soapy water to make the 
fur fibers curl up and lock     
together.                       

315
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,636
fur fibers curl up and lock     
together.                       
shortly after, the worker peels

00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,138
together.                       
shortly after, the worker peels 
the newly formed felted fur

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,941
shortly after, the worker peels 
the newly formed felted fur     
blanket off the cone.

the cones from damage by        
wrapping them in cloth.         
then, she puts them through a

the rollers in the hot-water

00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,313
the final and most aggressive   
massage makes the fibers felt   
together even tighter, and the  

333
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,849
massage makes the fibers felt   
together even tighter, and the  
cone is now strong enough to

them through a final hardening  
stage that shrinks and tightens

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,933
them through a final hardening  
stage that shrinks and tightens 
the fur fibers to the maximum.

stage that shrinks and tightens 
the fur fibers to the maximum.

at last, the fragile cone that

two days later, a worker inserts
blocks into the hat, which are

00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,926
two days later, a worker inserts
blocks into the hat, which are  
color-coded for size.           

408
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,461
blocks into the hat, which are  
color-coded for size.           
the blocks fit the hat on a     

409
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,095
color-coded for size.           
the blocks fit the hat on a     
pouncing machine that gently    

410
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:54,037
the blocks fit the hat on a     
pouncing machine that gently    
spins and sands the felt.

pouncing machine that gently    
spins and sands the felt.       
this unsanded felt gets buffed  

412

spins and sands the felt.       
this unsanded felt gets buffed  
until the hat ends up with

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,711
this unsanded felt gets buffed  
until the hat ends up with      
the smoothest finish possible.  

414
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,713
until the hat ends up with      
the smoothest finish possible.  
then a worker puts the hat onto 

415
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,615
the smoothest finish possible.  
then a worker puts the hat onto 
a hydraulic crown press.        

416
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,717
then a worker puts the hat onto 
a hydraulic crown press.        
inside it, he places a piece of 

417
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,086
a hydraulic crown press.        
inside it, he places a piece of 
ink transfer paper and a heated 

418
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,288
inside it, he places a piece of 
ink transfer paper and a heated 
aluminum mold.                  

419
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,723
ink transfer paper and a heated 
aluminum mold.                  
he lowers the press and applies 

420
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,225
aluminum mold.                  
he lowers the press and applies 
the exact amount of pressure    

421
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,926
he lowers the press and applies 
the exact amount of pressure    
needed to mold a specific shape 

422
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,829
the exact amount of pressure    
needed to mold a specific shape 
into the crown.                 

423
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,597

on this particular hat, the     
press imprints the logo inside. 

425
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,239
on this particular hat, the     
press imprints the logo inside. 
now the crown has a distinct

427
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,808
now the crown has a distinct    
shape.                          
a worker then puts the hat on a 

428
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,510

brim cutter and holds it down   
flat with a cutting guide.      

430
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,384
brim cutter and holds it down   
flat with a cutting guide.      
she cuts the brim to the        

431
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,452
flat with a cutting guide.      
she cuts the brim to the        
required dimension and removes

00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:48,759
she cuts the brim to the        
required dimension and removes  
the excess felt and the guide.  

433
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,595
required dimension and removes  
the excess felt and the guide.  
a worker then puts the hat into 

434
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,496
the excess felt and the guide.  
a worker then puts the hat into

he then puts the hat onto an    
identical wooden shape and      

439
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,974
he then puts the hat onto an    
identical wooden shape and      
covers it to keep its form while

441
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,444
covers it to keep its form while
cooling.                        
once cooled, this hat will keep

once cooled, this hat will keep 
its symmetrical curves that     

443
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,380
once cooled, this hat will keep 
its symmetrical curves that     
will make it so distinctively   

444
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:16,787
its symmetrical curves that     
will make it so distinctively   
western.                        

445
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,655
