00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,857
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
...yacht wheels...       

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,899
...braided rugs...       

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,838
...automobile thermostats...  

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,778
...and chisels.        

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,321
a wheel is a fairly modern way to steer a boat.        

9
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,722
before the 18th century,    

10
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,126
captains shifted a stake    
attached directly to the rudder.

11
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,595
today ship wheels connect to the rudder         

12
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,864
through a mechanical or hydraulic system.      

13
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,267
found mostly in yachts up to 200 feet long,      

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,271
they're a luxurious way to echo
the glory days of the sea.   

15
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,410
this company makes yacht wheels
as large as 5 feet in diameter.

16
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,014
it uses two traditional shipbuilding woods --     

17
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,215
american holly and burmese teak,

18
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,019
species that are as beautiful as they are durable.      

19
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,754
workers use a table saw    

20
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,491
to cut both types of wood into long, thin strips     

21
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,627
that will become the wheel's rim.        

22
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,297
they measure the strips with digital calipers,     

23
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,299
then sand them down to a thickness         

24
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,267
of just 1/8 of an inch.    

25
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,839
using a disk sander now,    

26
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,442
a worker angles the ends into what are called scarf joints. 

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:55,013
he'll join the strips by fitting
these angles together.     

28
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,119
after coating each strip with epoxy,          

29
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,888
he attaches it with clamps to a round jig,        

30
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,158
waxed beforehand to prevent sticking.      

31
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,329
the glue is waterproof     

32
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,264
because the wheels are often exposed        

33
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,133
to rough weather up on deck.  

34
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:20,072
the worker gradually bends each 6 1/2-foot-long strip   

35
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,873
all the way around the jig.  

36
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,208
and a spring-loaded clamp   

37
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,878
temporarily holds the end of each strip in place 

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,014
until he aligns the scarf joint
with that of the next strip.  

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,285
it takes up to eight hours of nonstop work        

40
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,987
to lay all the strips.     

41
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:42,627
he alternates between the blond holly and the darker teak

42
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,829
for a total of seven layers.  

43
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,899
then he leaves the rim to set overnight.       

44
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,702
to make each spoke -- the wheel has five of them -- 

45
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,906
a worker temporarily joins strips of holly and teak 

46
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:57,509
with double-sided tape.    

47
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,045
a computer-guided cutting machine then carves  

48
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,047
an opening through the middle 

49
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,118
and shapes the outer edge into a triangular shape.    

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,986
this reduces the spoke's weight

51
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,389
and helps it fit to the rim later on.           

52
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,193
next he removes the tape and glues the wood strips together,

53
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,862
along with others made of carbon fiber.     

54
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,333
they strengthen the spoke while keeping it lightweight. 

55
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,006
he places a waxed jig in the center and clamps in place.

56
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,345
he leaves the spoke to set overnight.       

57
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,948
the next day, he sands away the dried glue, 

58
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,151
then uses a router to round the edges.      

59
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,754
together, the four wood and three carbon-fiber layers 

60
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,390
are just one inch thick.    

61
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,964
he traces a template      

62
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:56,768
on a stack of 14 pre-glued,  
curved strips of holly and teak.

63
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,304
he follows his trace lines with a band saw,        

64
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,974
cutting out what's called a fairing.           

65
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:06,278
this component will join each spoke to the rim.     

66
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,317
now he drills a hole in each fairing...       

67
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,726
...and inserts a temporary dowel

68
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,162
to position a reinforcing strip
of carbon fiber at the top.  

69
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,867
it's time to join the spokes to the rim.     

70
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,736
earlier, he glued strong fiberglass dowels to the rim. 

71
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,273
now he inserts them into the fairings       

72
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,743
and into holes in the spokes, also glued beforehand.     

73
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:44,349
through the openings,     
he clamps the spokes to the rim.

74
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,486
then he positions an aluminum hub in the center, 

75
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,022
tapping it into place with a mallet.         

76
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,158
now, with a jigsaw,      

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,561
he cuts a sliver off the ends of the fairings  

78
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,130
so they'll curve into the rim. 

79
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,969
he uses a router to round off 
the vertical edges of the wheel.

80
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,037
he files the fairings by hand 

81
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,907
to complete the smooth transition to the rim.     

82
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,842
just these finishing touches alone    

83
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,912
can take up to five hours to complete.          

84
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,983
using a router, it takes him another five hours

85
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,319
to gradually round off the horizontal edge.      

86
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,255
now to protect the wheel from the elements --      

87
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,324
particularly sun damage.    

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,193
first, a polyester primer.   

89
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,397
then they sand it and apply  
two coats of waterproof varnish.

90
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,132
on the yacht,         

91
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,135
five stainless-steel bolts attach the wheel to a pedestal 

92
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,004
that connects to the rest of the steering mechanism.   

93
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,073
to change how fast the rudder moves,   

94
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,742
you simply turn a knob at the center of the wheel.  

95
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,811
how's that for power steering? 

96
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,849
a relatively high-tech way to navigate the open seas.   

97
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,293
narrator: new england settlers in the 1700s          

98
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,028
were the first         
to braid strips of used clothing

99
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,630
and then sew them into rugs.  

100
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,900
today high-speed machines create
this classic look       

101
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,702
in a fraction of the time,   

102
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,038
but with synthetic as well as natural fabric and yarns  

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,608
so the rugs last even longer. 

104
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,848
this company's most popular rugs
are oval or rectangular,    

105
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,385
some small enough for your stairs.        

106
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,790
the rugs begin as yarn.    

107
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:36,094
they wind the yarn onto bobbins 
that fit the factory's machines.

108
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,734
the yarn ranges from pure wool 

109
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,869
to a blend of wool and polypropylene        

110
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,739
that makes the rug durable even outdoors.         

111
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,209
this machine braids yarn    

112
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,346
from 24 bobbins around a core of synthetic fabric.  

113
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,615
the result is a complicated weave called cable lock.    

114
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,218
other rugs have just three braided segments,  

115
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
in what's called a flat braid. 

116
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,158
here a worker uses a powerful sewing machine   

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,228
to join flat braids with sturdy nylon thread.   

118
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,897
this makes one enormous piece 

119
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,099
the length of half a tennis court.    

120
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,639
the piece moves along a conveyer

121
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,708
to an automated rotary saw that cuts it to size.     

122
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,443
the saw passes twice      

123
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,280
to ensure a clean cut through the one-inch thickness.

124
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,521
another industrial sewing machine attaches binding tape 

125
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,789
to seal the edge.       

126
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,326
this prevents rectangular   
and square rugs from unraveling.

127
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,328
oval and round rugs don't need this        

128
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,996
because their braids aren't cut.

129
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,536
this machine does what's called serging.     

130
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,338
it sews yarn over the binding tape to cover it, 

131
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,641
a purely aesthetic gesture.  

132
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,954
to make fabric rugs,      

133
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,958
a seamstress joins several pieces of different fabric   

134
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,226
along one edge.        

135
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,962
they're a cotton-and-polyester blend that's durable      

136
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,630
and easy to wash.       

137
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:23,168
the more patterns, the more complex the rug will look.   

138
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,704
after they wind the fabric into a roll,          

139
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,240
a rotary saw cuts the roll   

140
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,642
to make strips that are one inch wide.    

141
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,250
the fabric strip then unwinds 

142
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,518
into a machine that folds it over filler.   

143
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,653
this forms the core of the fabric tubes      

144
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,322
they call spaghetti.      

145
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,127
the machine wraps the fabric around the filler,       

146
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,797
then sews the edges into a closed tube.      

147
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,145
rollers guide the spaghetti out of the machine       

148
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,214
and onto bobbins.       

149
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,088
this machine weaves spaghetti from three bobbins       

150
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,890
into a flat braid.       

151
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,026
fabric rugs are made only as flat braids  

152
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,161
because the material is too thick          

153
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,698
to weave into a cable lock.  

154
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,233
the braids settle into barrels for storage          

155
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,903
until they're woven into rugs. 

156
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,177
sometimes mats are assembled from a variety of braids    

157
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,680
for a different look.     

158
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,653
to make an oval or round rug, 

159
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,857
a worker coils one continuous braid around itself.

160
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:56,761
at the same time,       
she sews each braid to the next.

161
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:06,270
these rugs can have anywhere from 16 to 320 rows. 

162
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,209
this factory uses tables with holes that blow pressurized air

163
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,013
to float rugs like this one as they grow heavier.     

164
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,547
the ovals range in size.    

165
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,683
they can be as small as a doormat          

166
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,252
and as large as a swimming pool.

167
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,226
but when the rugs get really big,        

168
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,629
some extra help may be required.

169
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,365
it takes her about two hours  

170
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,970
to sew together one of these huge rugs.    

171
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,973
lastly, the worker staples a tag to the rug    

172
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,908
that reveals the style and size

173
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,512
before the rug heads off to shipping.     

174
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,981
perhaps more than any other floor covering, 

175
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,850
these rugs don't just lie there.

176
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,785
the variety of styles and shapes

177
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,721
means they really tell a story at your feet.         

178
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,397
narrator: only about 2 inches in diameter,          

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,934
a car's thermostat sits between
the engine and the radiator.  

180
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,402
until the engine warms up,   

181
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,072
it blocks the flow of coolant to the radiator.        

182
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,941
when the engine reaches about 200 degrees fahrenheit, 

183
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,409
the thermostat opens,     

184
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,479
letting coolant flow through  
the radiator and into the engine

185
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,481
to prevent overheating.    

186
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,687
the key component inside the thermostat is wax. 

187
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,555
when the engine heats up,   

188
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,891
the wax melts and the thermostat opens,   

189
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,959
triggering the cooling system. 

190
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,762
the wax melts quickly     

191
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,297
because it contains powdered copper, graphite,   

192
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,367
and/or aluminum.        

193
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,505
as the wax transforms from solid
to liquid, it expands.     

194
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,175
the pressure pushes a pin that opens the valve      

195
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:54,112
that enables the flow of coolant
to the engine.         

196
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,581
after heating and mixing in the powders,   

197
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,517
workers pour the wax into slab-shaped molds.    

198
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,391
it takes about a half-hour to cool and solidify.     

199
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,527
then they extract the slabs and grind them up.       

200
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,134
they feed the granulated wax to a pill-making machine,   

201
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,136
the kind pharmaceutical factories use. 

202
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,512
it compress the granules into cylindrical pellets.   

203
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,218
meanwhile, workers feed a copper strip  

204
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,688
into a machine called a high-speed transfer press.  

205
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,824
its successive stations    

206
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:43,394
shape the copper cup that will house the wax pellet.

207
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,900
the first station stamps out a circle.      

208
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:53,037
the others progressively stretch
and form the circle into a cup. 

209
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,047
the cups go into an automated assembly machine, 

210
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,986
which drops a pellet into each one.         

211
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:12,724
a pin then bores a hole down the center of each wax pellet. 

212
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:16,594
the machine inserts a rubber sleeve into the pellet hole   

213
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,665
and caps the sleeve with a brass cover.      

214
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,272
then it crimps the cup over the cover,        

215
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,274
forming a seal that's leak-resistant.     

216
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,678
now the machine inserts the stainless-steel pin    

217
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,747
that opens and closes the coolant valve.       

218
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,149
the pin goes right into the rubber sleeve  

219
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,586
in the center of the wax pellet.

220
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,492
how do all these parts work together?         

221
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,961
the melting wax expands within the cup,        

222
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,230
squeezing the rubber sleeve.  

223
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,767
that forces the pin upward, opening the coolant valve.   

224
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,368
now they heat the parts    

225
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,505
to the temperature at which the
engine coolant should kick in. 

226
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,807
a calibration machine squeezes the cup        

227
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,144
until the pin rises enough to open the coolant valve.   

228
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,651
the components now enter a machine      

229
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,353
which connects that valve.   

230
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,395
the valve is made up of two stainless-steel pieces. 

231
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,598
the machine loads one on top of the other,    

232
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,401
over the thin end of the cup...

233
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,137
then pushes the valve over the end of the cup,    

234
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,373
attaching it to the wide end. 

235
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,349
on the left is before the valve installation,    

236
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,652
and here's after.       

237
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,624
meanwhile, a press forms the top part of the thermostat,

238
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,226
called the flange.       

239
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,829
it's made of stainless steel coated with a lubricant.    

240
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,030
as with the cup,        

241
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,400
a series of dies progressively forms the flange.

242
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,971
now for the final assembly.  

243
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,841
first, the thermostat's stainless-steel frame.     

244
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,776
next, a stainless-steel spring.

245
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,813
its job is to close the valve when the engine cools.     

246
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:23,521
now the assembled components go inside the spring.     

247
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,424
the flange goes on top.    

248
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,463
a tool called an orbital riveter
flattens a tab         

249
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,098
on either side of the flange. 

250
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,268
this holds the frame onto the flange.        

251
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,005
the assembly machine now crimps 
two little tabs against the pin,

252
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,741
keeping it from falling out of the rubber sleeve.     

253
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,377
and with that, the thermostat is finished.  

254
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,018
this demonstration shows how, as the engine heats up,    

255
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
the melting wax pushes the pin upward,     

256
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,289
and when the engine cools, the opposite happens      

257
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,091
so that even though you might boil over in heavy traffic,  

258
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,560
your engine doesn't have to.  

259
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,902
narrator: a chisel is a metal tool with a sharp end 

260
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,639
for shaping stone, metal, or wood.            

261
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,376
you use your hand, a hammer, or 
a mallet to drive it in and cut.

262
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,844
although chisels date back to ancient asia,   

263
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,181
today's factories use heat-treated steel     

264
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,751
and high-tech machines to make them stay sharper longer. 

265
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,792
a wood chisel needs to be very sharp,    

266
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,328
especially for intricate carving.     

267
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,663
making chisels starts when they insert        

268
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,066
a 16 1/2-foot-long bar of high-carbon steel      

269
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,401
in a mechanical press.     

270
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:46,137
the carbon lets them heat-treat
the steel           

271
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,206
to give it a long-lasting edge.

272
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:53,378
but first the press cuts the bar
into 8 1/2-inch-long rods.   

273
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,818
the rods then go through an induction heater.      

274
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,754
in just six seconds, a magnetic field heats them  

275
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,290
to about 2,300 degrees fahrenheit,          

276
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,860
a temperature at which the steel can be forged.    

277
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,633
a worker sets each hot rod into a die in a forging press. 

278
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,370
the die slams down, applying 700 tons of pressure. 

279
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,175
this produces what's called a forging, a rough shaping.  

280
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,446
the die can produce as many as 60,000 forgings   

281
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,148
before it wears out.      

282
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,519
each one goes into what's called a trimming press.

283
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,189
here a die cuts out      
the precise shape of the chisel,

284
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,993
with the blade on one end and the tang on the other.   

285
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:46,730
the tang later fits into a plastic or wooden handle

286
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,799
so you can comfortably grip the tool.           

287
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,437
the factory sends the excess metal out for recycling.    

288
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,614
after the chisels cool off for several hours,       

289
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,917
workers run them through another
induction-heating machine,   

290
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,253
this one with two coils.    

291
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,628
the first heats them to 1,400 degrees fahrenheit.  

292
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,298
then warm water cools them down.

293
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,301
this rapid reduction in    
temperature is called quenching.

294
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,703
it's what hardens the chisels enough to be strong      

295
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,571
and stay sharp.        

296
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,241
the next coil heats them    
to about 700 degrees fahrenheit.

297
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,910
this step is called tempering. 

298
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,312
it relieves the stresses    

299
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:38,783
that the quenching phase created inside the metal.   

300
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,988
spring-loaded clamps now release
the chisels from the machine, 

301
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,225
and they drop into a container to cool overnight.       

302
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,462
the next day,         

303
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,199
workers can start to polish and sharpen the chisels.    

304
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,468
that removes the metal discoloration    

305
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,470
the heat-treating caused.   

306
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,206
to polish the barrels,     

307
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,809
the round areas joining the blade and the tang,    

308
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,679
workers load the chisels into devices called chucks.  

309
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,281
these clamp the chisels securely by the blade     

310
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,952
as the barrels spin against a rough-grit sanding wheel.  

311
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,888
after about seven seconds of sanding,   

312
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,291
the blades are ready for polishing.         

313
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:30,301
a powerful magnet locks them in place on a round table.   

314
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,902
it rotates,          

315
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,106
running the blades against an abrasive grinding wheel.  

316
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,707
as water cools the metal,   

317
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,511
it also applies a rust-proofing
chemical to the steel.     

318
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,814
this polishing cycle takes about 20 seconds.    

319
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,787
the highly polished finish is a key selling point.    

320
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,124
now to sharpen the blades.   

321
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,060
a worker loads the chisels into another machine.     

322
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,063
it moves the chisels back and forth         

323
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,732
against another grinding wheel.

324
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:05,403
after about five minutes of this,            

325
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,638
the blades are razor-sharp.  

326
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,876
only the last 1/2 inch of the chisel,         

327
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,348
sloping at a 22-degree angle, is the cutting edge.      

328
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,285
this factory uses preformed extruded-plastic handles    

329
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,087
for its chisels.        

330
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,423
a hot metal die with raised lettering     

331
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,826
presses and melts a colored  
plastic ribbon into each handle.

332
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,895
this imprints the company logo,
the model size,        

333
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,532
and a reminder to wear safety goggles.    

334
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,503
the next machine puts a steel cap on top    

335
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,039
and forces the tang inside the hole.        

336
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,109
the cap reinforces the handle against hammer blows.     

337
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:48,646
the tang stays put because it's actually a bit bigger   

338
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,582
than the hole it goes into -- 

339
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,085
in industry lingo, an interference fit.      

340
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,727
the finished tools come off the line.       

341
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:06,364
now you can chisel your crafts for years to come.
