narrator: when the pressure is on,    

4
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,588
the juices start flowing for quick results.       

5
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,657
the pressure cooker traps steam inside       

6
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,394
to raise the cooking temperature
and produce a meal in minutes. 

7
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,197
the technology has been around for centuries         

8
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,200
but was only adapted for household use in the 1930s,

9
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,670
when the concept really picked up steam.    

10
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,743
modern pressure cookers have new lid-locking technology   

11
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,011
and safety features,      

12
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,612
keeping it on the front burner 

13
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,848
in the kitchen-gadget department.          

14
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:30,222
a pressure cooker starts with a stainless-steel disk.  

15
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,959
a dip of some lubricant will aid the forming process, 

16
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,663
as equipment pushes the disk over a pot-shaped die.     

17
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,041
that flat disk is now a nicely rounded pot.     

18
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,648
next, this punch cutter moves in

19
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,085
to make notches in the pot's rim.       

20
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,724
these notches will interlock with the pressure-cooker lid, 

21
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:07,760
allowing it to hold up tight against steam pressure.    

22
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,000
next, they submerge aluminum disks  

23
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,069
in a liquid mix of aluminum and silicon    

24
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,538
to give them an even coating. 

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,740
while the disk is still damp, 

26
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,543
they arrange it on the bottom of the pot,   

27
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,346
then set a stainless-steel disk
on top of it.         

28
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,017
a turntable delivers the pot to an element         

29
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,087
that's heated to more than 1,100 degrees fahrenheit.    

30
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,355
this intense heat       

31
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,091
activates the aluminum and silicon solution      

32
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,061
to fuse the disk to the bottom of the pot.   

33
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,969
then it's into a cooling tank, 

34
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,071
where the pots float towards the next station.   

35
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,579
there, two blades shave away the ragged edges  

36
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,182
of the fused layers on the bottom of the pot.   

37
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:07,586
it creates a cosmetic beveled effect.   

38
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,391
that layer of aluminum sandwiched between the steel  

39
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,895
will improve the pot's heat conductivity.  

40
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,799
and now it's time for some grit and polish.   

41
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,334
in this special chamber,    

42
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,471
sanding and buffing tools add luster to the pots.    

43
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,477
the pressure-cooker pot    

44
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,079
then takes a trip through a washing station   

45
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,115
to clean off the sanding residue.      

46
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,020
and now it's ready for the crowning touch --   

47
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,355
the lid.            

48
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:46,826
it takes six pressing operations
to shape it completely.    

49
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,360
the holes at the center    

50
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,696
are for the pressure cooker's two safety valves.       

51
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,766
to install the main valve,   

52
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,369
they align a retaining ring with the lid's larger hole,  

53
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,172
then pop the spring valve into that hole.        

54
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:05,443
an automated device underneath tightly screws it into place.  

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,981
the backup valve goes in the smaller hole.   

56
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,517
these two valves are crucial. 

57
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,320
they'll release excess steam to avert an explosion.     

58
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:17,856
a rubber ring creates an airtight seal with the pot. 

59
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,993
they test the valves and check the sealing ring,  

60
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,430
along with the lid's closing mechanism.       

61
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:31,937
this plastic cooking guide   
encircles the main safety valve,

62
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,674
but doesn't impede its function.

63
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:40,012
they weld several bolts into the pot on either side.  

64
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,484
they leave a bit of space   

65
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,220
between the bolt heads and the pot.          

66
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,957
this allows them to install the brackets for the handles. 

67
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,030
they torque the bolts     

68
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,966
to tightly secure the bracketed handles.     

69
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,569
after all, a pressure cooker is one thing 

70
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,571
you don't want to lose your grip on.         

71
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:14,513
and now this pressure cooker is in the homestretch.     

72
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,515
there's one last test,     

73
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:20,920
which they perform on randomly selected pots.   

74
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:25,390
they pump the pot full of air to simulate the effect of steam

75
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,928
and confirm that this pot can handle the pressure.    

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,665
pressure cookers with double walls are another innovation. 

77
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,735
they'll keep that stew warm longer     

78
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,738
to ease the pressure on the chef.

the swiss-made novelty

soon became the rage among classy europeans.

a few decades later,      

84
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,902
a french watchmaker perfected the sound mechanism, 

85
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,571
making the birdsong virtually indiscernible    

86

from the real thing.

making these singing automatons.

90
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,520
the workshop crafts large ones that go in birdcages

[ chirping ]          

93
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,595
the first step is to adjust  

94
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,465
the bird's two spring-loaded steel rods.   

95
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:44,069
one pivots the bird's head   
and the other its beak and tail.

96
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,139
then it's time to dress the bird's body.        

97
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,942
it's illegal to harvest real bird feathers,      

98
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,479
so the artist uses real antique feathers     

99
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,147
in a couple of key spots

to craft the tail,       

102
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,956
she glues feathers onto stiff paper,        

103
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,127
then folds it over and adheres it to the bird.  

104
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,598
then she adds more feathers,  

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,568
meticulously creating colorful layers.        

106
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,272
the plumage alone takes about four hours' work.

they screw the windup key   

110
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,523
to the mechanical movement that animates the birds.    

111
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:43,128
the movement is made up of 250 brass and steel components

assembled manually.      

113

they connect leather bellows. 

114
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,066
the movement pumps the bellows,

115
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,469
which sends air through a tiny whistle,

over a curved form.      

138
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,357
first, they slide on two brass rings        

139
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,227
and position a brass disk at the top.          

140
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,896
then, they feed thick brass wire        

141
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,799
through holes in the rings.  

142
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,237
they lock each wire onto the disk temporarily,   

143

00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,959
bonding the outer and inner rings.   

155
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,964
every mechanical singing bird this company produces     

156
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,300
is a work of artistic and technical craftsmanship  

157
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,903
that delivers a performance on command.          

158
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,339
[ chirping ]          

159
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,860
narrator: oceanographic buoys enable scientists to study the sea,  

160
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,263
help meteorologists predict weather,        

161
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:07,132
and rescue teams better define a search area.  

162
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,935
the top part of the buoy houses instrumentation     

163
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:12,403
that tracks temperature, surface currents,       

164
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,805
and other conditions.     

165
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:17,309
its antenna transmits the data 
via satellite to a base station.

166
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,948
this model has a ball-shaped surface float  

167
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,349
with a tether cable      

168
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,285
connecting a long fabric tube called a drogue.        

169
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,754
the drogue detects water movements    

170
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,957
several yards below the surface.

171
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,294
the component that connects the surface float to the cable 

172
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,095
is called the stress relief.  

173
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,965
the factory makes this part in a mold,           

174
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,833
casting 10 at a time.     

175
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:46,104
workers inject liquid urethane into the mold cavities.    

176
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,706
it's the same material     

177
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,708
from which in-line skate wheels are made. 

178
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,046
after three hours,       

179
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,618
they extract the castings,   
which then cure for a full week.

180
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,390
the surface float contains a barometer sensor  

181
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,192
that collects air-pressure data,

182
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,863
as well as a temperature sensor
and a locating system.     

183
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:16,935
a 13.5-volt battery pack powers all these instruments. 

184
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,203
workers build it        

185
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,339
by arranging 36 standard d-cell batteries.       

186
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,543
using nickel strips, they make pairs,        

187
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:28,880
linking the negative end to a positive end.       

188
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,551
then, they spot-weld the strips,
creating circuit pathways   

189
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:35,020
along which electricity will flow.     

190
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,963
next, they immobilize the batteries 

191
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,300
by filling the spaces between them with hot glue.  

192
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,105
then, they weld the final connections     

193
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,574
and solder on the leads    

194
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:59,344
that will connect the battery pack to the instrumentation.  

195
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,317
now they apply special insulating paper    

196
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,919
to prevent the battery pack from shorting,         

197
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,122
should it come into contact with a metal object.      

198
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,325
a wide band of electrical tape 

199
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:16,261
safely seals this 13-pound battery pack.  

200
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,342
the nylon/polypropylene drogue 

201
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,011
is too lightweight       
to hang vertically in the water,

202
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,480
so it needs something to weigh it down.       

203
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,783
that something is a heavy, plastic hoop.   

204
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,556
they make the hoop by blowing 
sand into a plastic garden hose.

205
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,325
the sand makes it heavy.    

206
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,634
after capping the hose,    

207
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:59,637
they insert it in a pocket at the bottom of the drogue.  

208
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,574
so now the drogue, all 26 feet of it,       

209
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,811
will dangle straight down into the water.        

210
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,854
now for that stress relief they molded earlier on.    

211
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,856
it attaches underneath the bottom half   

212
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,059
of the surface float.     

213
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,997
inside the bottom half,    
they install the battery pack...

214
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,200
then a control board...    

215
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,067
a transmitter...        

216
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,837
and an antenna.        

217
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,944
the surface float is made of a.b.s. plastic,   

218
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,481
the top surface coated for u.v. protection      

219
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:46,083
because it will be exposed to direct sunlight.      

220
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,287
they attach one end of the tether cable      

221
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,956
to the stress relief      

222
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,325
and the other end to the drogue.

223
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,467
they reinforce the connection with epoxy.          

224
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,237
this type of buoy       

225
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,039
is designed to monitor only the top yard of water,  

226
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,508
so it doesn't have a long vertical drogue     

227
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,709
like the other one.      

228
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,778
what it<i> does</i> have is a parachute,        

229
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,448
because it's designed to be dropped by aircraft   

230
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,516
in a search-and-rescue operation,           

231
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,086
to mark the location of an incident.        

232
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,460
as the demonstration shows, the buoy opens on impact.   

233
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,397
all the components are spring-loaded --      

234
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,965
floats made of foam,      

235
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,801
drogues around the central cylinder      

236
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,870
housing the instrumentation,  

237
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,138
and on top an antenna.     

238
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,209
the buoy packaging is     
water-soluble and biodegradable,

239
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,277
so, over time, it simply disintegrates.    

240
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,647
no need to retrieve them.   

241
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,596
narrator: stainless-steel tank trailers carry all kinds of products,  

242
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,798
from milk, sugar, and animal feed        

243
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,033
to fertilizer, shampoo, or even wine.         

244
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,270
some tank trailers only haul chemicals like methanol.    

245
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,739
made of stainless steel inside and out,        

246
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,876
they keep all the products they're transporting      

247
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,010
contaminant-free.       

248
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,884
stainless-steel tank trailers 

249
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:29,687
carry as much as 12,000 gallons of product. 

250
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,557
they start with a laser cutting machine  

251
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,560
which cuts pieces like this manhole opening   

252
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:39,297
from the stainless-steel sheet used to make the tank.     

253
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,368
the laser that cuts the steel is as precise         

254
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,271
as the pen you use to sign your name.       

255
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,711
next, they make the larger pieces of the tank 

256
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,914
by putting two sheets of stainless steel       

257
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,185
into a machine called a plasma seam welder.     

258
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,789
using stainless-steel wire as a filler metal,       

259
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,525
the computer-controlled machine

260
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,860
welds the two sheets of steel together.       

261
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,801
a worker then uses a belt sander
that rides on a track     

262
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:20,405
to smooth out the weld evenly and in a straight line. 

263
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,613
the sheet then goes through a rolling machine       

264
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,615
that shapes it into a cylinder.

265
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,685
it takes two to four cylinders to make a tank,        

266
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,353
depending on the size.     

267
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,157
meanwhile, a ring-rolling machine     

268
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,160
makes what's called channel rings         

269
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,028
that will strengthen the cylinders         

270
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,364
and help them keep their round shape.    

271
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,966
the rings are also made    

272
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,835
of corrosion-resistant stainless steel.        

273
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,406
some tanks need up to 12 of these reinforcement rings. 

274
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,717
a worker then welds      
the channel rings onto the tank,

275
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,087
stopping periodically to inspect the weld.      

276
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,262
next, they weld tank heads to the cylinder.        

277
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,930
welding parts on the outside of the tank   

278
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,334
causes heat discoloration to the steel on the inside.  

279
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,737
that's why a worker then polishes the stainless steel, 

280
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,140
giving the full interior of the tank          

281
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,943
a noticeably clean and bright finish.       

282
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,753
then, they attach polyurethane spacer bands to the tank.   

283
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,360
these create the sections they need           

284
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:51,696
to mount fiberglass insulation around the tank,        

285
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,399
which keeps the product either warm or cold.      

286
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,970
workers then install thin sections of stainless steel  

287
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,308
around the tank to protect the insulation.   

288
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,411
this steel is shiny for cosmetic reasons only.   

289
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,517
they hold the sections in place temporarily      

290
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,452
using leather belts.      

291
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:18,723
they secure this entire outer wrapper so it fits properly.  

292
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,793
then, they weld each section of steel     

293
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,662
to the frame of the tank.   

294
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,533
next, they prepare the outer wrapper heads    

295
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,602
using what's called a lock-seam flanger.      

296
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,673
that makes a lip in the edge of the heads.   

297
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,542
they attach the front and rear heads    

298
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,077
to the outer wrapper      

299
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,814
by fitting the lip into    
the outer wrapper's grooved edge

300
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,350
and crimping them together using a hammer.        

301
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,428
next, they install the aluminum
fenders over the rear tires.  

302
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,635
after that, they attach a stainless-steel tube ladder 

303
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:06,504
that gives access to the manhole
at the top of the tank,    

304
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,940
where they load the product.  

305
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,645
they put the mudguards on next,

306
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,448
followed by the reflective conspicuity tape        

307
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,916
that goes on both sides of the tank          

308
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,352
and on the two rear bumpers.  

309
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,126
they install the stoplights and taillights         

310
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,695
into a light box at the rear of the trailer.  

311
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,668
after that, they install the turn indicators      

312
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,537
on the sides of the trailer  

313
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,140
and test them to ensure they function properly.    

314
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,410
finally, they check all the connections      

315
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,612
used to operate the tank trailer,       

316
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,347
so when it leaves the plant, it works perfectly       

317
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,852
and the customer can transport their product safely.     

318
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:04,361
if you have any questions about the show,        

319
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,298
