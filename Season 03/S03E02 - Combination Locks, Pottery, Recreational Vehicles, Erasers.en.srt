00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,057
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,128
...combination locks...

3
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,233
...pottery...

4
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,072
...recreational vehicles...

5
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,477
...and erasers.

6
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:56,588
combination padlocks are what students depend on

7
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,926
to protect their lockers from thieves and pranksters.

8
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,663
combo locks are functional yet fashionable.

9
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,800
like everything else marketed to teenagers these days,

10
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:11,637
they come in a variety of trendy colors and designs.

11
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,677
the combination lock's main locking mechanism

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,879
is called the baseplate,

13
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,316
and it's comprised of seven components.

14
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,226
that black piece, called the lock bolt,

15
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,761
is what slides open to free the shackle

16
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,331
when someone dials the correct combination.

17
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,169
they rivet the baseplate components into place

18
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,373
so the lock will stand up to repeated use.

19
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,711
here are those components before assembly and after.

20
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,848
they secure the assembled baseplate into the casing.

21
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,518
then they install the trip-lever spring.

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,121
it's what automatically scrambles the mechanism

23
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,524
every time the lock is closed.

24
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:09,261
they fit the shackle through holes in the casing,

25
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,330
positioning one end against the trip lever.

26
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,532
they fasten the other side

27
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,870
with a tiny steel bar called a yoke.

28
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,805
the lock's combination function

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,409
is made up of three stacked disks called tumblers.

30
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,079
here, the first two go in.

31
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,147
next, they grease the shackle

32
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,583
so it will slide in and out easily.

33
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,562
sometimes they customize the face of the lock.

34
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,564
those numbered dials used to come

35
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,966
in just boring standard-issue steel.

36
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,435
today, they can have colorful designs --

37
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,004
even a school's logo.

38
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:59,845
the printing machine uses a four-color printing process,

39
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,247
applying one color at a time.

40
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,858
the painted dials get two coats
of clear varnish

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,861
to harden and protect the paint.

42
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,268
while that's happening,

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,071
other workers assemble the dial components.

44
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:29,541
first they take the indicator button

45
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,643
and attach it to the dial.

46
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,551
then they take the third tumbler

47
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,221
and rivet it to the back of the dial.

48
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,088
this tumbler will control

49
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,424
the movement of the two other tumblers

50
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,760
inside the lock's casing.

51
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,497
all three tumblers have "v"-shaped indentations.

52
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,166
the correct combination aligns those v's,

53
00:03:55,168 --> 00:04:00,706
allowing the lock bolt to slide
over and free of the shackle.

54
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,776
each tumbler has a code number stamped on the back.

55
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:10,081
the number corresponds to the location of its indentation.

56
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,250
they program each lock's three tumbler codes

57
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,720
into a computer.

58
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,456
the computer then randomly creates a combination

59
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,859
that will align the three indentations.

60
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,664
there are more than 50,000 possible combinations.

61
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,940
the system prints the combination on a sticker

62
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,743
along with a bar code.

63
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,879
the bar code is programmed into a central computer,

64
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,749
where it's recorded with the lock's serial number.

65
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,485
the guts of the combination lock
are finished.

66
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,421
now it's time for the final assembling.

67
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,091
they put the dial onto the casing.

68
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,628
then a forming tool presses down
on the casing's rim,

69
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,864
folding it tightly over the dial.

70
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,104
a computer-guided machine

71
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:10,142
then engraves a serial number on each lock.

72
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,049
some factories do random quality-control checks,

73
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,851
but this company verifies

74
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,854
each and every combination lock
by hand.

75
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,722
that's quite the procedure,

76
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:29,327
considering this plant produces
more than 10,000 locks a day.

77
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,797
you can bet somebody's got pretty sore fingers

78
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,665
by quitting time.

79
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,016
narrator: as early as 11,000 b.c.,

80
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,085
man was making utensils out of clay.

81
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,421
this was the birth of pottery.

82
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:00,092
modern pottery is divided into three categories --

83
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,427
porcelain, stoneware, and earthenware.

84
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,295
what differentiates them

85
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,599
is the mixture of clays and the firing process.

86
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,772
this earthenware piece starts with a technical drawing

87
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,442
based on an artist's conception.

88
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,977
following the specs,

89
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,846
they use a series of specialized tools

90
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,784
to sculpt a plaster model on an electric potter's wheel.

91
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,157
they check the diameter with calipers.

92
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,594
the model is 7% larger than the finished piece will be

93
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,529
to compensate for shrinkage

94
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:40,365
that will occur during drying and firing.

95
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:54,613
they sculpt some parts by hand and glue them on.

96
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,687
using this model, they cast a master mold,

97
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,958
made out of a rigid type of plaster called gypsum.

98
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,027
they now use this master mold to cast a production mold

99
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,931
out of rubber or, in this case, plaster.

100
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,902
first they pour in the plaster,

101
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,237
using their hands to break up any air bubbles

102
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,440
that would cause defects in the casting.

103
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,320
the leave it to air-dry in a warm room overnight.

104
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,656
once it's ready, they can extract it --

105
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,126
a delicate operation that takes 15 minutes.

106
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,730
this production mold has to cure
for 48 hours

107
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,599
before going into service.

108
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,069
it will be good for 200 castings.

109
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,806
and it will be identified by the model number on its side.

110
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,675
earthenware is made of talc,

111
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,278
a mineral called nepheline syenite,

112
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,081
a dark-beige clay known as ball clay,

113
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,016
another mineral called silicon,

114
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,085
and a white clay known as kaolin,

115
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,822
all mixed with 40% water.

116
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,225
they pour the mix into the production mold

117
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,694
with careful, even pressure,

118
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,631
again to avoid creating air bubbles.

119
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,366
the plaster mold slowly absorbs the water,

120
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,103
leaving behind a moist earthenware lining

121
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,505
2/10 of an inch thick.

122
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,708
after about a half-hour, this lining hardens,

123
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,311
and they can dump out the surplus liquid.

124
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,220
they cut off the excess earthenware at the top...

125
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,264
...then, after another 45 minutes or so,

126
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,801
extract the piece from the mold.

127
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,337
workers have to handle the earthenware gingerly

128
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,406
with even pressure.

129
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,342
if one finger presses just a bit too hard,

130
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,278
it will show up as a dent,

131
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,414
but only after the piece is fired.

132
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,151
after a 24-hour drying period,

133
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,354
workers then carefully shave off
the seam

134
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,757
left by the two halves of the mold.

135
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,759
they rub the piece on a wet stone

136
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,296
to even out the top and bottom.

137
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,599
then they smooth the surface with a wet sponge.

138
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,707
unlike stoneware,

139
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,776
which comes out glossy after firing,

140
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,179
earthenware remains dull.

141
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,581
so, to make it shiny and colorful,

142
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,218
they apply specialized glazes and enamel paints.

143
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,806
finally, they spray the piece from top to bottom

144
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,674
in a transparent glaze

145
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,609
to give it an overall sheen.

146
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,879
then it's off to a room-sized oven called a kiln

147
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,815
for an eight-hour firing,

148
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,283
during which time the temperature climbs

149
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,087
to more than 1,800 degrees fahrenheit.

150
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,824
then a two-hour cooldown.

151
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,760
the intense heat activates the pigments in the paints

152
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,696
and makes the colors come alive,

153
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,967
turning what was once a lump of clay into a work of art.

154
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,311
narrator: traveling in a recreational vehicle

155
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,247
is like having your own personal motel on wheels.

156
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,650
r.v.s are either motorized or towable.

157
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,121
towable ones range from folding-tent trailers,

158
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,722
known as pop ups,

159
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,724
to more elaborate travel trailers

160
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,495
complete with fully equipped bathrooms and kitchens.

161
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,800
to make a travel trailer,

162
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,669
workers first cut steel bars to build a frame.

163
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,605
the saw has to be drenched in coolant,

164
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,876
or it will overheat due to the intense friction.

165
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,479
they drill holes for the bolts and screws

166
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,149
they'll later use to attach certain components.

167
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,185
then they weld the frame parts together.

168
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,760
they run electrical wires through the frame,

169
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,362
lining the holes with rubber grommets

170
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,966
to keep the wires from rubbing on the sharp metal edge.

171
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,371
next they install metal brackets

172
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,773
to hold the water and septic tanks in place

173
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,775
underneath the trailer.

174
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,347
then they torque the wheels to the axle.

175
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,657
now they install the gas lines.

176
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,126
the stove, the fridge, and the heating system

177
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,895
all run on propane.

178
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,733
next come the water and septic tanks,

179
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,270
made of polyethylene, a heavy-duty plastic.

180
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:23,174
they cut a hole in each tank and screw on a fitting.

181
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,489
the tank sits directly on the frame.

182
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,891
the white one's for drinking water.

183
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,227
the first black one's for the shower and sinks,

184
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,265
and the second black one's for the toilet.

185
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,699
to build the floor,

186
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,701
they put down a waterproof membrane,

187
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,839
then a spruce frame insulated with fiberglass wool,

188
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,774
then 5/8 plywood,

189
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,444
cutting vent holes for the forced-air heating system.

190
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,114
after sanding the joints and gluing down linoleum,

191
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,817
they install the cabinetry and furniture.

192
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,790
the plumbing fixtures come next.

193
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,592
they connect to water lines

194
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,928
coming up from the tanks beneath the floor.

195
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,733
the water system is driven by an electric pump.

196
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,669
while some workers put up the preassembled walls,

197
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,039
others run wiring for lights and appliances.

198
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,351
the inside wall surface is vinyl paneling.

199
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:44,222
drywall would be far too heavy for an r.v.

200
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,691
the paneling's mounted on a pine structure

201
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,960
insulated with fiberglass wool.

202
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,973
they cover the outside in aluminum siding,

203
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,242
then they complete the electrical wiring

204
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,377
for the lights and appliances.

205
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,648
now it's time to install the roof --

206
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,918
another pine structure with fiberglass-wool insulation

207
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,520
covered with a thin wood called lauan

208
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,922
that's reinforced

209
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,659
to withstand the extra weight of roof cargo.

210
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,063
they cut out the various ventilation holes...

211
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,035
...then apply a layer of glue...

212
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,007
...then lay down

213
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,910
a high-performance waterproof rubber membrane...

214
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,115
...nailing it down along the perimeter.

215
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,486
they install vents for the toilet,

216
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:53,091
the refrigerator, and for air circulation.

217
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:58,429
they caulk all the joints and around all the vents.

218
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,831
last but not least --

219
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,701
the windows, doors, awnings, and any optional equipment.

220
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,838
workers check the water, gas, and electrical systems,

221
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,640
then do what's called a seal test.

222
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,643
a special machine applies air pressure

223
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,312
from the inside out.

224
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:18,116
wherever water bubbles, there's a leak to be repaired.

225
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,122
with all the upholstery

226
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,523
and other decorative elements in place,

227
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,795
this comfortable travel trailer
is ready to hit the road.

228
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,739
narrator: make no mistake about it --

229
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,475
an eraser is a student's best friend.

230
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,145
whether it's attached to the top
of a pencil or on its own,

231
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,882
only an eraser can quickly rub out an error.

232
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,686
white erasers are made of flexible vinyl,

233
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,723
while pink erasers are made of synthetic rubber.

234
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,232
in 1736, a french explorer

235
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,768
observed south american native indians

236
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,772
using a certain tree resin to make bouncing balls.

237
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:18,242
he brought this resin back home,
and before long,

238
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:22,246
europeans discovered it could rub out lead pencil marks,

239
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,581
hence the term "rubber."

240
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:29,854
there was just one problem -- after a while, rubber would rot.

241
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,590
that dilemma was solved a century later

242
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,591
by one charles goodyear,

243
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:38,763
who developed a curing process to keep rubber from rotting.

244
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:50,274
a lot of ingredients go into making a simple pink eraser --

245
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,410
carefully measured fillers, accelerators,

246
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,613
curing agents, oils, coloring,

247
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,750
and the main ingredient -- synthetic rubber.

248
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,620
they start by putting a batch of rubber into a mill.

249
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:06,524
the rubber passes repeatedly between large heated rollers.

250
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,230
they throw in any defective erasers

251
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,566
from the last production run,

252
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,904
recycling them into this new batch.

253
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,906
then they add sulfur as a curing agent,

254
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,976
accelerators to help the sulfur do its job,

255
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,179
and red coloring.

256
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,914
they blend everything for 5 to 10 minutes

257
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,118
until the mixture is the consistency of heavy dough.

258
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,255
next, vulcanized vegetable oil --

259
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,258
that's vegetable oil treated with sulfur.

260
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,460
then regular vegetable oil.

261
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,196
then calcium carbonate as a filler.

262
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,871
when the color and thickness are just right,

263
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,472
workers remove the rubber,

264
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:00,077
which, by now, is hot and soft as a result of all that milling.

265
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,546
they leave it to cool and harden
at room temperature

266
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,182
for about half a day.

267
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,290
when the rubber's ready, they cut out large squares,

268
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,893
each weighing between 11 and 18 pounds,

269
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,530
depending on the thickness of eraser the client has ordered.

270
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,106
the squares go into a steam-heated press to cure

271
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:34,778
for about 20 minutes at 325 degrees fahrenheit.

272
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
the pressure compacts the rubber,

273
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,317
while the intense heat hardens it.

274
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,589
they trim off the excess

275
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,393
then submerge the hot rubber squares in cold water

276
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,730
to stop the curing process.

277
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,133
to make erasers that erase both lead and ink,

278
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,136
they cut beveled strips from two batches of rubber,

279
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,572
one pink and one blue.

280
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,683
the blue contains pumice,

281
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:17,021
which gives it extra abrasiveness to erase ink.

282
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,157
they pair up each pink with a blue

283
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,292
to form a two-color strip.

284
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,832
then it's into the steam press.

285
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,508
after 12 minutes, workers remove the trays,

286
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,510
trim off the excess,

287
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,513
and submerge the strips in cold water

288
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,749
to stop the curing process.

289
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,658
then an automated machine chops the strips

290
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,427
into pieces the size of erasers.

291
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,066
now back to the all-pink erasers.

292
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,003
the rubber squares come out of their cold-water bath

293
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,538
and go through a machine

294
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,876
that cuts strips with beveled edges...

295
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,813
then chops the strips into erasers.

296
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:22,552
from there, the erasers drop into a giant barrel.

297
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,554
workers throw in some talc

298
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,690
to prevent them from sticking together.

299
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,893
then they set the barrel spinning

300
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,628
for three to five hours.

301
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,698
as the erasers tumble against each other,

302
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,234
the abrasion rounds off their edges.

303
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,572
the last step is printing.

304
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,576
a machine stamps each eraser

305
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,813
with the company name and the model number.

306
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,588
it's not the rubber that gives the eraser the ability to erase,

307
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,060
but rather the vulcanized vegetable oil that's in it.

308
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,829
that's what makes the eraser crumble when rubbed on paper,

309
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,066
taking away the pencil marks with it.
