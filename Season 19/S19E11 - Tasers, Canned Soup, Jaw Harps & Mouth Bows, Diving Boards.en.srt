00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,988
narrator: a taser device fires bursts of electricity  

4
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,991
to deliver a high-voltage, low-amp shock         

5
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,794
that temporarily disables the subject.     

6
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:05,464
invented in 1969 by      
an american aerospace scientist,

7
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,267
the taser has become a weapon of choice           

8
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,870
for police forces around the world.       

9
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,143
today, when an officer reaches for his or her gun,  

10
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,145
it's often one without bullets.

11
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,081
from a cartridge on the front, 

12
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,550
the taser fires electrified darts,    

13
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,486
which, on impact, cause muscle contractions   

14
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,287
in the target's subject.    

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,157
the subject is immobilized   

16
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,093
but usually recovers in a few minutes.       

17
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:38,497
this metal capsule contains  
the propellant, pressurized gas.

18
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,301
a robotic arm inserts the capsule in a plastic chamber. 

19
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:46,038
the next robot places a part, called the primer disc,    

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,373
on the capsule.        

21
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,443
it contains chemicals to generate a mini explosion  

22
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,845
that will drive pins into the capsule,       

23
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,847
releasing the gas.       

24
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,717
another robot adds a protective screen.   

25
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,385
that's the primer disc on the left          

26
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,321
and the screen on the right.  

27
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,057
they punch out a round piece of foam,            

28
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:09,195
and the robot thrusts it into the chamber and tamps it down. 

29
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:12,998
after welding it in place with ultrasonic vibrations,  

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,103
a robot flips the unit up and into a second plastic chamber. 

31
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,940
the placement leaves just enough space       

32
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,142
between the inner and outer chambers       

33
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,344
for wire bundles to be inserted later.     

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,152
a robot then tucks the assembly
into the plastic cartridge.  

35
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,353
it has slots for other components,     

36
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,024
like insulated copper-wire bundles.      

37
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:43,028
a machine winds the wire in a tight figure-eight formation.

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,799
this wire will electrify the darts as they're deployed, 

39
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,701
and the figure-eight winding  

40
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:51,370
reduces the possibility of tangling.          

41
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,973
a worker places two bundles in the designated spaces    

42
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,308
in the cartridge.       

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,246
he tops each bundle with a piece
of strong polyester film.   

44
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,982
it keeps the wire pack from spring apart       

45
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:07,252
as he slides it off the fork and
presses it into the cartridge. 

46
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,256
he's now ready for the barbed taser darts.  

47
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:14,427
he threads the end of each wire 
bundle through one and knots it.

48
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,064
he installs the darts in the cartridge,       

49
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,868
using a special tool to seat them correctly.    

50
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,138
he selects plastic wedges -- one for each wire --      

51
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,874
and wraps the other end of the wires around it.    

52
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,142
he attaches electrodes     

53
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,678
to facilitate the flow of electricity         

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,779
to the cartridge.       

55
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,617
the next part is called the blast door.   

56
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,153
it will blast apart and break in two        

57
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,155
as the taser darts are deployed.

58
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:46,625
the robot snaps it in place on top of the cartridge.    

59
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,160
the door is color-coded    

60
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,963
to signify the range of the dart probes.       

61
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,898
yellow indicates five yards.  

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,834
with the compressed-air cartridge complete,      

63
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,304
they now focus on the taser's deployment mechanisms. 

64
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,841
a technician installs a laser system    

65
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,977
and two l.e.d. lights in the plastic casing.     

66
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,513
the laser is an aide for aiming the electrified darts, 

67
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,049
and the lights will illuminate the target.  

68
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,852
he adjusts the laser's aim   

69
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:15,120
to sync it with one of the darts,     

70
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,323
using a bull's-eye target as an alignment aide.     

71
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,193
next, they immerse the high-voltage board     

72
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:24,330
in epoxy resin and pump more directly into it.

73
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,132
this board is in the part of the taser gun        

74
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:30,669
that generates electrical pulses
when the gun is in stun mode. 

75
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,004
once cured,          

76
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:35,674
the epoxy encapsulates this unit
to insulate the components.  

77
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,543
the technician inserts the high-voltage board 

78
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,812
in the gun casing.       

79
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,081
along with the controller board --    

80
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,616
the brains of the taser --   

81
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,685
he also installs an information display board  

82
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,221
and makes the necessary connections.   

83
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:52,023
he plugs the assembly into a power source      

84
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,593
and tests the laser and l.e.d. lights.       

85
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,164
he snaps on the trigger    

86
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,232
and confirms that it makes contact     

87
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,434
with the plunger on the control board.     

88
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,639
he joins the other half of the taser casing      

89
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,041
to the one with all the working parts.  

90
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,978
then, an ultrasonic welder fuses the casing parts     

91
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,780
at the tongue and groove seams.

92
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,983
protecting the outer casing with a sheet of plastic,    

93
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,519
the technician welds a safety switch to the trigger.

94
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,790
this critical part will prevent
accidental deployment.     

95
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,258
in a test chamber now,     

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,328
they activate the taser without the air cartridge.   

97
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,597
without the cartridge and its projectile darts,   

98
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,934
the taser works as a handheld stun gun     

99
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,135
to zap the target directly.  

100
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,272
once it meets the tester's approval,     

101
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,942
this taser is ready for the police beat.      

102
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,077
a consumer model is also approved        

103
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,945
for use in some jurisdictions. 

104
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,480
like the police version,    

105
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,150
it should deliver a shocking performance.    

106
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,697
narrator: soup is a liquid food     

107
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,232
that is as old as cooking itself.       

108
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,902
its appeal is quite literally biblical  

109
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,904
because in the old testament, 

110
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:15,107
a son trades his inheritance for a pot of lentil soup.   

111
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:16,242
of course, today,       

112
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,111
one doesn't have to sacrifice it all for soup   

113
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,914
because it's usually readily available in cans.   

114
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,987
with the invention of canning in the early 19th century,   

115
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,456
soup soon became available on demand.           

116
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,860
on the home front, this caused quite a stir.   

117
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,795
no need for a long simmer.   

118
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,865
just open the can, reheat, and soup's on.     

119
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,137
to manufacture lentil soup, they make a hearty soup base. 

120
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,208
they load measured amounts into a heated mixer,      

121
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,743
beginning with purée garlic.  

122
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,079
the mixer's walls are steam-jacketed       

123
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,683
so the mix will cook evenly  
with no scorching on the bottom.

124
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,952
the next ingredient is olive oil.         

125
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:04,689
they activate the steam heat, 
and the garlic begins to sizzle.

126
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,492
they add chopped onion.    

127
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:12,364
the mixing blades gently toss the ingredients as they sauté. 

128
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:16,702
they blend in diced celery and cook until translucent.  

129
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:21,440
the next round of ingredients takes the flavor up a notch.  

130
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:26,312
they include chopped carrots, sea salt, and fragrant spices. 

131
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,117
balsamic vinegar adds a sweet tartness     

132
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,819
to this lentil-soup base.   

133
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,391
they're now ready to liquify the ingredients.  

134
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,728
they open the tap, and filtered water spills in. 

135
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,863
as the soup begins to simmer, 

136
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,665
they add crushed and diced tomatoes.      

137
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,403
the final ingredient      
for this robust lentil-soup base

138
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,538
is spinach.          

139
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,340
mixing it makes for a colorful swirl,  

140
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,409
and, as the ingredients cook, 

141
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,045
they become increasingly aromatic.     

142
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,683
meanwhile, raw, peeled potatoes

143
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,619
ride a steep and slatted conveyor upward.  

144
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,622
the slats keep the potatoes from rolling back       

145
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,425
as they make the climb up to a hopper.        

146
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,095
from the hopper, the potatoes slide down a chute

147
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,966
and into a revolving drum with cross-cutting blades.   

148
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,970
the blades cut the spuds into small cubes and spit them out. 

149
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,639
after a trip past a metal detector,     

150
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,641
the potato cubes land in a bin.

151
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,880
in small-cube form, they'll cook faster later.   

152
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,052
next, lentils, hard and dried, 

153
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:44,990
surge in a steady stream onto a revolving round table. 

154
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,727
the table has openings that lead
to little chutes with doors.  

155
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,530
they open to funnel the lentils
into cans           

156
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,331
moving on a conveyor below.  

157
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,102
this ensures that a specific amount is fed into the cans.  

158
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,875
partially cooked green beans and the raw potato cubes    

159
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,445
now flow onto a second revolving table. 

160
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:12,751
the cans with the lentils have now moved into position below. 

161
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,654
the veggies fall through the holes and into the cans.  

162
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,425
the cans, with mostly uncooked ingredients,     

163
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,096
now head towards the piston filler.       

164
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:27,299
it pipes the steaming hot vegetable-soup base      

165
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,568
directly from the kettle mixer into the cans,         

166
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,337
filling them to the brim.   

167
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,975
immersed in the hot liquid,  

168
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,377
the lentils, potatoes, and green beans        

169
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,381
at the base of the can cook a little and soften up.  

170
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:47,785
sensors detect the approach of the cans and cue the lids. 

171
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:52,190
the lids drop one by one onto the cans below.      

172
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,927
a device then interlocks the rims of the cans

173
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,797
and the lids for a hermetic seal.      

174
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,734
the cans move into another lane

175
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,703
and travel past an x-ray machine.       

176
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,076
it scans the soup inside for metal contaminants     

177
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,744
like stray bolts or screws.  

178
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,612
if the images are clear,    

179
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,417
the cans of soup move on to a giant pressure cooker.  

180
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,687
here, the contents cook under pressure for about a half hour.

181
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,492
pressure-cooking simulates the effect of a long simmer  

182
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:28,493
in a fraction of the time.   

183
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,230
the soup then cools for 10 minutes.        

184
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,233
it is now thoroughly cooked and preserved.         

185
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,971
now on their sides with glue applied,       

186
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,440
the cans of lentil soup roll over labels,       

187
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:42,774
and the labels adhere.     

188
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,648
they produce more than 15,000 cans of lentil soup an hour  

189
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,182
at this factory.        

190
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,385
that's 105,000 cans in one shift.         

191
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,489
it's enough to feed a small city.     

192
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,208
narrator: the jaw harp and the mouth bow 

193
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,611
are among the earliest musical instruments.      

194
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:23,014
a chinese drawing from the 4th century b.c.   

195
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,550
is believed to be the first record of a musician      

196
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,618
playing a jaw harp,      

197
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,087
and cave paintings in southern france       

198
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,489
from 15,000 b.c.        

199
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,258
depict someone playing a mouth bow.      

200
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,431
the mouth bow is a stick of wood       

201
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,435
with a single string the musician plucks or strums, 

202
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,170
while altering the vibration-generated sound   

203
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,238
by mouth.           

204
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,576
the jaw harp is a metal instrument.     

205
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:53,245
the musician plucks its flexible tongue   

206
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:56,714
to produce a twanging sound, which he then modulates    

207
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,250
with mouth positions and breathing.         

208
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,053
this craftsman makes the jaw harp's frame   

209
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,123
out of 1/10 of an inch thick square steel rod.       

210
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,927
he measures and marks the   
required length and bend points.

211
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,997
he cuts the length with a standard hacksaw...   

212
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,799
clamps the rod in a vice...  

213
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,535
then slips metal pipes over the ends         

214
00:12:16,537 --> 00:12:19,738
to prevent them from twisting as he bends them 

215
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,640
to form the arms of the frame. 

216
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,543
he aligns the arms,      

217
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,945
leaving just enough space between them          

218
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,882
to allow the tongue to vibrate without obstruction.

219
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,618
for the instrument to produce quality sound,   

220
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,754
the arms must be perfectly parallel to each other --    

221
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,357
their edges in mirror image.  

222
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:44,429
he marks the tongue's position in between the arms      

223
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,165
and files down the metal within the markings.      

224
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,202
this creates a notch in which the tongue will sit. 

225
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,508
the tongue is made of spring steel --   

226
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,843
a type of steel, which when bent,        

227
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,579
resumes its original shape.  

228
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,516
before attaching it,      

229
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:08,120
he saws a tiny undercut in each side of the notch.   

230
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,792
then he inserts the tongue and hammers the undercut sides 

231
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,462
to compress them over the tongue
and lock it into position.   

232
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:22,601
he heats the tip of the tongue with a propane torch.     

233
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,870
once the metal softens enough to bend,        

234
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,739
he angles the tip to form what's called the trigger.   

235
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,007
then he heats the end of the trigger         

236
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,609
and bends it into a loop.   

237
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,279
this is what the musician's finger strikes 

238
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,981
to make the tongue vibrate.  

239
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,753
finally, he files the tongue's edges sharp --  

240
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:45,724
a last detail to improve the instrument's sound quality.

241
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,428
to make a mouth bow,      

242
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,431
his first step is to find a stick       

243
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,234
that's between roughly 1 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet long,      

244
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,569
not too heavy,         

245
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,838
and ideally with a "t" shape at the end.  

246
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,042
in his workshop, he clamps it in a vice,    

247
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,178
trims it to the required length,

248
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,113
and, using a rasp, files the knots flat.     

249
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:13,117
he files the top end until it's
about 2/10 of an inch thick.  

250
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,853
this forms the mouthpiece,   

251
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,456
which you hold gently to your lips          

252
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,190
while plucking the string.   

253
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,726
the string vibrates the mouthpiece,    

254
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,461
producing sounds that you alter

255
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,729
by changing the shape of your mouth.         

256
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,532
he drills a hole toward the base
of the mouthpiece       

257
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,735
for the string, then, just below that,     

258
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,873
files a notch for the bridge that supports the string.   

259
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:39,811
just below the notch, he hammers
in a steel nail called the pin. 

260
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,346
he drills a 2/10 of an inch hole

261
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,949
at the "t"-shaped end of the stick.         

262
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,218
this is where he'll insert the tuning peg,        

263
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,756
which he constructs out of a wood knob and dow.  

264
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,630
he makes the string from a length of piano wire.  

265
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,565
he forms a loop at one end   

266
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,368
by twisting it with pliers around an awl.         

267
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,904
he feeds this end through the hole        

268
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,039
at the base of the mouthpiece...

269
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,413
...and hooks the loop onto the pin.         

270
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,520
then he threads the other end of the string         

271
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,721
through a hole in the shaft at the tuning peg       

272
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,956
at the bottom of the stick.  

273
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,328
he turns the peg to tighten the string.     

274
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,864
just as on a violin or a guitar,

275
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:37,469
the tauter the string,     
the higher the note it produces.

276
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,272
[ creaking ]          

277
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,408
[ creaking continues ]     

278
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,277
the final step is to position the bridge --  

279
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,546
a hardwood dow --       

280
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:50,215
in its notch, under the tense string.    

281
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,884
by elevating the top of the string,         

282
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,421
the bridge prevents it from cutting into the stick.  

283
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,427
the mouth bow and the jaw harp are played alone        

284
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,296
or alongside other instruments 

285
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,499
in the folk music of numerous cultures around the world.   

286
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,452
narrator: the earliest known reference to a diving board   

287
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,322
appears in a hieroglyphic from 480 b.c.         

288
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:35,327
it depicts a man plunging headfirst into a pool of water 

289
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,594
from a platform.        

290
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,664
today, diving boards are standard equipment     

291
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,034
at neighborhood and backyard swimming pools.  

292
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,006
one end of the diving board is fixed            

293
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,543
to give the other end the bounce required      

294
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:54,713
for a big-splash cannonball or a graceful swan dive.    

295
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,551
to make the diving-board shell,

296
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,620
workers load a sheet of acrylic           

297
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,723
into a clamping machine    
that transports it into an oven.

298
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,363
the oven heats the sheet for about 30 seconds to soften it. 

299
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,832
then, a forming machine applies suction        

300
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,835
to draw the softened acrylic tightly over a mold      

301
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,305
in the shape of two diving boards.     

302
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,773
fans blow cool air,      

303
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:25,309
hardening the acrylic to this shape within seconds. 

304
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,512
they extract the molded acrylic,

305
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:31,983
then saw it in half to separate
the two diving-board shells.  

306
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:36,688
they coat the shell surface in a resin and fiberglass mixture.

307
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,592
this tool is called a chopper gun    

308
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,728
because it chops and shreds the fiberglass string,     

309
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,498
then shoots it out drenched in resin.       

310
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,872
they roll it to compress the  
fibers and push out air pockets.

311
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:58,076
any trapped air would create  
a weak spot in the diving board.

312
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,679
after letting the resin dry and harden for 30 minutes,   

313
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,214
they begin filling the shell cavity    

314
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,217
with 2/10 of an inch thick fiberglass mat.        

315
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:09,220
they drench the mat in resin, rolling it over        

316
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:14,492
to ensure every fraction of an inch gets well-saturated.

317
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,361
then they lay down another fiberglass mat,    

318
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,896
this one a bit thinner     

319
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,600
and saturated with the existing resin.    

320
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,570
the diving board's core is made of laminated wood,   

321
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,640
which is several thin layers of wood glued together.    

322
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,043
laminated wood is actually stronger      

323
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,812
than a solid piece of wood.  

324
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:40,118
after rounding the top edge,  
they lay two wood-laminate cores

325
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,088
over the            
resin-saturated fiberglass mats.

326
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,393
they position clamps to hold the cores in place.  

327
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,796
but before tightening, they insert metal spacers   

328
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,000
to ensure the cores are correctly positioned    

329
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,334
within the shell.       

330
00:18:56,336 --> 00:19:00,338
once the positioning is perfect,
they tighten the clamps,    

331
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,541
then let the resin cure at room temperature      

332
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,110
for a half hour or so.     

333
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,881
then the clamps come off, and workers cover the cores  

334
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,819
with an even thicker fiberglass
mat impregnated with resin.  

335
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,195
this is the bottom of the diving board.      

336
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,706
they make sure the mat is centered...         

337
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,244
then manually form it to the shape of the board,   

338
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:43,081
pushing out the air pockets as they go.          

339
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,923
they spray on some decorative paint,     

340
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:56,728
then put the board in an oven for 24 hours to cure.     

341
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,929
when it comes out,       

342
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,065
they use a diamond blade    
to saw off the excess fiberglass

343
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,467
around the edge.        

344
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,474
then they do a final trimming 

345
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,676
to make the edge neat and smooth.          

346
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,218
they mask the sides with tape, leaving only the top exposed.  

347
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,021
this is where they'll now apply
a rough texture --       

348
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,724
a safe, non-slip surface.   

349
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,862
first, they roll on a thin coat of resin.     

350
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,768
onto that, they sprinkle a layer
of silica sand,        

351
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,537
making sure to cover the surface
thoroughly and evenly.     

352
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,841
the sand sticks to the resin, 

353
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,377
which sets and cures in about 15 minutes.      

354
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,115
after sweeping off the excess sand that didn't adhere,

355
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,317
they roll on a coat of laminating resin,      

356
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,119
which bonds to the sand,    

357
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,289
giving the surface a clean, finished look.         

358
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,731
they pull off the tape     

359
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,101
and apply the         
manufacture's decal to the side.

360
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,338
the diving board is now all set
to be installed        

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,008
on a stand at the edge of the deep end  

362
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,911
to await anyone ready to take the plunge.   

363
