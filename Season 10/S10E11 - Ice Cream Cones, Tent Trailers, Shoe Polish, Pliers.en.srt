insert the bars -- one near the

now the frames go for a dip in a

toe, the other near the heel.   
now the frames go for a dip in a

in keeping with tradition, the  

406
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,778
frames are ready for lacing.    
in keeping with tradition, the

a skilled weaver threads her

thread that runs along the

she nimbly builds up a pattern  
of webbing that always begins   

416
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,928
she nimbly builds up a pattern  
of webbing that always begins   
and ends with a series of       

417
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,229
of webbing that always begins   
and ends with a series of       
triangular shapes.              

418
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,231
and ends with a series of       
triangular shapes.              
this intricate weaving technique

419
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,066
triangular shapes.              
this intricate weaving technique
is a traditional skill passed

this intricate weaving technique
is a traditional skill passed   
down through generations of     

421
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:10,207
is a traditional skill passed   
down through generations of     
native canadian women.          

422
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,042
down through generations of     
native canadian women.          
she finishes by wrapping up the 

423
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,544
native canadian women.          
she finishes by wrapping up the 
heel end of the frame with      

424
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:19,483
she finishes by wrapping up the 
heel end of the frame with      
rawhide then pulls it tight.    

425
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,884
heel end of the frame with      
rawhide then pulls it tight.    
now that the toe piece is       

426
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,586
rawhide then pulls it tight.    
now that the toe piece is       
finished, she starts weaving the

427
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,520
now that the toe piece is       
finished, she starts weaving the
middle piece.                   

428
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,355
finished, she starts weaving the
middle piece.                   
using a large width of rawhide, 

429
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,990
middle piece.                   
using a large width of rawhide, 
she builds up another web of    

430
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,693
using a large width of rawhide, 
she builds up another web of    
triangles, this time knotting   

431
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,460
she builds up another web of    
triangles, this time knotting   
the strips directly onto the    

432
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,929
triangles, this time knotting   
the strips directly onto the    
frame.                          

433
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,337
finally, she weaves an opening  

434
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,039
to leave room for the bindings  

435
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,841
that hold the snowshoe to your  

436
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:44,375
boot.                           

437
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,176
once the rawhide dries, the     

438
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,178
webbing will lie taut across the

439
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,649
frame.                          

440
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,650
the last step -- another coat of

441
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,519
varnish to seal and protect both

442
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,322
the wood and webbing.           

443
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,956
and now these traditional       

444
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,725
snowshoes are ready to make     

445
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,231
some tracks.
