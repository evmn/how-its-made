00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,690
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,492
ice-cream cones...       

5
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,165
...tent trailers...      

6
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,937
...shoe polish...       

7
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,576
...and pliers.         

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,321
the ice-cream cone is the original edible container. 

9
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:59,191
invented over a century ago, it adds crunch         

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,726
to the melt-in-your-mouth taste
of ice cream.         

11
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:04,863
and it's one container that  
doesn't end up in the trash can,

12
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,199
so you could say it adds a bit of virtue        

13
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,635
to the guilty pleasure of the double scoop.      

14
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,077
the first ice-cream cones were rolled waffles.      

15
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,680
and today's cones are simply modern versions of that.    

16
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,884
waffle-cone batter starts with a lot of dark brown sugar.

17
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,553
caramel coloring is added...  

18
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:33,091
along with some secret flavoring ingredients.     

19
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,093
water is piped into the blender.

20
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,630
it's ice cold to keep the batter
from getting too sticky.    

21
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,570
a computer controls the addition of flour     

22
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,773
from a tank on the floor above.

23
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:51,977
vegetable oil is added     

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,013
as a giant beater mixes all the ingredients.      

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,651
the batter then flows out of the blender       

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,920
and into a refrigerated tank. 

27
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,589
an agitating blade keeps the blend        

28
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,326
at the consistency of pancake batter.       

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,131
next, nozzles deposit batter onto baking plates       

30
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,401
that look like moving waffle irons.   

31
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,071
top plates flip down, and the baking plates roll   

32
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,707
through a glass heated oven for a quick bake.       

33
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,616
the top plates lift up,    

34
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,051
revealing the cooked waffle patties.        

35
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:40,325
automated arms help transfer the patties to rolling tools. 

36
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,666
the tools grab the patties and twist them into cones.   

37
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,175
the cones fall down a chute  

38
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,580
and ride an open elevator up and down to cool and harden.

39
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,720
the waffle cones slide down another chute    

40
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,323
and move into lanes on a conveyor.         

41
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:15,227
automated fingers help guide them into paper jackets. 

42
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,337
a computer with a camera eye counts the cones        

43
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,272
and sends a message to a machine

44
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,875
that stacks them in the right increments.    

45
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,677
here, a technician activates a device       

46
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,480
that pushes on a ball inside a cone         

47
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,548
to test the cone's breaking point.        

48
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:41,019
looks like this waffle cone can
hold up to some heavy licking. 

49
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,088
over in the sugar-cone department, 

50
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,824
the baking-plate system is designed differently.    

51
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,628
it makes patties that are   
fan-shaped and have a flat edge.

52
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,697
this shape, along with a firmer batter,  

53
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,233
means sugar cones are stronger than waffle cones,       

54
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,770
so they're a more popular choice
for hard ice cream.      

55
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:06,245
packers stack the cones in styrofoam trays.      

56
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,381
then the packages travel through a curtain       

57
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,984
of high-density, polyethylene film.       

58
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,789
a heated sealer finishes the wrapping job.   

59
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,592
an x-ray machine sends information about the contents 

60
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,727
to a computer that counts the cones     

61
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:25,097
and alerts inspectors to any problems.        

62
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,269
next, automated arms pick up cartons and open them 

63
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,905
so the packs of cones can be inserted.        

64
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,479
but there's still one more cone variety in the works --  

65
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,813
colorful cake cones.      

66
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,749
cake cones are less sugary than other varieties      

67
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,152
and have a more cake-like texture.       

68
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,621
batter is pumped into upright molds.      

69
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,556
cake cones are shaped differently          

70
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,225
from waffle and sugar cones,  

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,361
because they have flat rather than pointed bottoms.  

72
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,764
metal cores plunge into    
the molds to complete the shape.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,235
this action also enhances the cake cone's flaky texture. 

74
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,708
the cones are baked as they pass
by a gauntlet of gas heaters. 

75
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:13,578
then it's down a chute and off to the packaging station.   

76
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,979
unlike the other cones,    

77
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,315
cake cones come out flaky and crispy           

78
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:20,052
without a cooling-down period. 

79
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,795
a mechanical arm picks up paper sleeves     

80
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,264
and drops them in front of the cones.     

81
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,872
these cones are now on their way
to an ice-cream stand near you,

82
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,609
where they'll be used to scoop up ice cream lickety-split.  

83
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,551
when we return,        

84
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,822
building a tent trailer from the bottom up.      

85
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,027
narrator: tent trailers allow you to travel without reservations.

86
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,830
who needs a hotel if you can park the pop-up?  

87
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,234
besides, you don't get fresh air
and campfires at a hotel.   

88
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,102
tent trailers have been around 

89
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,638
since the early part of the 20th century.      

90
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,075
and you could describe them as an overnight success.    

91
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,515
today's tent trailers are equipped          

92
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,782
with modern conveniences    

93
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,318
that would make anyone a happy camper.        

94
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,853
workers begin production    

95
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,990
by welding tubular steel components together      

96
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,960
to establish a solid framework.

97
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,466
once it's painted, plumbed, and partially wired,      

98
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,835
wheels are bolted into place. 

99
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,409
the water-storage tank goes in next.         

100
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,211
then aircraft-grade steel cables
are strung           

101
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,580
from corner posts to a central bar.       

102
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,553
this bar is called a "whiffletree."        

103
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,221
cranking up the whiffletree  

104
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,023
will cause the cables to lift the corner posts,   

105
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,659
raising the trailer's roof.  

106
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,098
the trailer is wheeled to the next station,      

107
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,567
where workers lower a vinyl-covered wooden floor  

108
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,369
onto the chassis...      

109
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,840
and secure it with screws.   

110
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,442
then they connect a cluster of wires            

111
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,378
to those already installed on the chassis         

112
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,848
to run things like kitchen appliances and stereos.    

113
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,051
the interior front wall is riveted to steel bulkheads 

114
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,521
and the trailer chassis.    

115
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,723
more wiring is threaded through the bulkheads     

116
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,192
to the trailer's side lights, 

117
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,561
and then the exterior panel is installed.         

118
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:49,067
workers slide the roadside panel
over the lift posts      

119
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,669
and secure it.         

120
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:54,005
the curbside exterior panels come in two pieces       

121
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,876
to create a space for the trailer door.     

122
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,479
corner molding completes this assembly.         

123
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,816
next, workers move inside   

124
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,152
and install the framework for some bench seating.    

125
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:11,022
they install the lower cabinetry
for the kitchenette,      

126
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,091
then join it to the upper cabinet      

127
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,260
with a long, metal hinge for easy pivoting.       

128
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,234
a mini fridge is inserted in the lower cabinetry,    

129
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,070
and this folding kitchenette is complete.          

130
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,376
this is the pull-out platform for one of the mattresses.   

131
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,246
it slides into channels in the exterior walls.     

132
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:39,284
but there's a lot more work to 
do before anyone can take a nap.

133
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,923
the trailer's tent is made out of water-resistant fabric. 

134
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,194
the five sections are sewn separately,      

135
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,897
then zipped together at an inspection station.   

136
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,105
inspectors scrutinize every seam for flaws.     

137
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,810
once the tent passes inspection,

138
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,114
it's fit onto the trailer one section at a time.     

139
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,385
now it's time for a little roofing.     

140
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,222
the trailer's roof is made   

141
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,691
by sandwiching together many materials.        

142
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,293
and that takes a lot of industrial adhesive.    

143
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,597
the glue is rolled onto these plywood slats.   

144
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:32,370
these foam insulation boards also get a generous coating.  

145
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,171
workers place the glued foam  

146
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,707
onto the roof's fiberglass outer skin.          

147
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,844
they position the wooden slats along the perimeter      

148
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,114
and add bands of metal for more reinforcement.    

149
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,117
the final layer is vinyl-coated plywood.    

150
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,187
it will be the ceiling of the trailer.        

151
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,958
a large roller compresses the glued layers together.   

152
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,266
after grooves and notches have been cut into the roof,  

153
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,801
it's wired up,         

154
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:05,937
and 12-volt interior lights are installed in the ceiling. 

155
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,074
trim is added to the roof's edges      

156
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,677
along with a gasket to keep it watertight.     

157
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,284
the roof's flaps are folded in a tray-like configuration, 

158
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,219
and the corners are capped.  

159
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,356
workers are now ready to raise the roof and install the tent. 

160
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,091
the assembly is inserted    

161
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,761
into grooves in the trailer ceiling     

162
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,396
using a pneumatic hammer.   

163
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,036
this tent trailer is now ready to pop up anywhere.      

164
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,372
it can accommodate a small family         

165
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,809
and is equipped to feed them outdoors or inside.      

166
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,914
it even comes with a screen door,      

167
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,151
because you never know when adventure will come knocking. 

168
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,893
coming up, a production line you can really take a shine to.

169
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,867
narrator: mud and scuffing have long been
the bane of shoes and boots.  

170
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,068
in mediaeval times, wax was used

171
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,403
to soften and waterproof leather footwear.       

172
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,072
but it had a dull finish.   

173
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,541
it wasn't until the early 20th century  

174
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,810
with the invention of shoe polish         

175
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,579
that footwear really started to shine.    

176
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:32,424
all it takes is a bit of polish
and a lot of elbow grease.   

177
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,629
a vigorous brushing can enhance the job      

178
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,434
and help transform shoes from drab to fab.       

179
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,303
shoe polish starts with mineral spirit solvent  

180
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,339
and different combinations of carnauba wax.        

181
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,118
the waxes go into a melter,  

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,587
where they're heated to 260 degrees.        

183
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,663
the mixture cooks for 15 minutes,        

184
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,365
while beaters keep everything blended together.       

185
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,339
this is dye fluid in a deep-black shade.     

186
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,942
in another tank, the dye fluid and waxes are added      

187
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,078
to the solvent blend.     

188
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,983
agitators mix it for three minutes.       

189
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,757
tin-container bottoms tumble down a chute      

190
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,693
and up a magnetic conveyor belt.

191
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,430
a worker flips the tins right-side up         

192
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,166
then pushes them onto another conveyor.     

193
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:54,272
once they're lined up, they're ready to be filled.  

194
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,646
automated arms space the tins as
they arrive at the filling head.

195
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,050
the filling heads inject hot, liquid shoe polish       

196
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,919
into the tins.         

197
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:14,526
the polish is precisely doled out so there is no spillover. 

198
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,397
the polish now needs to solidify,          

199
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:24,001
so the tins travel through a cooling tunnel.   

200
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,672
when they emerge, the polish is a thick paste.  

201
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,613
workers perform a breaking-strength test    

202
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,150
to be sure the final product has the right consistency.   

203
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,760
the polish-filled tins now funnel onto a conveyor   

204
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,496
that merges with a lid feeder. 

205
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,602
the feeder lowers the lids onto the tins.         

206
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,244
a compression wheel presses the lids in place   

207
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,447
with just the right amount of force.           

208
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,788
and this polish is now ready to shine.           

209
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,663
there's a different packaging system for liquid shoe polish. 

210
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,867
a blow molding machine forces hot air into plastic  

211
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,401
to form containers.      

212
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:34,138
then the mechanized rack holding the containers rotates 

213
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,076
and places the newly formed bottles on another conveyor.  

214
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,350
it moves them under a flame, which melts the rough edges.  

215
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,153
revolving conveyors move under filling heads,      

216
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,257
which pump in liquid polish.  

217
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,165
workers insert valves into applicators.       

218
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,572
then this machine press-fits the applicators   

219
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:11,042
onto the polish-filled containers.          

220
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,248
using hydraulic pressure,   

221
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:21,519
another machine snaps clear domes onto the applicators.  

222
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,059
rollers affix labels onto both sides of the bottles.

223
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,732
the bottles then move through an inspection station. 

224
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:39,003
a mirror helps workers scrutinize the labeling job.  

225
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,073
a technician now takes a preliminary reading     

226
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,409
of the gloss on some leather. 

227
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,810
he applies some paste polish  

228
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,080
and rubs it in with a horsehair brush.    

229
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,815
he takes another reading,   

230
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,819
and the gloss on this leather has increased by a factor of 2,

231
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,288
which means this polish passes muster         

232
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:02,560
and is ready to add some high luster to your footwear. 

233
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,962
when we return, plier production --      

234
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,165
the gripping truth.      

235
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,370
narrator: pliers date back to around 2,000 b.c.      

236
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,706
ancient drawings show greek gods
with pliers at the forge.   

237
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,176
today, forgers still make pliers,   

238
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,179
but these days, they use automated tools    

239
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,380
to shape the metal.      

240
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,249
without them,         
a lot of electricians, plumbers,

241
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,252
and mechanics would be out of a job.     

242
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,660
pliers have three basic parts --
handles, a rivet, and jaws.  

243
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,597
all the parts are made from steel           

244
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,066
that metal workers forge into shape.          

245
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,007
first, a powerful electric furnace  

246
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,877
heats the steel red hot in just a few seconds.     

247
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:59,083
then a metal worker sets one sizzling rod at a time

248
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,418
on a forming die.       

249
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,688
a massive die forger hammers the rod against the die

250
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,023
with tons of force.      

251
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,226
it takes up to four strikes on separate impressions    

252
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,496
for the rod to acquire the die's shape.        

253
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,972
then the forging is placed onto a press          

254
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,908
that trims off any excess steel.

255
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:36,386
two forged rods are needed to make one pair of pliers.  

256
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,355
this pair will be for gripping,

257
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,859
so the next step is to machine the teeth into the jaws.    

258
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,396
workers set the plier halves into the broaching machine.  

259
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,698
its tiny cutters, dozens of them,        

260
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,269
shave away steel under a shower of lubricant.  

261
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,740
when the cutters pull away,  

262
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,377
the jaw of each plier half now has a nice set of teeth.  

263
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,149
the factory must heat-treat the steel to harden it,    

264
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,017
a process called "austempering."

265
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,087
the plier halves travel through a gas-fired furnace  

266
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,291
for about 2 hours at a blazing 1,500 degrees.  

267
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,094
then the steel is dunked in salt water         

268
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,063
to cool rapidly and evenly.  

269
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,504
the teeth on these pliers will have to take a lot of abuse,  

270
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,506
so they get a laser-heat treatment     

271
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,375
to make them even harder and more durable.       

272
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,047
now the pliers are ready for assembly.         

273
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,816
for gripping pliers, a worker inserts a single piece ribbon 

274
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,386
and joins the two halves.   

275
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,455
he then sets the joint onto a machine         

276
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,990
that spins at high speed,   

277
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,992
generating the force and friction needed      

278
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,627
to set the rivet.       

279
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,331
cutting pliers are also held together with a rivet,  

280
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,267
but the setting process is different.         

281
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,406
the parts go into a press that applies both heat and pressure 

282
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,108
to secure the rivet firmly.  

283
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,684
next, workers insert the cutting pliers       

284
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,886
between two stone grinding wheels.        

285
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,023
again, lubricant prevents the steel from overheating   

286
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,225
as the wheels wear down the rivet      

287
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,995
until it lies flush with the plier surface.    

288
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,635
the cutting pliers go into a gas oven        

289
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,037
for another two hours of heat treating,       

290
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,972
a process called "martempering."

291
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,181
when they come out, they cool in an oil solution  

292
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:47,651
rather than the salt solution that cools the gripping pliers.

293
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,521
steel is a finicky material, so it's critical        

294
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,657
to manage the heat-treating process meticulously.     

295
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,260
otherwise, the metal will be substandard. 

296
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,064
after heat-treating, the pliers
go into a bath of rust inhibitor

297
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,666
that helps protect the steel from corrosion         

298
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,536
and lubricates the riveted joints.      

299
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:09,339
a robotic arm runs one pair of pliers at a time      

300
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,808
against a grinding belt,    

301
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,645
polishing all surfaces except the handles for a sleek finish.

302
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:25,156
then a laser engraves the   
company logo and product number.

303
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,762
automated bars now lower hundreds of pliers handle deep 

304
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,398
into a tank containing liquid vinyl.         

305
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,233
no messy drips here.      

306
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,169
before dipping, the factory heat the pliers  

307
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,973
to help this coating stick to the steel.         

308
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,049
next, the pliers go into an oven.         

309
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,652
the heat hardens the protective coating,    

310
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:58,255
cushioning the handles so they're easier on the hands.

311
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:02,126
whatever their shape or size, pliers are a toolbox essential 

312
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,363
for anyone looking to ply their trade.      

313
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,334
