00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:25,725
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,519
cars powered by electricity  

3
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:58,524
were being developed as early as the 1820s.         

4
00:00:58,593 --> 00:00:59,791
in recent years,        

5
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,128
legislative initiatives improved batteries,      

6
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,331
and accessible methods of recharging         

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,867
have made electric vehicles more popular.     

8
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,409
charging stations       
provide electricity to customers

9
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,477
with electric vehicles.    

10
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,946
it's simply a matter of swiping an access card   

11
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,415
across the reader,       

12
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,552
verifying the customer's account,            

13
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,954
and then plugging the charging station connector 

14
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,323
into the vehicle.       

15
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,426
the charging station      

16
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,295
provides electricity to the charger in the vehicle. 

17
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:40,966
it can take one to six hours before it's fully recharged.  

18
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,534
the blinking light stops,   

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,770
charging is under way.     

20
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:48,974
a laser cutter         

21
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:52,845
automatically slices through oxidized aluminum sheets.   

22
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:54,313
in a matter of minutes,    

23
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:56,582
the pre-programmed cuts are complete.         

24
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,588
a worker carefully removes the cut pieces of aluminum.  

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,490
unused pieces will be recycled.

26
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,863
another worker bends the aluminum on a bending post.

27
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,734
he places the aluminum piece in a bending machine.     

28
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,005
then, he positions the bent piece  

29
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,575
in a pre-programmed robotic welding machine.    

30
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,281
it automatically and quickly  

31
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,752
welds the pieces of aluminum together.           

32
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:36,355
the worker polishes the welded joints using a soft cloth   

33
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,491
to make certain they're smooth to the touch.  

34
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,561
polishing away rough edges makes the finished face plate 

35
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,397
safe for use by customers.   

36
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,367
a worker assembles the painted face plate     

37
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:51,704
and the head of the charging station.    

38
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,906
he screws the face plate to the head          

39
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,708
and attaches the user interface protection, 

40
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,678
which is made of tempered glass.

41
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,915
he places a flexible strip of light-emitting diodes    

42
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,719
around the perimeter of the light diffuser.     

43
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,787
different colored lights tell the customer       

44
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,656
whether the station is available          

45
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,993
and whether vehicle charging is under way.         

46
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:17,262
he then places the protector cap
containing the light strip   

47
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:21,734
and the antenna on the head of the charging station.    

48
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,738
next, he connects the various components housed in the head 

49
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,141
of the charging station.    

50
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,278
these include circuit boards, the antenna connection,    

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,613
digital display, and card reader.        

52
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,752
he inserts the control circuit board,         

53
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,154
which has the central processing unit,  

54
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,822
the antenna interface,     

55
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,626
digital display, and card reader on the other side. 

56
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:51,030
he uses a flat cable to connect
the 40 small connectors    

57
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,032
of the control-printed circuit board         

58
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,100
to the power-printed circuit board.         

59
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,837
he inserts it into the head of the charging station,    

60
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,505
on top of the control-printed circuit board.         

61
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,842
he finishes attaching the quick connecters.     

62
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,781
a worker seals the edges of the charging station head  

63
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,248
with rubber stripping     

64
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,352
to protect the components inside
from the elements outside.   

65
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,925
he positions the aluminum back plate    

66
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,660
on the charging station head, 

67
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,328
and once that's in place,   

68
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,397
he attaches the charging cable assembly  

69
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,899
to the connector module.    

70
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,806
the worker slips the charging cable wires    

71
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,875
into the frame of the connector module    

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,643
and securely tightens them.  

73
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:43,682
then, he positions the connector module door   

74
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:46,018
against the frame that holds it in place.    

75
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,091
he attaches them securely to each other,         

76
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:54,026
using quick-connect connecters,

77
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,695
he attaches part of the plug that links the charging station

78
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,130
to the vehicle.        

79
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:03,235
to make sure everything is working properly,      

80
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,841
the worker tests the door sensor
and the door locking system.  

81
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,844
his test confirms the sensor is functioning,        

82
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,512
and the door locks correctly. 

83
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,385
he now attaches the connector module      

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,954
to the head of the charging station.    

85
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:27,726
then, he places the head of the charging station    

86
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,295
onto its pedestal base.    

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,134
whether it's being removed or attached to a vehicle,   

88
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,605
one safety feature is that   
the connector is never energized

89
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,741
when being handled by a customer.         

90
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:46,378
once the charge is complete, the vehicle is ready to roll. 

91
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,162
narrator: grappa is an italian brandy,  

92
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,765
traditionally an after dinner drink.     

93
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,166
it's made from pomace,     

94
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,368
what's left of grapes     

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,904
after they've been pressed to make wine.     

96
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,505
distilleries ferment the pomace

97
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,708
to convert the sugars into alcohol,         

98
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,044
then distill it to transform the alcohol and other compounds

99
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,679
into grappa.          

100
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:26,585
traditional grappa is colorless.

101
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,720
it can also be aged in wooden barrels       

102
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,455
to produce different varieties,

103
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:35,193
with a specific color, taste, and aroma.       

104
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,530
you can't make grappa without someone first making wine,   

105
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:43,335
because wine-making leftovers are the sole ingredient.    

106
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,070
in italy, the wine harvest   

107
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,673
begins in late summer or early fall,         

108
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,676
depending on the weather and region of the country.   

109
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:55,147
the harvested grapes go directly
from the vineyard to the winery.

110
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:58,284
there, the first machine pulls them off the stocks,   

111
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,752
which are later composted into fertilizer        

112
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,288
for farms and nurseries.    

113
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,759
the destocked grapes enter a cylindrical press.   

114
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,426
they're crushed against the walls       

115
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,229
with an airbag-like device   

116
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,964
to extract the juice and pulp for making wine.        

117
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,500
what's left behind in the press,

118
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,635
once the juice and pulp drain out,      

119
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:22,107
are the skins, seeds, some residual juice, and pulp.   

120
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,976
this is called pomace.     

121
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,910
the winery sells it to distilleries    

122
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:28,179
that produce grappa.      

123
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:32,651
this small artisanal distillery
produces premium quality grappa

124
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:36,455
by using only pomace from grapes
pressed that very same day.  

125
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,859
the pomace goes into temperature
controlled fermentation tanks 

126
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,528
as soon as it arrives.     

127
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,400
large industrial distilleries operate differently,      

128
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,403
typically warehousing pomace prior to processing,      

129
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,539
sometimes for months.     

130
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:57,409
this delay produces high levels
of potentially toxic methanol, 

131
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,145
which the distillery then has to remove       

132
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,114
using an additional procedure. 

133
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:07,886
the distillers monitor ph and alcohol levels to determine

134
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,757
when the conversion of sugars to alcohol is complete.    

135
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,827
the process          
takes from three days to a week,

136
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,095
depending on the variety    

137
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,132
of grape and other factors,  
such as the outdoor temperature.

138
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,303
when the pomace is ready,   

139
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,139
they transfer it to wood-clad copper stills.  

140
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,709
they heat the stills with steam,

141
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,979
bringing the pomace to the boiling point,     

142
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:38,117
which transforms the alcohol and other compounds into steam.

143
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:42,454
this alcohol steam inside the still rises to the top   

144
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,523
and exits through a side hole. 

145
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,526
it travels through copper pipes
and other equipment,      

146
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,195
ultimately to a condensation system,   

147
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,597
which cools the steam back to liquid.           

148
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,333
this liquid is grappa.     

149
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,402
as it exits distillation,   

150
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,471
the master distiller meticulously          

151
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:03,142
monitors the temperature and alcohol level.       

152
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:06,010
she discards the initial and final flows,        

153
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,614
capturing only the perfectly pure mid flow,  

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,617
referred to as the heart of the grappa.         

155
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,622
its alcohol level at this point
is 70% to 77%.         

156
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,160
certain varieties now go to the cellar,     

157
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:25,164
into small wooden barrels to age.            

158
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,831
over time, both the grappa   

159
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,501
and the wooden barrels exchange compounds,      

160
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,104
which influence taste, aroma, and color.           

161
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,174
for example, a barrel made of cherry wood will produce  

162
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,311
different characteristics than one made of oak.     

163
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,847
the distilleries' experts   

164
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,849
analyze and taste samples following distillation     

165
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,718
and throughout the aging period.

166
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,319
depending on the variety,   

167
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:52,124
this can range from just one year to more than 20 years.  

168
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,997
whether the grappa is aged or not, prior to bottling,   

169
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,668
they filter and dilute it with the mineralized water.  

170
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,770
this lowers the alcohol content

171
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,806
from an average of 77% after distillation       

172
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,876
to the target level of 41% to 50%.         

173
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,218
they seal the bottles     

174
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,155
with stoppers made of food-safe synthetic materials 

175
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,224
rather than traditional corks. 

176
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,361
natural cork contains certain organic compounds,   

177
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,731
which can alter the flavor, aroma, and color of the grappa.

178
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,904
they seal the stopper with shrink wrap plastic.   

179
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,039
an unbroken seal assures the buyer       

180
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:44,243
that the bottle has not been previously opened.

181
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,911
then the bottles        
pass through a labeling station.

182
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:51,849
the grappa is ready to be poured as an after-dinner drink

183
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,253
or enjoyed on its own.     

184
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,489
as the italians say, "salut!" 

185
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,340
narrator: on july 26, 1971,       

186
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,810
the apollo 15 space module touched down on the moon,   

187
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,413
and astronauts emerged with a new vehicle,      

188
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,681
the lunar rover.        

189
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,550
they took it for a test drive. 

190
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,352
it handled well on the rough surface of the moon,      

191
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,887
so they could venture further from the landing sight     

192
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,190
and really explore.      

193
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,096
the lunar rover was no ordinary four wheeler. 

194
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,965
millions of dollars of research

195
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,301
went into this one-horsepower wonder,     

196
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:45,903
which became known as the moon buggy.       

197
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,441
today, craftsmen        
build replicas for space museums

198
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,476
and to use as movie props.   

199
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,382
the team starts with      
a substantial suspension system,

200
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:00,819
designed to smooth the ride over the moon's rocky terrain. 

201
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,457
they then install a steering plate at the front.      

202
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,461
they attach actuators,     

203
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,897
which are mechanisms that assist in steering.    

204
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:18,503
they connect the actuator drive
bars to the steering plate.  

205
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,276
together, the steering plate  

206
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,210
and actuators give the lunar rover      

207
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,981
an incredibly tight turning radius of 10 feet.   

208
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,355
they screw support brackets for the actuators       

209
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,023
to the corners of the chassis. 

210
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,296
they then connect the actuators
to them.            

211
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,770
they use steel and aluminum bolts and parts. 

212
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,107
however, on the original moon buggy,  

213
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,175
many parts were made of titanium,     

214
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,579
because it lightened the load carried into space.  

215
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:05,450
titanium is expensive and unnecessary for this replica. 

216
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,786
the fenders are next.     

217
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,188
they are extra large to protect astronauts     

218
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,391
from lunar dust kicked up by the rover.    

219
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,329
they insert a locking mechanism
in a slit           

220
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,065
at the end of the drive shaft 

221
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,200
and slide the wheel hub onto the shaft.        

222
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,974
they turn the hub to lock it in place.      

223
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,142
they're now ready for the wheels.        

224
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,678
in the atmospheric vacuum of the moon,          

225
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,549
air-filled rubber tires were out of the question,   

226
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,819
so the original rover had wire-mesh tires.      

227
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,220
to mimic the look,       

228
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,958
they've wrapped a wire lattice around rubber tires.      

229
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,828
the team secures the wheel to the hub           

230
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:52,030
with a plastic and aluminum cap

231
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,766
that's equipped with locking pins.       

232
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,070
they give it a spin and install
the other three wheels.    

233
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,778
next, a technician assembles the instrument panel.

234
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,115
he inserts various switches and gauges into their slots... 

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,121
...including this system reset switch.   

236
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,057
it's used to bring the displays
back to zero          

237
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,625
prior to an expedition.    

238
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,467
he closes a two piece collar  
around the bottom of the switch.

239
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,274
he locks it in place with a top cap.        

240
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,815
he then flips the panel around 

241
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,518
and tightens the nut on the back part of the switch.

242
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,426
with the system reset switch now attached,         

243
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,029
the instrument panel is complete.          

244
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,698
he places it in the housing.  

245
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,237
he installs metal bars around the switches      

246
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,774
to keep them          
from being accidentally tripped.

247
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,578
he assembles the steering handle,            

248
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,916
which is a t-shaped joystick, next to the instrument panel. 

249
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,720
they now transfer the steering and instrument panel assembly 

250
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,888
to the vehicle.        

251
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,926
they fasten the actuator switches     

252
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:33,999
to the steering housing,    

253
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,936
and then clip the wiring harness
to the floor of the lunar rover.

254
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,540
they cover the bottom of the rover          

255
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,276
with flame-resistant material. 

256
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,149
they lower the electrical control panel and battery   

257
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,418
into the chassis and connect them.       

258
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,355
the original rover had two small batteries,    

259
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:02,093
but the mechanics of      
this replica have had an update.

260
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,494
stay tuned for more,      

261
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,498
as this lunar rover replication
mission continues.       

262
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,251
narrator: the original lunar rover    

263
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,586
weighed just 460 pounds,    

264
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,054
or 77 pounds in moon weight.  

265
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,791
it could carry a load of over twice that.      

266
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,528
at minimal gravity and an atmospheric vacuum,   

267
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,331
it was the only way to travel on the surface of the moon   

268
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,765
in 1971.            

269
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,073
the production of this lunar rover replica  

270
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,876
continues with the fabrication of a brake disk.        

271
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,680
the technician carefully measures the dimensions    

272
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,950
and draws them onto a sheet of plastic-covered aluminum.  

273
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,223
he drills a large hole     

274
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,193
for the main drive shaft and four screw holes.     

275
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,500
he then cuts out the disk,   

276
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,168
following the penciled lines. 

277
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,442
he smoothes the rough edges  
using a fine grit abrasive belt.

278
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,988
he sands off the plastic liner,

279
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,958
and abrades the aluminum surface
to a satiny sheen.       

280
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:52,270
the brake disk is now ready  
for assembly to the lunar rover.

281
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,009
he attaches it to the main drive shaft,    

282
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,211
and lowers the assembly into the vehicle.       

283
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,883
he bolts the disk to the chassis,        

284
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,819
where it will serve as a friction surface     

285
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,688
for the brake pads.      

286
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,423
he installs those next.    

287
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,564
he connects it to a spring mechanism     

288
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,166
for engaging the disk brake.  

289
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,371
he tests the drive shaft and disk brake         

290
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,607
and confirms that they're both in working order. 

291
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,315
he loops the roller chain around the sprocket gear    

292
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,850
for the rear wheel drive,   

293
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,186
and the teeth intermesh.    

294
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,988
he drives pins through the links

295
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,323
to join the ends, closing the loop.       

296
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:49,060
this drive chain is powered by an electric motor.     

297
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,463
it's another mechanical modification.         

298
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,931
on the original rover,     

299
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,000
there was a small motor for every wheel        

300
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,469
and no drive chain.      

301
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,704
the lawn-chair-like seats are next.           

302
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,010
they cover the shocks and battery at the front    

303
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,411
with an aluminum hood.     

304
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:16,421
they also install a cover over the mechanics at the back.

305
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,958
it doubles as a rack      
for geological excavation tools.

306
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,799
they attach the umbrella antenna
to the rover.         

307
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,502
it was used to beam pictures and data to earth.       

308
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,174
next, an aluminum cylinder spins in a lathe,       

309
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,177
as cutting tools transform it into a camera mount.      

310
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:48,119
they also create a bracket for a communications antenna. 

311
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,526
it's quite a transformation.  

312
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,465
using the bracket,       

313
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,736
a member of the crew now erects
the communications antenna.  

314
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,405
he then installs the mount for the film camera.      

315
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:13,812
next, using a sheer press,   

316
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,081
he lops off a piece of an aluminum sheet.     

317
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,622
he switches to a hand tool   

318
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,158
and cuts out a geometric shape with flaps.          

319
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,435
he folds up the flaps using a brake press,      

320
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,804
creating a box to cover the main battery.   

321
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,778
after the seams have been welded,       

322
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:51,549
he wraps the cover in mylar, which is a strong plastic film.

323
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,921
the wrap is an extra layer of protection         

324
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,625
against wind-borne particles, known as mircrometeoroids.   

325
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,529
they also wrap the camera   

326
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:06,564
and other parts of the rover with mylar.    

327
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,539
this replica of the apollo lunar rover   

328
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,041
is complete and ready for display.
