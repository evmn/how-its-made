00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,857
narrator: today on "how it's made"...   

4
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:56,121
together, the mortar and pestle form some of the oldest     

5
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,258
and most useful of humanity's inventions.    

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,328
their image adorns many pharmacology symbols    

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,729
because pharmacists have been  

8
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:06,799
using them to prepare medicine for centuries.          

9
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,801
but it's with food that this simple tool      

10
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,803
is most closely associated.   

11
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,674
the basic principle is simple enough --         

12
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,477
put the object you want to crush in a bowl,       

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,680
then take a stick and grind it down.        

14
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,216
but not all mortars and pestles are alike.            

15
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,618
for one thing,          

16
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,088
the material used can make all the difference.   

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,289
wooden and ceramics work well.  

18
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,559
but for many, nothing beats stone.       

19
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,496
granite provides a tough, non-porous surface.       

20
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,967
a craftsman prepares to carve.  

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,169
he starts by using a masonry compass        

22
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,239
and a liquid called chinese ink to draw the mortar's       

23
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,042
inner and outer circumference.  

24
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:54,046
he can easily remove the ink if there are any errors.     

25
00:01:56,317 --> 00:02:00,252
he roughs out the shape with a hammer and chisel.    

26
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,655
he then works with a grinder which is equipped        

27
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,591
with an extremely hard diamond-tipped blade,      

28
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,461
making it possible to cut through solid stone.   

29
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,298
once's he's defined the outside edge,        

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,601
he begins to work the inner bowl,         

31
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,638
carving out the perimeter before cutting a grid.      

32
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,144
he turns again to his hammers and chisels    

33
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:30,282
to remove material       
from the inside of the mortar.  

34
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,085
he uses the grinder to cut the last chunks      

35
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,687
and fine-tune the surface,    

36
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,491
giving it the smooth, consistent shape of a bowl.   

37
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,496
he uses a square to transfer a mark        

38
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,297
to the bottom of the stone.   

39
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,769
he marks the based with his compass.        

40
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,104
the circumference of the base  

41
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,507
must be slightly smaller than the top.          

42
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:03,449
he quickly roughs out the base with one of his chisels.     

43
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,317
then it's back to the grinder,  

44
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,453
which he uses to clean up the circumference        

45
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:11,057
and begin making a series of angle cuts into the sides.  

46
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,129
with hammer and chisel,     

47
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,931
he knocks off the pieces left between the angle cuts.   

48
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,903
thanks to years of experience, he makes it look easy.      

49
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,343
with the grinder, he works away at all of the surfaces,     

50
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,946
smoothing them to a consistent finish.     

51
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,484
one wrong move with this tool  

52
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:41,187
could mean being forced to start over,      

53
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,089
but this is a highly skilled artisan.    

54
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,491
more than 10 years of training  

55
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,159
make it possible for him to work         

56
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,095
with unhesitating speed and assurance,          

57
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,697
completing a finished mortar   

58
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,232
in less than an hour and a half.           

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,304
but, of course, there's something missing.    

60
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:02,641
a mortar isn't much good without a pestle.        

61
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,242
once again working with     

62
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,178
the confident swiftness of an expert,          

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,714
the artisan uses his grinder to hone a chunk of granite    

64
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,519
down to the shape of a well-balanced pestle.    

65
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,855
wide and blunt on one end    

66
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:19,191
and narrow enough to easily grasp on the other,  

67
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:22,328
the stone is perfectly calibrated to do its job.    

68
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,535
in the days before power tools,             

69
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,604
it would have taken a craftsman a full day      

70
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,807
to carve a mortar and pestle.  

71
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,945
but a carved mortar and pestle  

72
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,814
isn't necessarily a finished one.         

73
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,619
here, a painter adds the final touches.     

74
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,754
using a small brush and special varnish,       

75
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:53,359
he paints a lotus flower design on the lip of the mortar.    

76
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,694
he leaves the bowl itself untouched            

77
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,162
so that no food products     

78
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,331
will mix with the varnish when crushed.          

79
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,839
he then varnishes the exterior of the mortar.          

80
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:10,375
the varnishing process is purely decorative.      

81
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,911
hard stone like granite needs no protective coating   

82
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,713
to help it endure.        

83
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,684
after all, some granite has been around for millions of years.  

84
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:26,124
it takes just 15 to 20 minutes for the varnish to dry.     

85
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,396
and with that, the mortar is completely finished.     

86
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:34,199
the lotus flower design isn't the only one available.  

87
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,268
this facility produces a wide range      

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,138
of mortars and pestles.     

89
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,740
these mortars and pestles may be attractive.        

90
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,410
but their appearance is secondary to their function.            

91
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,880
there are few tools in a kitchen more durable or more useful   

92
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,950
than a good mortar and pestle.  

93
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,499
narrator: in the early days of bowling,  

94
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,769
shellac-based conditioners were applied to wooden lanes   

95
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,438
to protect the surface.     

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,107
today, robotic machines apply conditioners        

97
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:19,044
in different patterns to mainly synthetic lanes,    

98
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,979
easier ones for the average bowler      

99
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,883
and more challenging ones for tournament players.     

100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,788
at most bowling alleys, lane cleaning and condition   

101
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,959
are done automatically by roaming robots.        

102
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,194
they apply different conditioners      

103
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,930
in specific patterns.      

104
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:42,134
the pattern selections     
are made by league organizers.  

105
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:47,139
it's all about ensuring consistent scoring.       

106
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,074
computerized tools with different bits       

107
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,677
produce many of the robot's parts.      

108
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,346
here, they carve a block of aluminum into a mounting part              

109
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,682
for a handle.          

110
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,852
this is the blank before and after.            

111
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,155
an employee assembles two of the mounting parts    

112
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,026
to a handle.           

113
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:09,361
he secures them with heavy duty bolts,      

114
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,629
ensuring that these pressure points will hold up       

115
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,035
to the job of lifting      
the 370-pound robotic machine.  

116
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,775
he attaches one handle to each of the two side panels.             

117
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,843
he installs a sprocket sensor system          

118
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,713
on one of the side panels.    

119
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,381
this sprocket sensor will detect             

120
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,383
where the robot is and communicate        

121
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:35,120
that information to is computer.            

122
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,790
he links it to the front wheel with a second sprocket chain,  

123
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,827
and closes the loop with a master link.       

124
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,134
he now lowers the oil buffer brush assembly into the machine.            

125
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,605
he inserts the main drive more  

126
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,474
and then secures it to an aluminum partition     

127
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,911
with the shaft protruding through the other side.     

128
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,016
he then wraps the drive chain  

129
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:08,020
around the sprockets of the shaft.          

130
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,689
he loops a rubber belt in front of the buffer brush   

131
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,225
and connects it to the oil applicator.      

132
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,095
the applicator will slide on the belt,     

133
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,864
dispensing small amounts of conditioner.         

134
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,703
he installs whisker sensors to the front on each side.    

135
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,305
when these whiskers brush the sides of the lane,   

136
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,708
they'll send a signal to the computer,         

137
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,579
which will then direct the robot to move more to the center.   

138
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,848
the conditioning solution tanks have been equipped        

139
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,317
with metering pumps and pressure gauges.       

140
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,988
he bolts the assembly to the rear wall of the machine.            

141
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,390
he pops in the rechargeable battery     

142
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,658
and connects it to the motor.  

143
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,796
the machine is ready for the computerized system   

144
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,464
that runs it.          

145
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,601
this system includes the control panel.        

146
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,536
he installs it in the center of the machine,         

147
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,304
just above the battery.     

148
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:04,009
he then runs the hose from the conditioning tank    

149
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:08,680
over to the applicator and connects it.         

150
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,548
moving to the front,       

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,219
another employee unwinds fabric from one roller and attaches   

152
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,687
the end to the next.       

153
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,423
this is part of the cleaning system.     

154
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,291
the cloth will scrub the bowling lane         

155
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,430
after the robot sprays a cleaning solution onto it.   

156
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,899
a suctioning squeegee will vacuum up dirt       

157
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,500
and leftover cleaner       

158
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,637
and deposit them in this recovery tank.      

159
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,371
he then plugs the wiring harness             

160
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,442
into the computer at the back of the control panel.      

161
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,313
it's time for a dry run.     

162
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,982
with no cleaner or conditioner in the system yet,        

163
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,185
the technician powers up the robot           

164
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,453
and puts it through its paces.  

165
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,590
he confirms that every part is in good working order.    

166
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,993
he adds cleaning solution to the tank,           

167
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:59,865
and it's time prepare the lane conditioners.      

168
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,333
they mix the mineral oil-based conditioners      

169
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,002
in big blenders.         

170
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,737
there are nine different recipes,             

171
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,540
with up to 16 ingredients in each one.           

172
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,146
they test each mixture extensively.           

173
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,682
they measure the viscosity because it can affect      

174
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,618
how the conditioner flows on the lane.           

175
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,753
and they evaluate the surface tension.       

176
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:25,891
that's its ability to bond to the lane.       

177
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,628
with the conditioners approved, it's time to test the robot   

178
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,097
in special quality control lanes.          

179
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,500
during 50 trips down the lanes,         

180
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:37,636
a technician evaluates the robot's performance.     

181
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,706
he inspects its turning radius  

182
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,176
and the effectiveness of the sensors.         

183
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:49,714
he also scrutinizes the cleaning and conditioning job.      

184
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,850
satisfied that the conditioning robot   

185
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:56,922
works well on its own, he approves it for shipping.   

186
00:10:56,924 --> 00:11:00,458
this bowling lane conditioner should be a real game changer  

187
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,530
and ensure that the path to victory is a well-oiled one.              

188
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,284
narrator: a crematory is a machine     

189
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,487
used to cremate bodies swiftly and safely.       

190
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,355
even though the cremated remains             

191
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,224
are commonly referred to as ashes,      

192
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,760
they're actually bone fragments.           

193
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,095
the family may choose to inter them,          

194
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,563
preserve them in an urn,     

195
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,768
or scatter them in a meaningful place.      

196
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,171
this pet crematory has three small chambers.    

197
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,574
the human version has a single chamber       

198
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,309
large enough to accommodate a casket.     

199
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:55,447
inside, flames from a gas burner engulf the deceased,       

200
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,182
and the burning body releases fluids and gases    

201
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,119
which flow to a secondary chamber in the back,              

202
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,456
where another burner incinerates them.        

203
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,527
the crematory's frame is made  
of ultra-strong tubular steel,  

204
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:09,861
because the structure      

205
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,131
must withstand expansion and contraction,         

206
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,800
as the chamber heats up     

207
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,537
to more than 1,800 degrees fahrenheit during cremation,   

208
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,572
then cools down afterward.    

209
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,345
once workers have cut steel tubing to the lengths required,            

210
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,413
they place the pieces in a jig,              

211
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,550
which configures them correctly for assembly.          

212
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,889
after ensuring the tubes are flush,       

213
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,158
workers clamp them to the jig  

214
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,394
to prevent them from shifting out of position.         

215
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,567
then they weld the tubes together,            

216
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,102
assembling then connecting    

217
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,438
the multiple sections of the frame.          

218
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,314
next, thick sheets of steel   

219
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,217
for the crematory's floor and walls.            

220
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,988
workers clamp the sheets in position,           

221
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,523
then fuse them to the frame   

222
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,993
with just over 5-inch long welds on the outside          

223
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,529
and full-length welds along the inside seams      

224
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,666
to completely seal the unit.   

225
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:23,802
they weld steel airlines for oxygenating the the fire   

226
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,570
in the chambers.         

227
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,342
now, workers begin insulating the chambers     

228
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:34,012
to shield the steel structure from the intense heat.      

229
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,414
first, they apply adhesive-backed steel pins    

230
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,550
to the steel walls        

231
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,352
and affix insulation boards   

232
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:43,322
made of heat-resistant ceramic fibers.         

233
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,861
they secure the boards to the pins with steel disks.  

234
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:57,969
workers nail in a second layer of insulation.          

235
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,372
these stiffer boards are made of a higher concentration    

236
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,306
of ceramic fibers,        

237
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,775
making them even more heat resistant     

238
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,544
than the first layer.      

239
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,990
after insulating the top of the machine the same way,   

240
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,527
they install an exhaust chimney above the secondary chamber,   

241
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,264
then a motorized fan that blows air through a long shaft.             

242
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,069
the shaft functions as an air supply highway,    

243
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,338
with exit pipes going to the airlines      

244
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,609
and to the gas burners in the chambers.         

245
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,211
workers apply two coats of high temperature paint    

246
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,714
to the machine's steel exterior.            

247
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,483
and then it's time to line the chambers       

248
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:50,288
with a third and final layer of insulation.          

249
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,892
this insulation material is refractory brick.       

250
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,962
the term "refractory" means "heat resistant."     

251
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,296
the bricks are made       

252
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,032
of a ceramic material called alumina silica,      

253
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,434
and can withstand temperatures  

254
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:06,971
as high as 2,900 degrees, fahrenheit.  

255
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:10,308
the three layers of insulation absorb the intense heat     

256
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,910
of the cremation process,    

257
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,912
which can take 1 to 2 hours,   

258
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,448
depending on the weight of the body.           

259
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,984
they protect the machine's steel structure         

260
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,586
so that it doesn't degrade and weaken.       

261
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:28,794
once the mortar dries, workers pour the floor and ceiling,   

262
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,195
then hang the machine's steel door,    

263
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,131
which operates on a hydraulically powered     

264
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,400
chain and sprocket.       

265
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:39,137
the door is lined with insulated refractory brick,             

266
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,739
which, unlike the chamber brick,             

267
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:43,875
reflects rather than absorbs heat.          

268
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:48,946
this prevents the door from getting too hot to handle.             

269
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,683
the final step is to wire the chamber heat sensors     

270
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:55,420
and other electronics to the electrical panel.     

271
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,290
the cremation is automated.   

272
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,958
some machines have gauges and indicator lights       

273
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,761
which enable the operator to monitor combustion      

274
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:07,699
and adjust fuel and airflow as required.           

275
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,167
other machines have a computer,            

276
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,035
which runs, monitors,      

277
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,972
and regulates the process from start to finish.      

278
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,310
the crematory incinerates all but 5% of the body.     

279
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,313
what remains are bone fragments,           

280
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,381
which are then ground into a powder          

281
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,384
and returned in a container to the family.          

282
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:44,068
narrator: computer game systems may be the rage,         

283
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,005
but kids still love to play the old fashioned way --     

284
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,341
outside, in the fresh air, on a playset.          

285
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,744
and today's playsets are quite often elaborate,    

286
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:56,480
with a slew of apparatuses that provide a lot more exercise            

287
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,350
than a game controller does.   

288
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,421
many playsets are modular systems,       

289
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,089
which let you choose the components          

290
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,225
and configuration.        

291
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,695
this set combines forts, ladders, monkey bars,      

292
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,496
a climbing wall, swings,     

293
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,433
rope, and a slide.        

294
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,768
the wood is redwood,       

295
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,036
a species that's safe for little hands         

296
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,706
because it's splinter-free.   

297
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,975
it's also naturally weather resistant,        

298
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,444
so it doesn't need to be treated with chemicals   

299
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,646
to prevent rotting.       

300
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,049
workers first cut out any knots and defects.      

301
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,516
then they saw the wood      

302
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:37,055
to the lengths required for different parts.       

303
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,856
they load several of the same part         

304
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,659
onto a computer-guided router.  

305
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,797
these are the sides for several ladder kits.     

306
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,467
the router cuts slots for the ladder's wooden steps  

307
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,070
and drills holes for the bolts that attach the ladders     

308
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,939
to their respective playset.   

309
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,211
worker's manually sand every piece of wood       

310
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,879
that goes into a playset     

311
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,481
so that the entire surface is smooth            

312
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,383
for little hands and knees.   

313
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,289
when pieces need to be shaped a certain way,          

314
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,491
workers run them through this machine.          

315
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,760
it's called a wood molder.    

316
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,897
inside, it has four spindles with rotary knives        

317
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,966
that trim the wood on all sides           

318
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,767
to specific pre-set dimensions  

319
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,236
and shape.            

320
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,440
a wood molder can make relatively complex cuts     

321
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,309
to make decorative crown moldings.    

322
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,178
however, for these playsets,   

323
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,114
the molder primarily curves edges           

324
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,382
and shapes adjoining components           

325
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,751
to fit together like puzzle pieces.       

326
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,389
here's what a piece looks like before and after         

327
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,659
it's put through the wood molder for sizing            

328
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,862
and to round the corners.    

329
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:55,800
several wood components also go through this piece of equipment,           

330
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,870
called the double-end cut-off machine.         

331
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,471
as the name implies,       

332
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,541
it saws off a preset amount of wood on each end       

333
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,544
to standardize length and smooth the surface.     

334
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:12,117
the playset's structure has angled braces in the corners             

335
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,086
for extra reinforcement.     

336
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,889
to make these braces, workers notch the wood pieces      

337
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,357
on this machine.         

338
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,158
then they round the edges with a router          

339
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,794
and sand the surface.      

340
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,632
once all the wood parts     
are shaped and sanded, workers  

341
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,502
put them on a conveyor belt,   

342
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,903
which ferries them through a machine        

343
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,706
called a vacuum coater.     

344
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,442
it saturates the part with a non-toxic,        

345
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,577
water-based reddish stain,    

346
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,381
then suctions off the excess.  

347
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,818
workers staple an identification label on every part.       

348
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,857
then they bundle together all the parts for the module --               

349
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,192
this is the ladder kit --    

350
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,195
and put them through a plastic banding machine    

351
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,464
to tie them together.      

352
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,867
the bander works by feeding a continuous plastic strap    

353
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,536
off a spool.           

354
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,739
when the operator steps on a foot pedal,         

355
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,674
the machine shoots the strap tightly around the bundle,    

356
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,344
then cuts and heat seals the ends.            

357
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,749
swing, slides, and climbing wall footings    

358
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,884
are made of molded polyethylene,          

359
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,620
a flexible and durable type of plastic.   

360
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:29,160
to assemble this baby swing, workers bend it to shape     

361
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,563
and clamp it in an assembly fixture.     

362
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,899
then, one side at a time,    

363
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,702
they position the galvanized steel hardware  

364
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,904
and insert the rivets that will fasten it.       

365
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,110
they transfer this assembly to a vice,            

366
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:49,647
then drive in the rivets with an air-powered impact gun.              

367
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:56,921
the swing hangs on plastic-coated steel chains.   

368
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:01,459
this module is what they call the split ladder.        

369
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,128
it combines a wood step ladder  

370
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,997
with a more challenging chain ladder.          

371
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,266
plastic-coated steel pipes    

372
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,070
at the top and bottom link the two.     

373
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,272
the galvanized steel chain ladder is coated with plastic  

374
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,609
to make it softer to the touch.             

375
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,881
they complete the unit with a wooden side rail,     

376
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,951
then place the split ladder on a large vertical press,    

377
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,687
which forces the parts tightly together.        

378
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,625
the unit will be further secured with bolts,   

379
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,161
once assembled to the playset,  

380
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,563
along with a selection of additional climbing,       

381
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,433
dangling, sliding, and swinging options       

382
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,836
for active little monkeys.
