narrator: cars that don't have fuel-injection systems     

4
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,321
have carburetors.       

5
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:57,256
they're an integral part of the engine         

6
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,393
that mixes air and fuel in specific proportions,    

7
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:04,130
vaporizes them, then sends the mixture to the intake manifold.

8
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,399
the manifold transfers the mixture     

9
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,902
to the engine cylinders, where combustion occurs.    

10
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,676
filtered air enters the carburetor         

11
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:17,677
and mixes with fuel.      

12
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,878
when you press the gas,    

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,614
the carburetor opens conduits 

14
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:24,349
for the air-and-fuel mixture to flow to the engine.     

15
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,486
two metering blocks control the proportion of fuel to air. 

16
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:32,158
computer-guided precision tools
machine them out of aluminum. 

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,228
meanwhile, workers install components called boosters   

18
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,364
in the carburetor's main body. 

19
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:42,435
these boosters spray the fuel-and-air mixture as a mist 

20
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,371
into tapered conduits called venturi.        

21
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,773
those lead to the intake manifold,    

22
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,378
which transfers the mixture to the engine's cylinders.   

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,246
another computerized machine  

24
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,449
makes each throttle shaft from a bar of steel.      

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,519
these shafts turn when you press on the gas,   

26
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,387
pivoting the butterfly discs  

27
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,124
that open those conduits to the intake manifold.     

28
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,326
the tooling machine bores screw holes       

29
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,061
for attaching the butterflies 

30
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:13,199
and carves grooves to prevent fuel from leaking out.     

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,880
workers install the throttle shafts      

32
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,682
in the carburetor's baseplate. 

33
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,885
one side of this plate will bolt to the main body   

34
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,755
and the other to the intake manifold.    

35
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:39,692
the butterflies are made of aluminum, steel, or brass, 

36
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,328
depending on the carburetor model.    

37
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:50,102
he flips the baseplate and flares the bottom of the screws

38
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:52,437
to prevent them from vibrating out       

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,106
and falling into the engine.  

40
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,308
after installing an adjustment screw      

41
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,511
for tuning the carburetor and using thread-locking fluid 

42
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,513
to ensure the components don't loosen,         

43
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,384
it's time to assemble the levers
that turn the throttle shafts. 

44
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:18,664
a washer and cotter pin hold it all together.     

45
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,204
a few pulls on the levers   

46
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,808
ensure that both throttle shafts
move freely and smoothly,   

47
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,008
turning the butterflies    

48
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,943
perpendicular to open the conduits      

49
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,212
and flat to close them.    

50
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,748
next, the accelerator pump arm --          

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,285
it shoots an initial burst of fuel when you start the car.

52
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,821
the carburetor's cast-metal fuel bowls     

53
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,490
go into a vibrating tumbler  

54
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,092
where metal balls smooth their surface.     

55
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,129
then they receive a protective coating.     

56
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,100
now a worker installs a float 

57
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,236
to control the fuel level inside each bowl.       

58
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,372
this is essential because too little fuel    

59
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,641
would prevent engine start-up, 

60
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,111
and too much fuel would overflow
and cause a shutdown.     

61
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,848
a gasket sandwiched between the main body and the baseplate

62
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,318
will prevent fuel from leaking out and dirt from seeping in.  

63
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,788
as a precaution, they coat the baseplate screws      

64
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,959
with thread-locking fluid so they won't loosen over time.

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,799
now the baseplate that contains

66
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,667
the throttle shafts and butterflies        

67
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,939
is connected to the main body that contains the boosters.  

68
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,342
next come the metering blocks --

69
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:40,045
a gasket over each one, and then into a fuel bowl.   

70
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,017
then one block-and-bowl unit  

71
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,220
goes on each side of the main body.       

72
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,428
just one final adjustment   

73
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,897
to the accelerator pump lever and arm            

74
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,433
and the carburetor is finished.

75
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,846
in the quality-control department,          

76
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,848
every carburetor undergoes testing       

77
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,717
with fluids similar to gasoline.

78
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,786
they check if the accelerator pump    

79
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,788
squirts out enough fuel at ignition          

80
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,858
and during the transition from idling mode to acceleration.  

81
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,262
then, once everything's running
at regular speed,       

82
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:34,667
they measure the amount of fluid
the boosters spray per hour.  

83
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,869
once they pass quality control,

84
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:41,040
these carburetors will really be able to rev you up. 

85
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,489
narrator: in an air conditioner,     

86
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,491
liquid refrigerant absorbs heat
from inside the building,   

87
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,828
changes into a gas, then flows outdoors.      

88
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,031
it goes through a compressor, then a heat-exchanger coil   

89
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,567
that transfers the heat to the outside air,      

90
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,036
turning the refrigerant gas to liquid again.        

91
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,106
the refrigerant then circulates
back inside the building.   

92
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,111
this air-conditioner company  

93
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,380
makes its coils entirely of aluminum,     

94
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,916
which is five times more corrosion-resistant    

95
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,319
than coils made of copper and aluminum.         

96
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,388
to make the coil,       

97
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,858
workers position an aluminum tube called the spine     

98
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,061
in the middle         
of this special winding machine.

99
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,865
then they feed in an aluminum strip.       

100
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,468
the machine slits the aluminum strip    

101
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,304
into thin teeth called fins.  

102
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,012
then it folds and wraps    
thousands upon thousands of fins

103
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,347
around the spine,       

104
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,817
making the material they call spine fin tubing.  

105
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,955
each tiny fin is a heat-transfer vehicle.  

106
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,900
now to form the coil.     

107
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,503
they hook the end of the spine fin tubing    

108
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,506
to an automated winder.    

109
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:26,045
it spirals the spine fin tubing
into a large cylindrical shape.

110
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,923
when they finish winding the coil,           

111
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,326
they cut the end free from the feeder,        

112
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:44,163
then apply hot glue to hold everything together.  

113
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,807
the next machine presses the coil on all sides     

114
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:58,210
to form it into the shape of the air conditioner.    

115
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,150
a worker now cuts into the coil
and bears a row of tubing.   

116
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,352
these cuts determine the circuits,         

117
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,755
the term for the path the refrigerant takes     

118
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,092
as it flows through the coil. 

119
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:16,294
the pipes that feed these circuits are made of copper,  

120
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,097
but copper doesn't fuse directly to aluminum.     

121
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,034
so workers must first solder on
transition tubes        

122
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:24,236
coated with a zinc/aluminum alloy.     

123
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,038
then they attach the copper manifolds      

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,209
that distribute the refrigerant
to the circuits.        

125
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,251
once all the refrigeration components are in place,    

126
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,988
workers subject the coil unit to an underwater pressure test 

127
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,625
to make sure there are no leaks.

128
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,798
in another department, workers have assembled     

129
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,234
the air conditioner's compressor.          

130
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,742
they mount the compressor to a weather-resistant plastic base,

131
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,145
then cover it with a sound reducer,     

132
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,815
a vinyl jacket filled with fiberglass insulation.  

133
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,553
now they add the coil.     

134
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,225
it sits between posts in the base.          

135
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,694
for an air conditioner to work well,         

136
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,432
it can't have air or moisture in its refrigeration system.  

137
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,234
so workers hook up the unit to automated machinery     

138
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,004
that completely evacuates the lines.           

139
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,643
next, workers connect wiring and install corner supports,  

140
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:43,048
then begin assembling the unit's exterior housing.  

141
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,317
the top perimeter piece is shaped           

142
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,786
to direct the airflow out of the unit.        

143
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,322
a motorized fan pulls air into the unit.    

144
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,524
a plastic grille lets air exit 

145
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,528
and keeps debris from falling inside.      

146
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,331
finally, they seal the refrigerant lines     

147
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,767
by brazing shut a pair of tubes.

148
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,280
the housing parts are made of zinc-coated steel.     

149
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,015
the factory spray-paints them 

150
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,519
then bakes the paint for maximum durability.    

151
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,424
air conditioners sit outdoors 

152
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:28,827
so they have to withstand all kinds of weather.     

153
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,896
the factory sends sample units 

154
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,765
to a performance-testing laboratory.          

155
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,969
it runs them in extreme heat, extreme cold, rain, and snow  

156
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,972
to see if, under such harsh conditions,  

157
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,342
they keep their cool.     

158
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,327
narrator: next time you reach for the sugar bowl,      

159
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,262
try to imagine that it was once
so rare and expensive     

160
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,797
it was called white gold.   

161
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,066
producing sugar from the sugarcane       

162
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,601
first took place in india.   

163
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,802
about 300 b.c.,        

164
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,006
alexander the great's army reported seeing a reed     

165
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,808
that gives honey without bees growing there.         

166
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:23,748
this table sugar has many names --       

167
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,818
mill white, plantation white, and crystal sugar.       

168
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,288
but it all comes from the sugarcane.      

169
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,423
it looks a lot like bamboo with fully grown stalks    

170
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,893
that can measure up to 20 feet high.      

171
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,230
here in the field,       

172
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,566
a worker pares away the husk from a stalk of sugarcane,   

173
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,636
then chews the cane's raw pulp 

174
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,106
to extract the stalk's sweet juice.    

175
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:51,577
this machine harvests the cane by cutting it at the base.   

176
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:59,050
rotating scrolls feed the cane to the chopper drums inside.  

177
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,119
as they chop the cane,     

178
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,324
a fan blows the lighter leaves and tops back onto the field.  

179
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,132
the heavier lengths of cane drop
into the base of a conveyor,  

180
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,668
which feeds them into the transport bin     

181
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,770
that follows alongside.    

182
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,212
trucks rapidly transport the cut cane          

183
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,481
to the sugar mill for processing.        

184
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,617
once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content,   

185
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,553
and damage to the cane during harvesting       

186
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,956
accelerates this decay.    

187
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,094
at the mill, trucks empty their
load onto a receiving table.  

188
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,163
it feeds a belt conveyor    

189
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:49,768
that takes the cane through two separate washes.  

190
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,104
the cane must be as clean as possible      

191
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,507
before extracting the juice.  

192
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,248
but first, the cane's hard structure is broken down 

193
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,782
inside this crusher,      

194
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,853
where rotating hammers break the cane into small pieces.   

195
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,923
a conveyor loads it into a milling tandem     

196
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,260
designed to extract the sweet juice from the crushed cane.  

197
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:23,335
in this milling tandem,    
the cane passes through a series

198
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,937
of five or more consecutive mills.       

199
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,007
large cylinders compress the cane fiber.        

200
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,077
the juice pours out of the milling tandem     

201
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,614
and diverts into a channel away from the bagasse,     

202
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,784
the dry pulp that remains after extracting the juice.  

203
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,495
a worker supervises the operation at each of the mills.

204
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,430
a vat collects the juice    

205
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,701
that flows from the top and bottom of the mills.    

206
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,840
now that the juice is extracted
from the sugarcane,      

207
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,375
it's time to process it.    

208
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:06,845
however, before turning the juice into sugar crystals, 

209
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,380
a sample goes through a series of tests       

210
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,383
at the sugar mill's laboratory.

211
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,051
first, a technician adds a thickener        

212
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,722
that binds to impurities in the juice          

213
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:20,192
and then filters it to obtain a clear, clean juice.     

214
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,861
then he pours it into a polarimeter,      

215
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,431
a machine that measures the concentration of sugar.  

216
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,868
the juice from the mills    

217
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,672
now falls through this 33-foot-high tower    

218
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:36,607
as sulfur-dioxide vapors rise through it.        

219
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,143
this process, known as sulfitation,     

220
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,812
bleaches the juice.      

221
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,346
then the juice flows      

222
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,250
through a device that measures its p.h. level. 

223
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,720
while at a separate vat,    

224
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,155
workers add powdered lime to water,           

225
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,860
preparing a solution to which they will then add the juice. 

226
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:01,366
an agitator mixes the cane-juice-and-lime solution  

227
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:07,239
for about six hours to complete
a process called alkalization. 

228
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:12,711
it regulates the juice's    
p.h. level and helps clarify it.

229
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,446
in reaction to the lime,    

230
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:17,949
the juice's color changes from brown to yellow.     

231
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,657
next, the juice goes into these clarifier tanks.     

232
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,127
it takes over two hours for the juice to settle    

233
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,464
and for the impurities to fall to the bottom of the tank.   

234
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,065
a sample taken from the tank  

235
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,601
shows how the sludge collects at the bottom,    

236
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,337
while the clarified juice collects at the top.      

237
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,474
next, we'll see how this clarified juice    

238
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,944
transforms into flowing crystals
of white sugar.        

239
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,630
narrator: christopher columbus never made it to asia     

240
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,698
but discovered the caribbean  

241
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,167
and later brought sugarcane plantings there.   

242
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,701
sugarcane provides sugar    

243
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,438
but also syrup, molasses, rum, and ethanol.          

244
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,241
the many types of sugar available in stores      

245
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,176
differ in crystal size or color,

246
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,846
depending on how they are processed.    

247
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,387
workers filter the residue known as mud    

248
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,657
from the clarifier tanks to extract any remaining sugar.

249
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,263
there's no waste here.     

250
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,032
the mud will fertilize the cane fields,        

251
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:45,470
and the bagasse will be burned as fuel.    

252
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,673
the clarified juice collected from the clarifier tanks    

253
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,743
now boils in a series of evaporators.  

254
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,679
this brings the concentration of the sugar and the juice   

255
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,282
up from 15% to 60%.      

256
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,620
then the juice collects in 15-ton tanks        

257
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:03,020
to clarify even more.     

258
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,958
any sediment left in the juice floats to the top.       

259
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,094
a rotating paddle skims this residue off     

260
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,930
to the sides of the tank.   

261
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,836
these tanks produce a type of syrup    

262
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,173
that goes on for still more processing.   

263
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,777
workers now pour        

264
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,813
microscopic sucrose crystals suspended in alcohol      

265
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,247
into the syrup.        

266
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,519
this milky solution binds to the sugar present in the syrup 

267
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,787
and helps draw it out.     

268
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,058
next, it all boils in large vacuum pans,     

269
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,994
forming sugar crystals.    

270
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,530
as the water in the syrup boils away,          

271
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:50,401
workers regularly check to see how the sugar is crystallizing.

272
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,071
the goal -- to produce a thick,

273
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,807
crystallized paste known as mesquite.       

274
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:02,146
it then goes into       
a high-speed centrifugal machine

275
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:06,151
to remove the sugar crystals from the uncrystallized syrup. 

276
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:11,022
inside, the sugar spins    
at 1,200 revolutions per minute.

277
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,224
this action draws the molasses 

278
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,893
to the outer shell of the machine,        

279
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:19,030
while the crystals remain in the inner basket.      

280
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,109
sprays of water wash the crystals,       

281
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,580
then the water is drawn out so that only the crystals remain. 

282
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,582
this centrifuge works much the same way    

283
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,452
as a washing machine set on the spin cycle.     

284
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,788
it draws out moisture from the sugar         

285
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,258
much like you draw out the wash
water from a load of laundry. 

286
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,542
next, a conveyor belt carries the sugar crystals   

287
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,111
out of the centrifuge.     

288
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,481
this mill produces raw sugar, 

289
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,152
which has a higher molasses color and is unbleached,    

290
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,087
and plantation white sugar,  

291
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,758
which has less molasses and is bleached a brilliant white. 

292
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,298
the sugar on the conveyor now goes into a large dryer.  

293
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,834
hot air blows into this dryer 

294
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,837
to bring the sugar's humidity level down to .02%.  

295
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,875
that's standard for table sugar.

296
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:46,050
the dried sugar pours out from 
the dryer into a bag on a scale.

297
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:50,221
it's full when it weighs in at 2,200 pounds.        

298
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,330
a hoist then carries the bags to a platform         

299
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,133
at the far end of the packing facility.    

300
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:05,770
at 3.3 tons, that's a heavy load.      

301
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,076
it lowers each bag over a chute

302
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,411
that leads to the factory's main floor.   

303
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,682
workers carefully open each bag in turn        

304
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,586
and pour out the sugar directly into the chute.    

305
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,023
it feeds an automated packaging machine,

306
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,961
which fills a series of 4½-pound plastic bags,   

307
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,230
seals them, and separates them.

308
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,034
this packing facility produces 200,000 bags a day.  

309
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:40,772
that means processing 400 tons of white sugar daily.     

310
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,110
this fine plantation-white sugar

311
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:50,381
is available in a variety   
of convenient packaging options,

312
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:54,486
and that should sweeten anyone's day.         

313
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,129
