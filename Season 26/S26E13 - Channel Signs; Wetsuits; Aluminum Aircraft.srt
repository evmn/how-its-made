2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,673
      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,255
   narrator: a channel sign is  
              made              
     of individual letters      

4
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,357
         that are fixed         
  to a building or backdrop.    

5
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,462
   the letters have internal    
   channels that house either   
              neon              

6
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,864
        or led lights.          

7
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:07,933
 at night, the channel letters  

8
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,535
            light up            
  and make a bold statement.    

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,476
        channel letters         
     are three-dimensional      

10
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,378
      and really stand out      
        from the rest.          

11
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,149
     the illuminated signs      
    grab people's attention     

12
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,519
        and convert them        
   into potential customers.    

13
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,023
        channel letters         
    are made from acrylic.      

14
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,759
 the factory uses colored vinyl 
         to tint them.          

15
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,097
  an employee peels the liner   
        from the vinyl,         

16
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,066
exposing the adhesive backing.  

17
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,235
       he uses a roller         

18
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,372
 to apply the vinyl to one side 
     of the clear acrylic.      

19
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,974
         the other side         
     of the acrylic sheet       

20
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:49,575
is covered with a paper liner.  

21
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,449
   a computerized router cuts   
 the letters out on that side.  

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,624
    the font style and size     
     are custom-made for the    
            client.             

23
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,263
 after the letters are cut out, 
they remove the paper backing.  

24
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,869
    the employees use nails     

25
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,038
  to hold the letters in place  
         as they work.          

26
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,946
           the worker           
   unrolls plastic trim cap     

27
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:28,581
          and cuts it           
   to fit around the letter.    

28
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,756
 he lines the letter with trim  

29
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:39,659
   and hammers in more nails,   
 to keep everything in place.   

30
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,335
   he makes cuts to the trim    
     to form neat corners.      

31
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,043
 the trim cap gives the letter  
       a finished look.         

32
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,846
   it also creates a surface    
         for attaching          

33
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,382
   the back letter enclosure,   
    called the letter can.      

34
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,659
       he seals the trim        
   around the entire length     

35
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,928
   with high-strength glue.     

36
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,331
         once it dries,         
     he removes the nails.      

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,666
        now, it's ready         
      for the letter can.       

38
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,736
       to make the sides        
      of the letter can,        

39
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:25,538
     they feed a wide strip     
          of aluminum           

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,540
 into a computerized machine.   

41
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,581
     it bends the aluminum      
    to match the face of the    
            letter.             

42
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,885
      it also forms a lip       
        at the bottom,          

43
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,887
       to attach the can        
       to the back wall.        

44
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,898
    the side of each channel    
             letter             
     is called the return.      

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,267
  it attaches the letter face   
       to the back wall.        

46
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,906
        the return also         
      creates the channel       

47
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,542
    which holds the lighting    
 and directs the illumination.  

48
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,885
       these are the dies       
     that cut and shape the     
           aluminum.            

49
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,925
 using a computerized machine,  
      it takes the worker       

50
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,662
    a few minutes to create     
  the channel letter return.    

51
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,130
    it would take four times    
             longer             

52
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,932
   to make the letter return    
           by hand.             

53
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,605
      here is a completed       
     channel letter return      

54
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,440
with the ends welded together.  

55
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,814
  an employee slides the side   
 structure over the back wall   

56
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,115
    to form the letter can.     

57
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,054
    he checks the fit, then     
    clinches the back to the    
            return.             

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,626
         this completes         
    the channel letter can.     

59
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:04,503
      they run led lights       
      throughout the can.       

60
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:08,574
  in recent years, led lights   
   have replaced neon tubes     

61
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,676
     because they are more      
       energy-efficient.        

62
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,114
     an employee paints the     
            aluminum            
    can to match the vinyl      

63
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,349
on the letter's acrylic front.  

64
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,728
     they test the lights.      

65
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,263
 if they work, the technicians  

66
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,599
      mount the letter can      
     to the sign backdrop.      

67
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,336
     the installer attaches     
 the translucent acrylic face   

68
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,604
          to the can.           

69
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,610
     it takes about an hour     
  to make one channel letter    

70
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:49,348
      and a couple of days      
    to make an entire channel   
             sign.              

71
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,051
       the final product        
    is sure to be noticed.      

72
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,836
    the wetsuit was invented    
   in the mid-20th century.     

73
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,240
            however,            
  it wasn't an immediate hit.   

74
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,775
   made of a synthetic rubber   
       called neoprene,         

75
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,977
      the early wetsuits        

76
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,645
      were hard to put on       
    and irritated the skin.     

77
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,581
       but recent neoprene      
          improvements          
     have made the wetsuit      

78
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,352
      a popular choice for      
           protection           
     against the elements.      

79
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,991
    when the surf is up, but    
the water temperature is down,  

80
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,662
       a neoprene wetsuit       
     is a practical swimwear    
            choice.             

81
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,131
         even when wet,         
    it keeps the body warm.     

82
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,868
   wetsuits fit like a second   
             skin,              

83
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,439
   so many surfers and divers   
   have theirs custom-made.     

84
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,812
 the tailor measures the client 
 from the neck to the ankles.   

85
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,014
        the suit allows         
    a small amount of water     

86
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,018
   to seep between it and the   
             skin.              

87
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,921
   body heat warms the water,   
    insulating the swimmer.     

88
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:09,361
 using the measurements, a team 
 cuts out cardboard patterns.   

89
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:13,432
     then, a worker uses the    
             patters            
  to cut the neoprene pieces.   

90
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,833
       they use neoprene        

91
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:19,104
 because its cellular structure 
     is a good insulator.       

92
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,240
      the number of pieces      
     in each suit varies,       

93
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,775
     according to the style     
           and size.            

94
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:28,580
    each suit has at least 15   
             pieces             
  and can have as much as 30.   

95
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,317
 fabric for the wetsuits comes  
    in a variety of colors.     

96
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,986
    some fabric will be used    
      for accent panels,        

97
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:39,191
          while others          
      create the structural     
           elements.            

98
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:44,195
    the pieces fit together     
     like a jigsaw puzzle.      

99
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,599
    a worker heats one of the   
             panels             
       with a hot press.        

100
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,135
     this slightly expands      
         the neoprene.          

101
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,139
    he places a decal of the    
             company            
      logo on the panel.        

102
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:58,209
   he lowers the press again    
to fuse the logo to the panel.  

103
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,945
    as the neoprene cools,      

104
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,213
   it shrinks to its original   
             size,              

105
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,950
      making the lettering      
     less likely to crack.      

106
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,156
     next, a worker applies     
  waterproof rubberized glue    

107
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,625
          to the edges          
    of the neoprene panels.     

108
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,563
    this is one of the most     
        important parts         

109
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,033
of the wetsuit's construction.  

110
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:24,502
  too little glue could affect  
    both the adhesion of the    
             panels             

111
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,505
     and the waterproofing      
         of the seams.          

112
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,776
   but if he applies too much   
             glue,              

113
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,045
         it could bleed         
   into the colored panels.     

114
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,717
   he pushes the glued panels   
    together at the seams.      

115
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,192
 the panels adhere instantly,   

116
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,328
        and the wetsuit         
    comes together quickly.     

117
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,767
 it takes him about 45 minutes  
  to put a wetsuit together.    

118
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,078
 he inserts paper in the bottom 
     half of the wetsuit.       

119
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,846
    this prevents the front     
          of the suit           

120
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,348
   from sticking to the back    

121
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,817
  as he joins the top assembly  
        to the bottom.          

122
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,923
      he lets the glue dry      
      for a few minutes.        

123
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,095
       then, a seamstress       
   turns the suit inside out    

124
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,363
    and stitches the seams.     

125
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,931
   she uses a curved needle,    

126
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,701
  so it doesn't go all the way  
      through the fabric.       

127
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,904
      this is called blind      
           stitching.           

128
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,038
     it doesn't puncture the    
            fabric.             

129
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,509
  it also creates flat seams.   

130
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,112
      using a hot roller,       
    she applies nylon tape      

131
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:44,116
    to the back of the seams    
   for extra waterproofing.     

132
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:47,553
 a nozzle blows hot air to melt 
 the adhesive onto the fabric.  

133
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:54,126
   she sews a plastic zipper    
 onto the back of the wetsuit   

134
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,062
  and attaches a hook-and-loop  
stopper, to prevent unzipping.  

135
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,801
  another team member brushes   

136
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,336
        rubberized glue         
      around the zipper.        

137
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:09,274
     he presses the edges       

138
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,343
      of a neoprene panel       
      to the glued area,        

139
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,615
 creating a waterproof barrier  
      around the zipper.        

140
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,618
he trims the end of the panel.  

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,254
  this custom neoprene wetsuit  
         is complete.           

142
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:29,561
     from start to finish,      
    the process takes 5 to 6    
             hours.             

143
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:33,165
     he tests the zipper and    
             closely            
 scrutinizes the workmanship.   

144
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,835
         after passing          
    an initial inspection,      

145
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,938
          this wetsuit          
    is ready for a fitting.     

146
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,546
     a good fit is crucial      
      to its performance.       

147
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,783
         if the wetsuit         
     doesn't fit properly,      

148
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,718
  cold water will pass through  
               it               

149
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,288
     and the suit will fail     
   to keep the surfer warm.     

150
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,529
     it meets expectations,     
   so she's ready to test the   
             water              

151
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,498
        with this custom        
       neoprene wetsuit.        

152
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,819
 airplanes need to be durable,  
to withstand the wear and tear  

153
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,821
      of frequent flying        

154
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,558
   and the dangers of landing   
     on rugged airstrips.       

155
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,829
      most small airplanes      
    are made with aluminum      

156
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,566
    because it's both sturdy    
       and lightweight.         

157
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,639
     some aluminum aircraft     
       are twin engines,        

158
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,108
 meaning they have a propeller  
         on each wing.          

159
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,776
     single-engine models,      
        like this one,          

160
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,379
      have one propeller,       
    typically on the nose.      

161
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,051
         this airplane          
 also has a pressurized cabin,  

162
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:02,354
  so it can reach an altitude   
     of about 30,000 feet.      

163
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:07,125
  it also has a deicing system  
     for the wings, tail,       

164
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,527
     and propeller blades,      

165
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,530
      so it can fly safely      
   in cold, wet conditions.     

166
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,203
   the aluminum is delivered    
 to the factory in long rolls.  

167
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,872
     they unwind each roll      
     and feed the aluminum      

168
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,042
   through a series of heavy    
    rollers, to press out the   
             curl.              

169
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,545
       a blade at the end       
        of the machine          

170
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,616
 automatically slices the flat  
 aluminum into smaller pieces.  

171
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,091
         the thickness          
    of the aluminum varies,     

172
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,593
     depending on the part      
        they're making.         

173
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,632
    they use a 3-millimeter     
       sheet of aluminum        

174
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,701
      to make the cockpit       
       instrument panel.        

175
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,246
     a computer-guided mill     
       cuts the profile,        

176
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,582
       drills screw holes       
       for installation,        

177
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,218
   and cuts all the openings    
   for the instrumentation.     

178
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,123
   the sheet goes from this     

179
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,492
           to this.             

180
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,466
 a computer-guided router cuts  
      out most of the wing      
          components.           

181
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,684
        workers feed it         
    between machine rollers     

182
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,321
      that slowly bend it       
     to a specific angle.       

183
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,833
  once the bend is complete,    

184
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,102
       they use templates       
      to check both sides       

185
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,538
         and make sure          
   it meets specifications.     

186
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:08,045
   during production, residue   
   from the factory machines    

187
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,782
    contaminate the aluminum    
            pieces,             

188
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,583
     so, once all the parts     
         are created,           

189
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,386
 they are thoroughly cleaned.   

190
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,261
    the machine washes them     
     in soapy water twice       

191
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,863
   and then rinses them off.    

192
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,401
   once the parts are clean,    

193
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:33,338
   the machine submerges them   
       in an acid bath.         

194
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,575
     this preps the surface     
    for a coat of protective    
            primer.             

195
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:45,117
   once it's primed, workers    
     clean the surface with     
            solvent.            

196
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,360
    then, they lay the part     
 on a sheet of epoxy adhesive   

197
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,630
  and cut along the perimeter,  
to create an adhesive backing.  

198
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,938
  later, they'll activate the   
     adhesive with heat and     
           pressure.            

199
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,182
       once all the parts       
      have their custom-cut     
           adhesive,            

200
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,751
     workers assemble them      
     on a bonding fixture.      

201
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,258
  metal clamps hold the parts   
         in position.           

202
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,864
        this assembly is        
    the internal structure      

203
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,400
  of the wing's leading edge.   

204
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,804
        the long pieces         
     are called stringers.      

205
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:41,406
        they're clamped         
     to oval access panels      

206
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,074
    that enable maintenance     
          technicians           

207
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,212
    to get inside the wing.     

208
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,747
     next, workers position     
      and clamp the skin        

209
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,818
   of the leading edge on top   
      of the internal wing      
           structure.           

210
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,890
 they heat the entire assembly  
          in an oven            

211
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,561
          for 2 hours           
      at 275 fahrenheit.        

212
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,165
  this activates the adhesive   

213
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,568
  and bonds all the assembled   
        parts together.         

214
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,239
    meanwhile, another team     
 assembles the aluminum frame   

215
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,774
       of the airplane's        
       fuselage section.        

216
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,910
      they load the parts       
   onto an assembly fixture     

217
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,312
   and rivet them together.     

218
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,315
        when we return,         

219
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,718
   they'll apply an aluminum    
      cover to the frame.       

220
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,404
     the aluminum skin of an    
            airplane            
 consists of numerous panels,   

221
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:51,009
    so the body is easier to    
            repair.             

222
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,611
   technicians simply remove    
      the damaged panel,        

223
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,515
      instead of replacing      
      the entire section.       

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,955
   workers start by applying    
      an airtight sealant       

225
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:07,425
       to close any gaps        
    between the skin and the    
             frame.             

226
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:11,062
  the fuselage must be sealed,  
       so the cabin can be      
          pressurized.          

227
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,966
      a pressurized cabin       

228
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,903
  allows passengers to breathe  
      comfortably at higher     
           altitudes.           

229
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,310
 once the sealing is complete,  

230
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,446
 they attach the corresponding  
     aluminum skin panel.       

231
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,182
      it has already been       
       primed for paint.        

232
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,986
  they apply cleko fasteners,   
  to properly align the panel   

233
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,522
    until it's riveted to the   
             frame.             

234
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,991
 then, they select the rivets.  

235
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,594
      they'll need rivets       
of various sizes and strengths  

236
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,262
    for the different parts     
         of the plane.          

237
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,734
 they begin riveting the holes  

238
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,870
        that don't have         
   cleko fasteners in them.     

239
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,846
  then, they remove the clekos  
and rivet those holes as well.  

240
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,222
     the fuselage is built      
       in six sections.         

241
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,358
    the front section houses    
    the engine compartment.     

242
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,896
        all the sections        
    have attachment panels      

243
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:24,102
 that fit in between the frame  
and skin of the adjacent part.  

244
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,505
         workers rivet          
    the sections together.      

245
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,908
     once the back sections     
        are installed,          

246
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,644
    they rivet the completed    
   fuselage to the main spar    

247
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,112
   that connects the wings.     

248
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,249
  they install the retractable  
         landing gear,          

249
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,519
    the tail-section rudder,    
       and stabilizers.         

250
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,623
  they also install the moving  
      flaps and ailerons.       

251
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,196
     workers weld together      
          steel tubes           

252
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,697
  to create the engine mount.   

253
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,802
  the mount will be installed   
   in the engine compartment    

254
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,337
 in the front of the fuselage.  

255
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,875
    this section also houses    
    the nose landing gear.      

256
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,144
      they prime and paint      
    the steel engine mount,     

257
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,512
     to prevent corrosion.      

258
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,618
        this plane has a        
         500-horsepower         
        turbine engine.         

259
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,088
        workers bolt it         
     to the engine mount.       

260
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,423
   then, they bolt the engine   
             mount              

261
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,225
       to the airplane's        
      engine compartment.       

262
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,401
   the engine rotates a shaft   
  which spins the propeller.    

263
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,908
 meanwhile, all the airplane's  
       electrical wiring        

264
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,311
         is mapped out          
     on an assembly board.      

265
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,447
    each wire has a number.     

266
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:46,851
     the wires are arranged     
 in a specific configuration.   

267
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,789
  then, workers group the wires 
               by               
their location in the airplane  

268
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,957
          and tie them          
     in a wiring harness.       

269
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,462
  these wires are for the back  
   of the instrument panel.     

270
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,399
      the circuit breakers      
          are located           

271
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,702
         on either side         
 of the flight display panel.   

272
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,139
   with the push of a button,   
    the pilot can customize     

273
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,842
   the information displayed    
     on the center screen.      

274
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,147
  technicians thoroughly test   
 all the electronic functions,  

275
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,849
           as well as           
     the autopilot system.      

276
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,155
           one pilot            
    can operate this plane,     

277
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,292
   but it comes with an extra   
              yoke,             
   to accommodate a copilot.    

278
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,030
  workers install the interior  
       and the windows.         

279
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,567
     then, mechanics verify     
 the flight control surfaces,   

280
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,503
        the moving parts        
     on the wings and tail      

281
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,572
      that change altitude      
         or direction.          

282
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,776
     here, they're checking     
         the ailerons.          

283
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:48,847
   a mechanic in the cockpit    
        turns the yoke          

284
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,049
       while another uses       
        a rigging board         

285
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:54,452
           to measure           
   how the aileron responds.    

286
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,788
      if the angle's off,       
    he makes an adjustment.     

287
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,060
  they check the landing gear,  
  to make sure it drops down    

288
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:03,762
         from the wing          
    and engine compartment.     

289
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:10,201
   then, they mask the windows  
               and              
apply a second coat of primer,  

290
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,738
      for extra protection      
      against corrosion.        

291
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,207
     when the primer dries,     
     they paint the plane       

292
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,810
       to the customer's        
        specifications.         

293
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,013
  then, they paint the plane's  
      registration number       

294
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,948
         on both sides,         
      as required by law.       

295
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,354
 the airplane's deicing system  
  heats the propeller blades    

296
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,824
     to melt ice buildup.       

297
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,359
    it also uses inflatable     
        rubber bladders         

298
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,828
      attached to the wing      
           and tail.            

299
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,497
   the pilot throws a switch    
    to inflate the bladders     

300
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,233
      and break any ice,        

301
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:46,337
 ensuring a smooth, safe ride,  
      even in poor weather      
          conditions.
