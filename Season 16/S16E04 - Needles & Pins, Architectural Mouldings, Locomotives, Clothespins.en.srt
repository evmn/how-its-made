captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,518
narrator: throughout history,      

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,589
sewing needles have kept things 
from falling apart at the seams.

5
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,658
from primitive times, when needles were made of bone,

6
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,928
to today's thin steel versions,

7
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,130
sewing needles have played an important role in our lives.

8
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:06,865
for many years, this simple tool        

9
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,902
made it possible to clothe an entire family.  

10
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,275
today, when most clothing is factory-made,        

11
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,877
a sewing kit remains a household essential.     

12
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,613
when things start to unravel, 

13
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:23,616
a needle and thread offer a quick fix.       

14
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:27,753
sewing needles begin with thin steel wire.  

15
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,023
machinery uncoils two spools simultaneously   

16
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,692
and pulls the wires across guide wheels      

17
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,695
and into narrow passageways  

18
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:39,699
to remove kinks and straighten the wires.   

19
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,438
and then cutters slice them to the length of two needles. 

20
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,442
the wires exit into shaking chutes      

21
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:52,244
and fall into bins in neat piles.         

22
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:58,384
each one will be used to make two needles.      

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,925
this grinding wheel turns, and, at the same time,     

24
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,861
an overhead wheel revolves in a different direction,    

25
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,063
to bear down on the ends of the wires    

26
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,265
and grind them to a point.   

27
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,067
sparks fly from the friction. 

28
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,038
it takes up to six grindings to make the tips sharp enough. 

29
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,210
then the wires head down the line       

30
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:26,812
to a series of stamping machines.     

31
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,283
the first one flattens each wire at midpoint      

32
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,219
to form two needle heads.   

33
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:38,423
the next stamping device punch-cuts two eyes,      

34
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,692
one in each head.       

35
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,363
the third machine cuts the wire in two      

36
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,201
and trims excess material from around the needle heads. 

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,442
the needles fall into a bin.  

38
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:59,244
in three quick steps, this steel wire        

39
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,515
has been transformed into two sewing needles.    

40
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,720
next they toughen the metal  

41
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,988
by first baking the needles in an oven           

42
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,725
and then quickly bringing down their temperature.       

43
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,194
the temperature shock hardens the needles.      

44
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,330
they cover the needles     

45
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,067
with glycerin oil and a polishing powder.    

46
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:25,471
they wrap them         
in a bundle of plastic and cloth

47
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,272
and stitch it up.       

48
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:32,010
they roll a layer of leather around the bundle of needles. 

49
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,414
the package then goes into a special rolling mill.  

50
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,417
it spins in this machine for two days.         

51
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,955
inside, the needles agitate with the polishing ingredients,

52
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,824
and they emerge looking much smoother.     

53
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:50,362
then it's into a washing machine
for a scrub with soap and water.

54
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,631
this removes the polishing residue     

55
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,967
to prepare them for electroplating.      

56
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,501
electroplating gives the needles

57
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,039
an outer skin of corrosion-resistant nickel. 

58
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,712
the needles now move forward into a sorting system     

59
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:10,182
that ensures the needles are pointing in one direction. 

60
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,387
an inspector examines the needles for flaws 

61
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,057
and sorts out the defective ones.      

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,062
they dip the eyes of some needles in a gold bath 

63
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,330
and apply an electrical charge 

64
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,068
so the gold gravitates to the nickel and adheres.   

65
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,403
a little gold around the eyes makes them stand out,     

66
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,440
so these needles should be easier to thread.  

67
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,812
meanwhile, the production of pins is well underway.   

68
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,482
gas jets melt glass into tiny dollops,       

69
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,885
which stick on to the tops of the pins as they roll by.  

70
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,555
the glass hardens in seconds, 

71
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,691
going from transparent to opaque.           

72
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,961
these glass-headed pins    

73
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,099
are now ready for hemming and other sewing jobs.     

74
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:04,103
the pins fall between two revolving cylinders.    

75
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:07,306
the space between the cylinders
gradually narrows.       

76
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,308
this sorts the pins by size  

77
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,444
as they drop into various bins below.    

78
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,784
now all that's left is the packaging.       

79
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,453
the packaging line is entirely automated.     

80
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,391
robots drop sewing needles into
grooves in plastic packages,  

81
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,927
and the packages move forward. 

82
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:31,163
the timing is flawless.    

83
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,134
finally, a transparent cover  

84
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,738
showcases this product's many selling points.      

85
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,088
narrator: exterior moldings can transform

86
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,557
an ordinary structure into something grand.     

87
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,360
the ancient greeks were the first to demonstrate this, 

88
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:04,029
with elaborate carved moldings on temples.          

89
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,432
today there's no need to spend long hours carving moldings.  

90
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,168
fabricated synthetic versions are now available       

91
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,771
to give a structure instant curb appeal.      

92
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,244
architectural foam moldings trick the eye.         

93
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:20,512
they look like stone or wood, 

94
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,714
and it's all a carefully crafted illusion  

95
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,951
to impress the neighbors or passersby.         

96
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,990
they start with a big block of foam.   

97
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:33,659
it's expanded polystyrene, or e.p.s.           

98
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,728
they activate a hot-wire foam cutter.    

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,998
controlled by computer software,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,733
it melts its way through the thick foam block  

101
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,937
to make very precise and intricate cuts.       

102
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,006
this computerized hot wire   

103
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,476
is cutting out pieces of architectural trim     

104
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,078
for windows or doors.     

105
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,149
it carves in an economical way to minimize waste.       

106
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,618
its work done, the hot wire rises,      

107
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,356
leaving a trail of smoke from the burning process.   

108
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:07,226
a worker then pushes out the moldings.         

109
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,599
each piece of architectural trim
is 8 feet in length.      

110
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,641
the hot wire now carves an elaborate fluted column,  

111
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,709
one half at a time.      

112
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,980
this is a roman-style column. 

113
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:29,715
once carved in stone,     

114
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:33,052
it's now being replicated in foam.            

115
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:36,121
and this old-world look can now be achieved      

116
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,358
with minimal physical effort. 

117
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,930
to make an arch, they use a hot-wire shape   

118
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,532
instead of a computerized straight wire.         

119
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:51,270
they position it in front of a curved piece of foam.   

120
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:54,807
rubber drive wheels push the foam through the hot wire. 

121
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:58,610
these wheels have been preset to accurately steer the cut.  

122
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,080
the result is an arch that will be a perfect match  

123
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,749
for the linear trim produced earlier,       

124
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,418
so they'll fit together seamlessly.          

125
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,091
they use a carved foam wedge to emulate the keystone,    

126
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,560
a piece used in stone arches  

127
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,497
to lock parts together at midpoint.          

128
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,302
a worker now wraps the cut foam
moldings in fiberglass mesh.  

129
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,974
pre-infused with glue, the mesh
instantly adheres to the foam. 

130
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,110
this mesh adds strength to the molding,        

131
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,580
and it also makes it crack-resistant.        

132
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:45,858
next, cement flows into a hopper
and onto the moldings below.  

133
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,095
the moldings are driven    

134
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,398
through a template with the same contours,    

135
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,201
to apply the cement evenly on the surface and the sides. 

136
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,336
this is no ordinary cement.  

137
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,004
it's a pre-engineered mix,   

138
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,207
fortified with a special resin 

139
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,111
to create a durable coating for the mesh-covered moldings. 

140
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,351
a worker then transfers the moldings to a rack     

141
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,819
to cure for a minimum of 24 hours          

142
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,289
before getting another coating of cement,   

143
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,159
this one with a much finer texture.   

144
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,695
it's much trickier to apply cement        

145
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,497
to an arch-shaped piece of molding,          

146
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,100
so they take a more hands-on approach.   

147
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:32,171
the employee scoops the cement 
onto the meshed-foam semicircle.

148
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,375
he then moves the custom-made template over the molding,   

149
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,845
instead of pushing the molding through it.    

150
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:42,314
it's a better way to evenly distribute the cement

151
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,416
on a curved surface.      

152
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:52,324
after carving, meshing, and two layers of cement,   

153
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,593
this arch is now ready.    

154
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,333
for smaller orders, they also apply the cement manually.   

155
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,335
there's no need for a machine setup      

156
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,605
when there are only      
one or two columns to be coated.

157
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,940
guided by a track on the side of a table,    

158
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,542
the worker slowly draws the template   

159
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,677
down the roman-style column  

160
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:17,182
to apply the cement to the foam
and make it look like stone.  

161
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,689
the second layer gets extra attention.     

162
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,758
he rubs the cement into the grooves for complete coverage 

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,694
and then pulls the template across once again,       

164
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,897
this time lightly skimming the surface  

165
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,566
to produce a finer texture.  

166
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,036
and now these moldings     

167
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:41,707
are ready to add detail and definition to a structure. 

168
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,389
narrator: a locomotive is the powerful vehicle    

169
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,858
at the front of a train    

170
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,993
that pulls the cars along the track.        

171
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,863
sometimes there's a second one pushing from behind, as well.  

172
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,333
passenger-train locomotives are smaller          

173
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,002
and designed primarily for speed.           

174
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,070
freight locomotives pulling railcars        

175
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,007
are significantly larger and stronger.         

176
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,611
heavy hauls are mammoth freight locomotives

177
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,546
designed for north america,  

178
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,548
where tracks are wider and stronger          

179
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,885
than in most other parts of the world.         

180
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,155
those smaller yellow locomotives
are for the european market.  

181
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:35,160
the larger gray ones to the right are heavy hauls. 

182
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,363
workers weld together massive pieces of steel    

183
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,499
to construct the locomotive's structural underframe.     

184
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,702
at each end, they insert a giant steel pin 

185
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,905
through a hole in the underframe's floor.   

186
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,174
for now, they weld the pins partially  

187
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,143
to tack them in position.   

188
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,514
next, lifting and maneuvering it
with giant trunnions,     

189
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,050
they flip the underframe    

190
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:01,052
so that the protruding side of the pins is facing upward. 

191
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,323
then a crane system transfers the underframe    

192
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:07,058
to another area to complete the welding.    

193
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,461
the pins require exceptional bonding      

194
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,864
because they connect the underframe to the wheel frames.

195
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,668
an automated welder circles each pin repeatedly,  

196
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,938
progressively building up an inch-thick weld.      

197
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,542
they make the same size weld on the other side of the pin. 

198
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,280
all the welded steel parts are exceptionally thick,    

199
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:34,019
rendering the underframe strong enough to pull 500 tons.

200
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,222
next, they install the air reservoir and pipes  

201
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,091
for the pneumatic brake system 

202
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,427
and a 5,300-gallon fuel tank. 

203
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,961
then they assemble       

204
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,498
the locomotive's six traction motors.      

205
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,368
each one generates 750 horsepower --        

206
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,903
3 times more than a typical car --     

207
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,640
giving the locomotive 4,500-horsepower strength.   

208
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,642
to build each traction motor, 

209
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,780
they bolt coils of wound copper 
into a cylinder called a stator.

210
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,715
then they lower another cylinder,       

211
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,917
called an armature, into the stator.        

212
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,719
powered by an alternator,   

213
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,521
the coils produce an electric field       

214
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,390
that rotates the armature,   

215
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:14,993
turning components which propel the locomotive.  

216
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,195
workers lubricate the wheels  

217
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,264
then, using a strong press,  

218
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,067
fit two on each of the vehicle's six axles.  

219
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,804
each wheel is a yard in diameter
and weighs about a half a ton. 

220
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,274
the axle has a large gear that turns both wheels.    

221
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,677
this finished unit is called a wheel-axle-gear assembly -- 

222
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,145
"w.a.g." for short.      

223
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,814
workers install a w.a.g.    

224
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,083
onto each of the six traction motors.        

225
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,153
the w.a.g.'s gear engages with the traction motor's gear,

226
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,755
so when the motor runs, that gear turns,        

227
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,890
which then rotates the w.a.g. gear,        

228
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,425
which turns the wheels.    

229
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,429
so now there are six w.a.g.  
and traction motor combinations.

230
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,231
workers divide them into two groups of three    

231
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,501
then bolt each trio into a frame called a bogie.  

232
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,237
so, now the locomotive has two bogies,        

233
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,641
each with an air-driven brake system built into it.  

234
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:05,710
until this point, the bogies have been upside down.     

235
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,246
now a crane flips them right side up         

236
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,783
to prepare for the final assembly of the locomotive.  

237
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,925
they position the two bogies next to the underframe     

238
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,460
at opposite ends.       

239
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,130
cranes then lift the underframe

240
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,467
and slowly lower it onto the bogies.        

241
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:34,272
the pivot pins protruding from beneath the upper frame  

242
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,242
drop into receiving holes in the bogies.         

243
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,213
next, they lower a giant alternator       

244
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,281
onto the deck of the underframe.

245
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,350
it powers the traction motors 

246
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:49,420
as well as the control systems and other auxiliary equipment. 

247
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,891
this 16-cylinder, 4,500-horsepower engine    

248
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,493
drives the alternator.     

249
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,896
next, the operator's cab --  

250
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,697
it's insulated for sound    

251
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,634
and sits on a shock-absorber system.  

252
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,638
then the various electrical hookups,      

253
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,974
including these thick cables. 

254
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:12,043
each one contains more than 1,000 wires,     

255
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,413
carrying nearly 10,000 amps.  

256
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,787
now a hood goes over the engine
and alternator         

257
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,123
to protect them from the elements.       

258
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,726
from here, the locomotive goes to another department   

259
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,728
for paint and decals.     

260
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,667
the finished locomotive is 75 feet long.        

261
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,938
fueled up, it weighs 225 tons       

262
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,873
and, depending on the terrain, 

263
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,644
can haul a train up to 6/10 of a mile long.   

264
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,159
narrator: the first clothespin was invented          

265
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,561
in the early 1800s by the shakers.        

266
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,563
it was a cylindrical piece of wood         

267
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,832
with a vertical notch cut into the bottom.      

268
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,435
in 1853, an american inventor 

269
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,571
patented a spring-loaded, two-piece lever clothespin.  

270
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,642
that's the type still produced today in both plastic and wood.

271
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,249
this czech company makes clothespins out of beech wood. 

272
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,285
beech is ideal because it's hard and durable. 

273
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,856
when the logs arrive at the factory,        

274
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:35,126
an automated band saw slices each one laterally   

275
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,863
into 2.8-inch-thick planks.  

276
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,333
wood is naturally damp,    

277
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,868
so it's critical to dry the planks.       

278
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,870
otherwise, clothespins made from them   

279
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,939
would repeatedly expand and contract      

280
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,407
with temperature changes    

281
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,209
and eventually crack.     

282
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,812
first, the planks air-dry outdoors for about 7 months,  

283
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,149
until their moisture level drops to 20%.         

284
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,352
then the planks go into a kiln for 3 or 4 weeks        

285
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,524
to bring the moisture level down
to between 8% and 10%.     

286
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,894
the wood, now stable, workers cut the planks     

287
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:13,297
into shorter, more manageable lengths...   

288
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,003
then into 2 1/2" x 2 1/2" blocks.    

289
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,444
next they feed the blocks into a cutting machine.    

290
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,113
its four circular blades    

291
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,782
simultaneously saw through each block,      

292
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,051
cutting it into five pieces.  

293
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,421
each piece is 4/10 of an inch thick.   

294
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,860
as these thin pieces exit the machine,       

295
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,662
workers inspect them.     

296
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,799
any pieces with knots or other flaws are removed   

297
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,869
and sold to a factory that makes mousetraps.     

298
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,803
the pieces which pass inspection

299
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,707
go into an automated milling machine.        

300
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,144
it cuts each piece into four smaller pieces    

301
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,213
then, in each smaller piece,  

302
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,483
carves the shape of a clothespin clip on the front 

303
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,086
and a notch in the back.    

304
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:22,700
so, each thin piece of wood has gone from this...     

305
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,903
to this...           

306
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,972
to this.            

307
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,441
the notch on the back     

308
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,444
will hold the spring that mates two clips      

309
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,980
and produces the tension they need to grip.       

310
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,052
the next machine saws four lines
down each piece,        

311
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:45,390
cutting it into five identical clips.   

312
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,729
before...           

313
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,664
and after.           

314
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,667
all that cutting leaves rough, splintered edges,    

315
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,270
so workers now load the clips into a sanding barrel.     

316
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,073
as the barrel revolves,    

317
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,275
the clips rub against each other,      

318
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,545
the abrasion gradually smoothing the rough wood.   

319
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,416
workers also place a piece of wax amid the clips. 

320
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,018
as the barrel turns,      

321
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,219
particles rub off and coat the wood,       

322
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,155
making it even smoother.    

323
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,024
meanwhile, another automated machine   

324
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:23,994
makes the springs out of 5/100"-thick iron wire. 

325
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,098
the wire has has a zinc coating
on it to prevent rust.     

326
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,633
watch in slow motion      

327
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,302
how the machine twists the wire seven times  

328
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,571
to make the coil portion of the spring         

329
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:38,243
then bends the ends to make the
part that fits into the notch. 

330
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:42,113
with all the parts ready to go,
it's assembly time.      

331
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,315
workers load clips and springs 

332
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,785
into separate chutes of the assembly machine.    

333
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,586
as each spring drops down,   

334
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,656
a mechanical finger pushes the end aside      

335
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:55,393
to clear the way for a pair of clips to encase the coil.  

336
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,063
then it releases the end of the
spring into the clip notches. 

337
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,732
the machine does all this   

338
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,534
at a rate of 8,000 clothespins per hour.           

339
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:08,072
the finished clothespins drop onto a conveyor belt   

340
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,074
that transports them to the next machine,      

341
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,011
which groups them by the dozen.

342
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,352
from there, it's off to the packaging machine,   

343
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,423
which is preset to assemble a specific retail format.   

344
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,491
this is a 36-count package,  

345
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,162
so they've set the machine to stack three dozen clothespins. 

346
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,234
after placing a paper label on top,            

347
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,937
the machine shrink-wraps the package.          

348
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,511
clothespins may be rather ordinary products,   

349
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:50,048
but their reputation is always on the line.     

350
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,861
if you have any comments about the show,        

351
