2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,573
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,319
    narrator: the lead inside   
  a pencil isn't actually lead. 

4
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,521
      it's mostly graphite,     

5
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,256
 which was discovered in england
        in the mid-1500s,       

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,192
          giving birth          
     to the pencil industry.    

7
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,861
    in 1795, a french chemist   

8
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,930
       invented a new type      
         of pencil lead,        

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,666
made of graphite powder and clay
        fired in an oven,       

10
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,369
 making it possible to produce  
 leads with different hardness. 

11
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,941
     for the pencil's body,     

12
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,810
     you need a type of wood    
 that's soft enough to sharpen, 

13
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,345
  yet strong enough not to bend 

14
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,281
       under the writer's       
         hand pressure.         

15
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:26,018
   this german pencil factory   
   uses cedar from california.  

16
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,752
   the wood is .2 inches thick  

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,391
   and arrives precut in slats  
      of 7 x 2 1/2 inches.      

18
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:39,131
   one by one, the slats pass   
  under a giant cutting wheel.  

19
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,768
        it carves grooves       

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,571
  that will become the channel  
         down the middle        

21
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:48,440
      that holds the lead.      

22
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,576
        the next machine        
  fills the grooves with glue,  

23
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,512
      a special formulation     
    that's slightly elastic.    

24
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,780
     this cushions the lead     

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,784
    so that it's less likely    
  to break inside the channel.  

26
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,257
     every second slat moves    
   onto another conveyor belt.  

27
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,326
 the ones that stay on this line

28
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,529
     head toward the machine    
     that lays in the lead.     

29
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:14,066
        the lead is made        
 of a graphite-and-clay mixture,

30
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:17,669
   baked in an oven at almost   
   1,500 degrees fahrenheit.    

31
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,406
 the lead-laying machine's wheel
    loads itself with leads,    

32
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,677
     their spacing matching     
    the grooves in the slats.   

33
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,614
      it's the same process     
      for colored pencils,      

34
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,816
 only the leads are made of wax,
       clay, and pigments       

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,952
    with no baking required.    

36
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,293
  now for the slats that move   
  to that other conveyor belt.  

37
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,695
        an automated arm        
      flips each one over,      

38
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,964
            slides it           
    across a glue applicator,   

39
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:50,302
then drops it onto a leaded slat
   on the other conveyor belt.  

40
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,241
   all the steps to this point  

41
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,678
   have culminated in what is   
  effectively a lead sandwich.  

42
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,519
     now a plunger squeezes     
    those sandwiches together   

43
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,255
  with a full ton of pressure.  

44
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,492
 it compresses them for an hour 
      while the glue dries.     

45
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,262
           after that,          

46
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,999
  it's just a matter of slicing 
  the sandwiches into pencils.  

47
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,602
  the shaping machine makes the 
 hexagonal profile in two steps.

48
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,940
     first, its upper cutter    
    forms three sides on top,   

49
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,143
  then its lower cutter shapes  
   three sides on the bottom.   

50
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,279
   as soon as the bottom side   
  is cut, the pencils separate. 

51
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,955
 a worker pulls a sample pencil 

52
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,157
         from each batch        
       coming off the line      

53
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,294
    and manually sharpens it    
   to spot-check lead quality.  

54
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,431
then he applies force to the tip
        until it breaks.        

55
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,632
          for a pencil          
   to pass this strength test,  

56
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,036
  it has to withstand at least  
     4 1/2 pounds of force.     

57
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,839
     now it's time to dress     
         that bare wood.        

58
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,307
         one at a time,         

59
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:05,176
   the pencils shoot through a  
device called a lacquering head.

60
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,112
   it coats the wood in paint,  
      yellow in this case.      

61
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:12,985
 it takes four coats of paint to
 completely hide the wood grain.

62
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,255
     a fifth lacquering head    
     paints a black stripe,     

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,190
    this company's trademark.   

64
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,793
        then a sixth head       
       seals the paint job      

65
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,729
   with a transparent lacquer.  

66
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,064
      from the paint line,      

67
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,734
   the pencils make their way   
      to a stamping machine     

68
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,403
      at an astounding rate     
    of 500 pencils a minute.    

69
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,071
   the machine heat-transfers   
         foil lettering         

70
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,942
      from a plastic film       
      to the painted wood.      

71
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,745
   last stop -- the rubber-tip  
        assembly machine.       

72
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,281
       first, it squeezes       
      the top of the pencil     

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,216
to slide on an aluminum ferrule.

74
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,820
 then it inserts a rubber eraser
  into the ferrule's other end  

75
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,423
    and squeezes that tight.    

76
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,696
     european-style pencils     
   have a painted cap instead,  

77
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,699
      the color indicating      
      how hard the lead is.     

78
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,502
          after a coat          
     of transparent sealer,     

79
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,038
    the pencils take a series   
   of dips in the first color,  

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,107
     then, once that dries,     
      in the second color.      

81
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,810
         the final coat         
    is a high-gloss lacquer.    

82
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,648
  the pencils are finally ready 
           to roll...           

83
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,584
     across a grinding drum     
         for sharpening.        

84
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,759
   by the time they roll off,   
   they're pointed perfection.  

85
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,265
looking as good as they perform,

86
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,535
         today's pencils        
   sure have the right stuff.   

87
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,018
  narrator: there are two types 
        of scrap metal --       

88
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,152
     ferrous and nonferrous.    

89
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,088
          ferrous scrap         
     is scrap iron and steel    

90
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,756
that comes mainly from old cars.

91
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,090
     nonferrous scrap metal     

92
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,760
   includes aluminum, copper,   
        lead, and nickel.       

93
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,029
  and the best part is metals   
  can be recycled indefinitely  

94
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,766
         without losing         
    any of their properties.    

95
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,706
 each year, north american auto 
 plants build millions of cars. 

96
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,442
  eventually, they end up here, 

97
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,112
   at a scrap-metal-recycling   
            facility.           

98
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,714
     it takes about two days    
  to process the raw material,  

99
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,084
 mostly old cars and appliances.

100
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,389
  crane and bulldozer operators 
      scan the raw material     

101
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,124
  as they gather and stack it.  

102
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,927
  they're looking for anything  
      they can't process --     

103
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:39,397
 propane tanks, glass, or heavy 
    iron that will not shred    

104
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,867
   and that could cause damage  
        to the machinery.       

105
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,278
          an inspector          
     goes into the stockpile    

106
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,013
      to check the material     
          more closely,         

107
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,883
 then signals the crane operator

108
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,585
       that he can proceed      
       with the next load.      

109
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,832
       the crane's grapple      
    delivers load after load    

110
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,168
      onto a conveyor belt      
   that leads into a shredder.  

111
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,304
the belt speeds up or slows down

112
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,306
     according to the weight    
         of the material        

113
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,575
  to feed just the right amount 
       into the shredder.       

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,448
    here's the feed box that    
contains the shredder laid open.

115
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,984
          an inspector          
   checks it daily for damage.  

116
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,454
 there's a lot of wear and tear 
       on this machinery.       

117
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,628
       a 4,000-pound drum       
       grabs the material       

118
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,330
  as it comes off the conveyor  

119
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,465
and forces it into the shredder.

120
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,069
  its giant hammers pound away  
    at the cars, mattresses,    

121
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,870
   and other recyclable items,  

122
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,440
         shredding them         
     into fist-sized chunks.    

123
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,115
      an industrial vacuum      

124
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,150
    sucks out bits of rubber    
            or glass            

125
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,987
            mixed in            
    with the shredded steel.    

126
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,425
        the steel pieces        
 stick to these magnetic drums. 

127
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,296
   anything else falls through  
    to a conveyor belt below.   

128
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,633
      here, pickers remove      
      any unwanted material     

129
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,901
   caught on the steel pieces,  

130
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,303
  and the clean shredded steel  
      is ready for shipping     

131
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,873
  to customers like steel mills 
         and foundries.         

132
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,376
 the material the magnetic drums
          don't collect         

133
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,779
  goes on for more processing.  

134
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,316
   there's precious nonferrous  
 metals such as copper or brass 

135
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,486
 mixed in with shredded debris. 

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,256
   it all goes into a machine   
        called a trommel,       

137
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,160
 where a rotating drum separates
      the material by size.     

138
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,732
      any leftover residue      
         is just trash.         

139
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,733
       but before it goes       
         to a landfill,         

140
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,135
     an inspector checks it     

141
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,505
    to make sure no valuable    
  material has slipped through. 

142
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,884
  the material from the trommel 

143
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,687
       is evenly dispersed      
         onto a conveyor        

144
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,954
   that takes it to a machine   

145
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,757
             called             
   an eddy current separator.   

146
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,494
inside, a rotating magnetic drum
creates a strong magnetic field 

147
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,898
  that repels nonferrous metals 
   right up and over a barrier  

148
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,434
       into a storage bin.      

149
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:33,238
    any material that doesn't   
    make it over the barrier    

150
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,374
   goes through the separator   
   one more time, just in case  

151
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,444
   there's still some valuable  
   nonferrous metals mixed in.  

152
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,785
   a conveyor belt carries out  
      the worthless residue     

153
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,219
        to a trash heap.        

154
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,660
    a different conveyor belt   

155
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,596
  carries the nonferrous metal  
      out of the separator      

156
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,665
     and loads it into a bin    
            for sale.           

157
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,201
   it will go to another plant  
    where they'll separate it   

158
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:07,105
   by type of metal -- mainly   
  copper, brass, and aluminum.  

159
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,880
    after all that shredding,   
    sifting, and separating,    

160
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,150
       here's what's left       
    of the average used car.    

161
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:24,022
 take away the rubber, plastic, 
         and upholstery,        

162
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:28,092
          and you have          
     some shredded steel...     

163
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,529
       and some valuable        
       nonferrous metals.       

164
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,564
 that's a lot of useful material

165
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,868
    thanks to some efficient    
           recycling.           

166
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,182
            narrator:           
      according to legend,      

167
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,450
    a goat herder in ethiopia   

168
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:53,985
        discovered coffee       
         around 850 a.d.        

169
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,254
    eventually, the beverage    
         reached italy,         

170
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,257
    where the first european    
   coffeehouse opened in 1645.  

171
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,259
  today, about 2 billion cups   
  of coffee are drunk each day  

172
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,595
        around the world,       

173
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:06,398
  making coffee the second-most 
   valuable trading commodity   

174
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,899
           after oil.           

175
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,205
     coffee's flavor depends    
  on the region where it grows  

176
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,375
   and the way coffee makers    
   roast and blend the beans.   

177
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,211
       here in costa rica,      

178
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,080
     they grow coffee plants    
       from sprouted seeds      

179
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,283
       kept in containers       
         for a full year        

180
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,819
   before they transplant them  
         into the field.        

181
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,589
   from seed to first harvest   
     takes about two years.     

182
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,766
      coffee plants flower      
 over the course of three days, 

183
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,537
    covering the fields with    
  fragrant jasmine-like blooms. 

184
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,109
     over six months' time,     

185
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,978
     the buds grow and ripen    
        into red cherries       

186
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,780
  that contain the coffee bean. 

187
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,385
         pickers harvest        
        the red cherries,       

188
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,052
leaving the green ones to ripen.

189
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,923
     they'll return to pick     
the cherries from the same plant

190
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,124
   five times in three months   
         as they ripen.         

191
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,528
      pickers do their best     
  to have no more than 2 green  

192
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,398
   for every 100 red cherries   
          they harvest.         

193
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,008
 they empty their bins into bags
   and load them into trucks.   

194
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,745
     each bin produces about    
  4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans, 

195
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,682
         enough to make         
    about 200 cups of coffee.   

196
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,886
     the fresher the berry,     
     the better the flavor.     

197
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,688
 cherries picked in the morning 
      are at the wet mill,      

198
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,691
      ready for processing      
         that afternoon.        

199
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,241
        at the wet mill,        
water channels wash the cherries

200
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,676
        and drop them off       
        at a worm screw.        

201
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,045
          it loads them         
     into a pulping machine     

202
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,314
    to remove the outer skin    
           and fruit.           

203
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,588
         a rotating drum        
      presses the cherries      

204
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,259
 against the wall of the pulper 
   and squeezes out the bean.   

205
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,467
    from the pulping machine,   

206
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,405
   the beans flow in water to   
  two large rotating cylinders. 

207
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,741
       they sift the beans      
        to separate them        

208
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,876
      from any of the hard      
         green cherries         

209
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,345
        that pass through       
      the pulping machine.      

210
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,357
      next, the beans bathe     
         in more water,         

211
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,027
 which draws out a thick sugary 
    substance known as miel,    

212
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,763
       "honey" in spanish.      

213
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,066
        the coffee maker        
   then feeds the washed beans  

214
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,169
          to make sure          
    they're no longer sticky.   

215
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,206
       the beans then drop      
   into the drying bin below.   

216
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:08,178
  workers now lay out the beans 
to dry in the traditional way --

217
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,715
   outdoors on a cement patio.  

218
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,117
         for four days,         
    they rake over the beans    

219
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,719
   as they dry in the hot sun.  

220
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,389
  at night, they let the beans  
rest to extract the most flavor.

221
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,494
     once the beans are dry,    
 they go into a milling machine.

222
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,668
 inside, large stones grind away
     the parchment-like hull    

223
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,936
         from the bean.         

224
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,877
         drying methods         
    vary among coffee makers.   

225
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,946
    they're a closely guarded   
             secret.            

226
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,682
            the beans           
    can also dry mechanically   

227
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,818
        in rotating drums       
    that pump in heated air.    

228
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,355
     workers closely monitor    
           the process          

229
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,091
       and empty the drums      
     when the beans are dry.    

230
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,229
   a supervisor smells them to  
 check for a vinegar-like odor. 

231
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,865
    that would mean the beans   
         are fermenting,        

232
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,867
  a result of improper drying.  

233
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,505
          the dry beans         
    have their husks removed,   

234
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,774
           then go on           
     to an oscillating table    

235
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,376
  that separates them by weight 
       into three grades,       

236
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,713
       the heaviest being       
     the first-grade beans.     

237
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,519
   workers pour out each grade  
        into burlap bags.       

238
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:25,456
  their contents must weigh in  
     at 152 pounds per bag.     

239
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,994
  finally, they stitch them up  
  and stack them for shipping.  

240
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,330
         next, we'll see        
        the whole process       

241
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,198
           that turns           
    these green coffee beans    

242
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,135
       into a steaming cup      
       of gourmet coffee.       

243
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,482
  narrator: coffee boasts more  
than 800 flavor characteristics,

244
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,883
 at least double those of wine. 

245
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,686
   roasting reduces the amount  
    of caffeine in the bean.    

246
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,355
           to achieve           
     a dark-espresso roast,     

247
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,557
        the beans remain        
   in the roaster the longest,  

248
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,692
so they have the least caffeine.

249
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,829
   it's the concentrated brew   
  that packs espresso's punch.  

250
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,370
  these green coffee beans have 
 just arrived from the wet mill.

251
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,640
      workers pour them out     
       into a blending bin      

252
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,575
  that feeds a roasting machine 

253
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,911
      heated to 356 degrees     
           fahrenheit.          

254
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,046
      at that temperature,      

255
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,782
 the oils in the beans combust, 

256
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,151
       and the beans roast      
    in less than 20 minutes.    

257
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,755
     the master roaster must    
 regularly check their progress.

258
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,993
       when he determines       
         they're ready,         

259
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,929
    he sets off a light spray   
     of water in the roaster    

260
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,497
    to extinguish the beans.    

261
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,468
 then they pour into a bin where
  they're cooled by forced air. 

262
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,676
         as they roast,         
     the beans go from green    

263
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,813
  to golden brown, then black.  

264
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,416
         before roasting        
  an entire shipment of beans,  

265
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,018
          coffee makers         
    first test a small batch.   

266
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,354
           they follow          
    a standardized procedure    

267
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,623
         at the plant's         
       testing laboratory.      

268
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,025
        first, they roast       
      a half-pound of beans     

269
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,495
       in a small gas oven      
       for a few minutes.       

270
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,303
   then a professional taster   
     measures out the beans     

271
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,705
         and feeds them         
    into an electric grinder.   

272
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,375
 she prepares four separate cups
            of coffee           

273
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,110
   with the same coarse grind.  

274
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,914
        it takes 4 tastes       
    to make sure all is well,   

275
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,151
     20 to detect the source    
       of a problem roast.      

276
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,390
   she begins by pushing aside  
     the foam at the surface    

277
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,392
 to release the intense aromas, 

278
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,996
           a technique          
   known as breaking the cup.   

279
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,199
  she smells each cup in turn,  

280
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,469
 a sure way to know if something
    is wrong with the roast.    

281
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:59,077
   next, she skims the surface  
     to remove the grounds.     

282
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,016
   she takes a sip, slipping    
   the coffee over her tongue   

283
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:08,619
     to get the full flavor     
     before spitting it out.    

284
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,289
  now she can determine how she 
 will balance the blend of beans

285
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,259
       to create a recipe       
 for the perfect cup of coffee. 

286
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,564
   back on the factory floor,   

287
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,801
 the various beans for the blend
       go into a grinder.       

288
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,776
         it will produce        
      the desired grind --      

289
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,713
         coarse, medium,        
  or a fine espresso like this. 

290
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,983
         now the coffee         
     is ready for packaging.    

291
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,253
 it's a fully-automated process 
     thanks to this machine     

292
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,656
       that forms, fills,       
       and seals the bags.      

293
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,860
     gourmet coffee must go     
   piping hot from the grinder  

294
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,062
 to the bag to ensure freshness.

295
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,598
 as the machine seals each bag, 

296
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,999
      it pumps in nitrogen      

297
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,769
      to replace the oxygen     
    that makes coffee stale.    

298
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,075
 the machine separates the bags,

299
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,012
      and they fall onto a      
  custom-designed conveyor belt 

300
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,414
      that weighs each one      
      as it passes through.     

301
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,290
  over at the espresso machine, 

302
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,026
    the barista demonstrates    
     the technique required     

303
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,295
     for a perfect espresso.    

304
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:28,099
   she puts a quarter-ounce of  
 ground coffee into the holder, 

305
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:32,103
      tamps it down firmly,     
    then wedges it in place.    

306
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,606
           the machine          
     applies water pressure     

307
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,174
    to extract the espresso.    

308
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,811
 the distinctive foam is a sign 
    this coffee's first-rate.   

309
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,982
  the barista also demonstrates 

310
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,219
    how to use a french press   
          or cafetière.         

311
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,524
     she adds boiling water     
     to the coffee grounds,     

312
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,527
      then pushes them down     
          to the base.          

313
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,064
  again, she applies pressure,  
       manually this time,      

314
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,099
 to extract the coffee's aroma. 

315
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,409
    finally, she demonstrates   

316
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,545
      how costa ricans make     
  a traditional cup of coffee.  

317
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,950
 she places a chorreador, a fine
   cotton sieve, over the cup,  

318
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,552
  pressing on the ground coffee 
          with a spoon          

319
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,654
 as she pours in boiling water. 

320
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,760
 no matter which one you choose,
  with the right gourmet roast, 

321
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,630
 all three methods will produce 
       an outstanding cup       

322
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,032
   of rich, flavorful coffee.
