2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,806
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,521
      narrator: in the days     
   of the american wild west,   

4
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:58,123
      you didn't leave home     
         without a gun.         

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,126
  both the sheriffs and outlaws 
  carried guns and ammunition.  

6
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,729
    it was important to have    
   your gun easily accessible.  

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,665
        wearing a holster       
        around the waist        

8
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,601
   putts a gun in the perfect   
   position for a quick draw.   

9
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,941
        these handcrafted       
   leather belts and holsters   

10
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,877
  are modeled after those made  
       in the late 1800s.       

11
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,683
    they're made for movies,    
  cowboy shooting competitions, 

12
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,619
  and historical reenactments.  

13
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,890
   a craftsman starts by using  
             a press            

14
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,225
      and a series of dies      

15
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,894
   to cut out out the holster   
      and belt components.      

16
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,563
             this is            
    vegetable-tanned leather,   

17
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,365
    the only type of leather    

18
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,569
     that's flexible enough     
       to carve or stamp.       

19
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:47,906
  he lays a paper template over 
  one end of the holster piece  

20
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,776
and marks tiny dots with an awl.

21
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:52,844
      he connects the dots      
      with a straight line      

22
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,714
      using a small knife.      

23
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,317
 he punches a hole at each dot. 

24
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,654
    the lines and holes form    
         two wide loops.        

25
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,591
    next, he carves a groove    
       for stitches along       

26
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,527
   what will be the main seam   
      of the holster body.      

27
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,597
he sprays water onto the leather
          to soften it.         

28
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,734
    he makes decorative lines   
         with a compass.        

29
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,740
   then, he imprints a design   
        into the leather        

30
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,743
       by striking a stamp      
         with a mallet.         

31
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,883
  because the leather is moist, 
      it compresses easily,     

32
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,087
assuming the shape of the stamp.

33
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,690
        these stamps are        
        modern-day copies       

34
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:43,094
        of the ones used        
    in the late 19th century.   

35
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,966
   a rosette is a common motif  
          of that era.          

36
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,301
        he uses one tool        
        for the outline,        

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,770
       one for the petals,      

38
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,040
   and another for the center   
         of the flower.         

39
00:02:55,042 --> 00:03:00,178
   then, he adds details with   
   a small chisel-edged knife   

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,384
 and stamps on his maker's mark.

41
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:11,590
   he shaves any sharp corners  
 and smoothly finishes the edge.

42
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:15,928
  the holster piece is now cut, 
   embellished, and finished.   

43
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,129
   the next step is to sew it.  

44
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,733
    he marks the stitch holes   
        across the bottom       

45
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:25,337
     where he will later sew    
          the toe plug.         

46
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,607
   then, he pierces the holes   
          with an awl.          

47
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:35,480
   he soaks some sheep's wool   
in neatsfoot oil and rubs it in.

48
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,550
  this nourishes and conditions 
          the leather,          

49
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,687
   preserving the impressions   
    and enhancing the color.    

50
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,291
   once the oil is soaked in,   

51
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,294
 he applies a smoothing solution
         onto the edges         

52
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:54,233
          and rubs them         
     with a piece of canvas.    

53
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,636
    now the sewing can begin.   

54
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,972
 he folds one end of the holster
     piece to form a pouch.     

55
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,043
 then, he sews inside the groove
    he cut for the main seam.   

56
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,179
   stitches sunken in a groove  

57
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,982
        are far stronger        
     than surface stitches.     

58
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:12,117
   when he completes the seam,  

59
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,587
     he burns the end of the    
polyester thread with a lighter.

60
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,190
  then, he sews on the toe plug 
      and inserts the pouch     

61
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,561
      into the double loops     
 at the other end of the piece. 

62
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,000
   next, he works on the belt.  

63
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:32,004
   after piercing stitch holes  
     in the main belt strip,    

64
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,639
      he sews on a thinner,     
         flexible strip,        

65
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,609
           bending it           
    into loops to hold ammo.    

66
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,257
  he glues on a leather lining  
 to make the belt more durable. 

67
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,366
  then, he sews on the billets. 

68
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:05,636
  they're the pieces that go on 
each end of the main belt strip.

69
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,439
   one billet has the buckle,   

70
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,175
        and the other has       
      the adjustment holes.     

71
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,512
 after applying some decorative 
  nickle studs known as spots,  

72
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:18,317
       he threads the belt      
     through the holster...     

73
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,556
    ...and inserts the ammo.    

74
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:31,263
   this double-loop holster is  
   a copy of an 1880s holster   

75
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,599
        designed to hold        
  a single-action army pistol.  

76
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,802
     the craftsman can make     

77
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,337
        several different       
 authentic styles from this era,

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,408
customizing the holster to carry
 a weapon of any size or shape. 

79
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,290
  narrator: from ocean wildlife 
         to shipwrecks,         

80
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,160
      the undersea world is     
          breathtaking.         

81
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,762
 many recreational scuba divers 

82
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,231
  want to capture what they see 
            on video.           

83
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,634
      they can do this with     
    an ordinary video camera,   

84
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:13,171
 encased in a specially designed
    watertight housing unit.    

85
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,246
     this underwater housing    
   has remote camera controls   

86
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,914
     and a built-in monitor     

87
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,717
         that shows you         
   what the video camera sees.  

88
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,929
         at the factory,        
   a computer-guided mill uses  

89
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:41,867
   a variety of bits to shape   
  a tube of extruded aluminum.  

90
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:46,338
the machine prepares the ends to
 receive front and back pieces. 

91
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,940
        it forms a groove       
       for a rubber o-ring      

92
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,475
        to keep water out       

93
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,743
   and makes attachment points  

94
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,046
          on each side          
   of the housing for handles.  

95
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,751
       then, the mill cuts      
    the front and back pieces   

96
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,154
 out of two blocks of aluminum. 

97
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,224
  the machining process leaves  
           tool marks,          

98
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,092
so they polish the housing parts

99
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,196
  by putting them in a tumbler  
     full of ceramic stones.    

100
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,635
       after about an hour      
 of rubbing against the stones, 

101
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:19,971
the aluminum is smooth and ready
         to be anodized.        

102
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:23,909
   this process etches, dyes,   
  and seals the metal surface,  

103
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,312
protecting it from the corrosive
     effects of salt water.     

104
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,316
  next, a computer-guided laser 

105
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,719
            etches in           
    the manufacturer's logo.    

106
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,889
        laser etching is        
 far more durable than printing 

107
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,125
       because it bleaches      
the black anodized surface white

108
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,596
 so the lettering can't rub off 
           over time.           

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,668
  several parts of the housing  
      are made of plastic.      

110
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,204
  workers pour plastic pellets  

111
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,473
    into an injection-molding   
            machine.            

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,275
 the machine melts the pellets, 

113
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,779
    then shoots the liquefied   
      plastic into a mold.      

114
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,553
     after about 15 seconds,    

115
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,623
   the machine opens the mold   
 and ejects a newly formed part.

116
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,360
      this part is a latch      
         that allows you        

117
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,096
       to open the housing      
    to insert a video camera.   

118
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,501
      the handles are made      
   of rubber-covered aluminum.  

119
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,703
             each of            
   its camera-control buttons   

120
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:28,440
     has an o-ring around it    
       to keep out water.       

121
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:32,109
   the controls are powered by  
      two lithium batteries     

122
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,914
         that sit inside        
 a separate sealed compartment. 

123
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,583
when you press a control button,

124
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,188
  the post underneath it makes  
contact with electronics inside.

125
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,989
this produces an infrared signal

126
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,791
        that communicates       
         with the camera        

127
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,261
   through tiny glass windows.  

128
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,198
   the back of the housing has  
     a built-in lcd monitor,    

129
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,101
         which displays         
      what the camera sees.     

130
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,577
both the monitor and camera plug
  into the same circuit board.  

131
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,486
       the handles fasten       
         to the housing         

132
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,489
      with a threaded ring.     

133
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,757
      there are also holes      
      on top of the housing     

134
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,127
for attaching a carrying handle.

135
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,232
   before attaching the front   
    and back of the housing,    

136
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,168
    they apply rubber o-rings   
       to keep water out.       

137
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,573
       then, they install       
        the flip filter.        

138
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,642
    it attaches magnetically    
           to a pivot           

139
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,444
  on the inside of the housing  

140
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,380
       and is operated by       
     an arm on the outside.     

141
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,115
    this filter is essential    

142
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,251
      because water absorbs     
   certain light wave lengths,  

143
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,521
  eliminating the appearance of 
 red, orange, yellow, and green,

144
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,458
  depending on how deep you go. 

145
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,127
     to restore these colors    
          in the video,         

146
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,865
 the diver flips the filter over
        the camera lens.        

147
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,667
 the factory tests every housing

148
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,936
          to make sure          
   it's completely watertight.  

149
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,673
       the tester inserts       
         a video camera         

150
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:12,477
    and submerges the housing   
     in a water-filled tank.    

151
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,880
     he pressurizes the tank    

152
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,415
           to simulate          
     the underwater pressure    

153
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:22,687
   the housing will experience  
  at a depth of about 300 feet. 

154
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,556
   the housing passes the test  

155
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,558
  only if all the seals hold up 

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,762
   and no water leaks inside,   
       ruining the camera.      

157
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,434
  in addition to a flip filter, 

158
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,771
  divers sometimes use lights   
  to counter the muting effect  

159
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,440
    that underwater depth has   
           on colors.           

160
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,909
         the housing has        
attachment points on the handles

161
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,444
      for mounting lights,      

162
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,246
    enabling the video camera   
           to capture           

163
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:52,150
     the true vivid colors      
     of the undersea world.     

164
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,528
     narrator: soy beverages    

165
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,731
       originated in china      
         centuries ago,         

166
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,268
 long before lactose intolerance
      and dairy allergies.      

167
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,937
            recently,           
      this dairy-free drink     

168
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,473
has become a popular alternative
            to milk,            

169
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,244
    allowing people to order    
 a latte, but hold the lactose. 

170
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,885
         it's not milk,         
   but it's a good substitute.  

171
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,955
   a soy beverage is made from  
      liquefied soy beans.      

172
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,825
 it has the look and consistency
         of animal milk,        

173
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,695
             but is             
 an entirely different product. 

174
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,299
 it starts with a specific kind 
           of soybean,          

175
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,034
          one that has          
      just the right amount     

176
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,103
  of protein and carbohydrates. 

177
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,973
   they harvest these soybeans  
    when the plants are dry.    

178
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,310
  less moisture means the beans 
 will be less prone to spoiling.

179
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:57,582
    they dehull the soybeans    
 and crack them into small bits.

180
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:01,119
  a lift carries the heavy bag  
          of bean bits          

181
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,722
           to a scale           
  to weigh them for processing. 

182
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,127
     the operator cuts open     
     the bottom of the bag,     

183
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,030
 releasing the cracked soybeans 
         into a hopper.         

184
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:20,205
  here, augers move the cracked 
 beans up to two large grinders.

185
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,743
 the system pipes in hot water, 

186
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,078
      and the grinders whip     
       the beans and water      

187
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,080
          into a creamy         
    soy-beverage concentrate.   

188
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,419
      the beverage travels      
   through steam-heated pipes.  

189
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:38,556
this kills off any bacteria that
  may have come from the field. 

190
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:43,094
then, it's into a vacuum chamber
         for a cooldown.        

191
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,297
    most of the manufacturing   
equipment is sealed from the air

192
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,932
    to prevent contamination.   

193
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,836
  the soy-beverage concentrate  

194
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,306
    leaves the vacuum chamber   
    and enters a centrifuge.    

195
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,643
        it spins out much       
 of the chunky insoluble fiber, 

196
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,312
        leaving smoother,       
         thinner liquid.        

197
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,984
        the soybean fiber       
        won't be wasted.        

198
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:10,454
it will be used in food products
        and animal feed.        

199
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,391
      the soy liquid flows      
      into a big blender.       

200
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,793
  they pipe in filtered water,  

201
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,864
       add refined sugar,       
        vanilla extract,        

202
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,534
   as well as various vitamins  
          and minerals.         

203
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,140
        he closes the lid       
     while the blender mixes    

204
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,543
         the ingredients        
   into a frothy soy beverage.  

205
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,747
     the soy beverage exits     
           the blender          

206
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,216
            and flows           
    into a huge storage tank,   

207
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,817
        where an agitator       

208
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,854
  keeps the various ingredients 
           well-mixed.          

209
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,691
    the tank is refrigerated    

210
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,960
    to preserve the beverage    
  while it's held for testing.  

211
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,431
   the operator takes a sample  
             to test            

212
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,135
 the consistency and nutritional
     value of the beverage.     

213
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,045
 with his approval, the beverage
   is released from the tanks.  

214
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,383
     it flows through pipes     
  injected with very hot steam. 

215
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,321
       this kills off any       
 microorganisms that may remain.

216
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,058
     after a quick cooling,     

217
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,395
        the soy beverage        
    goes into a homogenizer.    

218
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,798
     it pushes the beverage     
       through small holes      

219
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,467
     to break down the fat,     

220
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,202
        reducing the size       
        of the particles.       

221
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,272
  the soy beverage accumulates  

222
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,975
        in a sterile tank       
until it's ready to be packaged.

223
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,146
 the soy beverages are packaged 

224
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:45,950
     without any exposure to    
contaminants in the environment.

225
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,691
    the packaging material is   
made of a polyethylene laminate.

226
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,428
  machinery takes the laminate  
       up to a steel ring       

227
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,298
          that forms it         
      into a tubular shape.     

228
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,968
          hot jaws seal         
      the sides and bottom,     

229
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,171
  then inject the soy beverage  
        and seal the top.       

230
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,511
the cartons land on the conveyor
         on their side.         

231
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,415
      they're liquid-tight      
       so nothing spills.       

232
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,719
 then, a conveyor transfers them

233
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,456
      to a revolving wheel      
 that turns them right-side-up. 

234
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,725
   now that they are oriented   
           correctly,           

235
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,962
   they ride a windy conveyor   
      to a capping station.     

236
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,833
   plastic caps land on spouts  

237
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,535
      that have been molded     
        to the packages.        

238
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:43,274
 a system of rubber belts screw 
    the caps onto the spouts.   

239
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,113
   this packaging can preserve  
a soy beverage for up to a year.

240
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,886
      it probably won't be      
   on the shelf for that long   

241
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,021
       because someone is       
         always looking         

242
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,691
   for a dietary alternative.   

243
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,235
            narrator:           
 dogs and cats have round nails,

244
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,437
  while humans have flat ones.  

245
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,705
     special trimming tools     
       have been developed      

246
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,641
          to give them          
      the perfect pedicure.     

247
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,645
 guillotine-style clippers have 
    a hole for the pet's nail   

248
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,847
and a sliding blade that cuts it

249
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,917
     so the pet will be back    
     on its feet in no time.    

250
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,055
      long nails can damage     
       a dog's foot pads,       

251
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,924
     so they must be trimmed    
       from time to time.       

252
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,326
    pets usually don't like     
    having their nails done,    

253
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,062
 but a guillotine-style trimmer 

254
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,765
     can make the experience    
       less of an ordeal.       

255
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,400
     its sliding blade trims    
       their nails quickly      

256
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,903
          so it's over          
      before they know it.      

257
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,408
 production of guillotine-style 
        pet-nail trimmers       

258
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,344
  starts with a feeder system.  

259
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,612
        the feeder system       

260
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,949
    uncoils a strip of steel    
       into a punch press.      

261
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,786
       the press cuts out       
   two handle blanks at once.   

262
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,292
       it also makes holes      
     for screws and rivets,     

263
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,227
 as well as a hook for a spring.

264
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,899
a second press rounds the handle
   to make it easier to grip.   

265
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,474
     here is a large handle     
  before and after the shaping. 

266
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,112
       the handle now goes      
       into a third press.      

267
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:33,718
 this one folds the tabs down to
 create a pocket for the blades.

268
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,655
        here is a handle        
 before and after this forming. 

269
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:43,528
  next, a narrow strip of steel 
      unwinds into a press.     

270
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,865
  the press cuts and shapes it  
  into the main sliding blade.  

271
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:52,069
the half-moon-shaped end will be
        the cutting edge.       

272
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,073
   a worker slides the blades   
           onto a rack          

273
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,742
     with the half-moon edge    
        facing downward.        

274
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,679
      this makes it easier      

275
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,149
       to load the blades       
    into a grinding fixture.    

276
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:09,753
   she places two in each slot  
  with the half-moon facing up. 

277
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,158
  a carriage moves the fixture  
         back and forth         

278
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,093
     under a grinding stone.    

279
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,163
    it grinds the entire row    
       of blades at once.       

280
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,667
 this improves the strength and 
 sharpness of the cutting edge. 

281
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,437
    she inspects every blade    
           to confirm           

282
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,108
  that each one has been ground 
     to the correct profile.    

283
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,512
     on the left is a blade     
         before grinding        

284
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:39,383
 and on the right is one after. 

285
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,520
       she dips the blades      
     in a cleaning solution     

286
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,122
        and rinses them.        

287
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,460
      this cleaning removes     

288
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,797
     lubricating-oil residue    
       and metal filings.       

289
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,004
    she transfers the blades    
      to a perforated tray.     

290
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,408
    she spreads them evenly,    
  switches on an overhead fan,  

291
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,078
     and leaves them to dry     
      for several minutes.      

292
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,616
     heat treatment hardens     
           the blades,          

293
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,084
  and polishing finishes them.  

294
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,887
 next up is the retainer blade. 

295
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,490
   it's the one with the hole   
          for the nail.         

296
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:24,195
she arranges the circular blades
      on a magnetized tray.     

297
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,699
  the blades cling to the tray  

298
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,036
    as a carriage moves them    
 back and forth under a grinder.

299
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,307
      the grinding sharpens     
     the front of the blades    

300
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,910
        and removes scale       
    left by a heat treatment.   

301
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:48,552
   this is the retainer blade   
   before and after grinding.   

302
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,588
   the pet-nail-trimmer parts   
     are ready for assembly.    

303
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,592
the employee rivets a metal link

304
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,461
     for the sliding blade      
     to the smaller handle.     

305
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,333
    once the parts have been    
         chrome-plated,         

306
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,103
 another worker hinges the large
   handle to the smaller one.   

307
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,675
  he hooks one end of a spring  
       to the metal link.       

308
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,412
  he inserts the sliding blade  

309
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,013
         into the track         
      in the large handle,      

310
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,684
   lifting the link to hook it  
         into the blade.        

311
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,088
             he adds            
  the circular retainer blade.  

312
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,556
     he places a metal plate    
         over the track         

313
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,292
     and screws it in place.    

314
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,960
   this secures the top blade,  

315
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,564
 while allowing the link to move
       the sliding blade.       

316
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,233
     he hooks the other end     
          of the spring         

317
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,668
      to the larger handle      

318
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,837
            and bends           
   the circular blade slightly  

319
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,172
 to give it the correct profile.

320
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:46,576
 now a worker tests the trimmer 
     on dried buffalo hide.     

321
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,112
      dried buffalo hide is     
     tougher than pet nails.    

322
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,849
with his okay, this cutting tool

323
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,585
 is ready for the paws and claws
     for our furry friends.     

324
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,923
 the main blade can be replaced 
       if it becomes dull,      

325
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,658
           which means          
      this pet-nail trimmer     

326
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,294
           can be used          
     for many years to come.    

327
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,672
