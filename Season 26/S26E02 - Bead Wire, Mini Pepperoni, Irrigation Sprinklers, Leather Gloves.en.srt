00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,987
narrator: the bead is the lip of the tire              

4
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,856
that fits to a wheel rim.    

5
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,192
high-tensile steel wires inside the bead         

6
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:05,731
pull the tire tightly and uniformly to the rim.    

7
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,267
these bead wires provide stability        

8
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,536
so the wheels can start turning.            

9
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,608
these bronze-coated steel wires              

10
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,278
are the muscle in the bead of a tire.      

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,879
they're a source of hidden strength        

12
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,015
that we don't usually think about.    

13
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:26,819
but without them, tires wouldn't properly grip the rim,              

14
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,689
and riding on wheels would be dangerous.       

15
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:38,764
production starts with coils of high-carbon steel.      

16
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:43,568
a forklift slides the coils onto metal cones.        

17
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,773
a worker cuts the ties around the wire.         

18
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,842
then the cone moves into an upright position     

19
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,110
on the carousel.         

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,646
a motorized system        

21
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,582
uncoils the wire and pulls it up through the cone.        

22
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,120
at the top,           

23
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:05,925
a guide positions the wire to enter a descaler.       

24
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,994
the device           
has a revolving sandpaper belt  

25
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,430
which smoothes and refines the wire.            

26
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,936
next, the wire travels      

27
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,071
through a channel filled with powdered soap,    

28
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:21,674
which acts as a dry lubricant.  

29
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:26,012
then, the system pulls the wire through a series of dies,    

30
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:28,748
each with progressively smaller openings.            

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,820
the process is called drawing  

32
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,423
because it draws        
down the diameter of the wire,  

33
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,626
stretching it longer and thinner.           

34
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,764
the process reduces the wire's diameter by almost half.     

35
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,433
a carriage lifts the thinner wire      

36
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,503
onto a spool that winds it up.  

37
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,708
the table the spool sits on turns          

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,377
to deliver the wire to the next operation.      

39
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,049
the spool of wire is one of 40  

40
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,953
that now unwind simultaneously at a controlled speed.      

41
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,793
large cones keep them separate  

42
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,529
so they'll be ready for the next stage        

43
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,965
of the journey --        

44
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,034
a trip through a long oven.   

45
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:31,610
it's heated to an incredible 1,800 degrees.            

46
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,749
inside, intense heat       

47
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,818
recrystalizes the microstructure of the wires.          

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,889
this reduces brittleness.    

49
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,292
then spools take up the wires.  

50
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,228
the wires take a dip in a tank  

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,199
filled with hot water and phosphate solution.     

52
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:59,872
a floating foam blanket keeps the solution hot.     

53
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,777
the phosphate solution and a subsequent rinse lubricate            

54
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:07,780
the bead wire for the next process --     

55
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,248
a second drawing         

56
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,951
that squeezes the wire even longer and narrower.    

57
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,989
the holes in a series of dies become progressively narrower  

58
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,394
to reduce the wire's diameter even further.          

59
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,330
after each trip through a die,  

60
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,531
a drum winds up the wire.    

61
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:31,604
each drum turns a little    
faster than the one before it.  

62
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,539
that's because longer wires   

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,509
need to be wound up quicker to prevent slack in the system.             

64
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,080
this final drawing process    

65
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:46,218
brings the wire's diameter down to less than 1 millimeter.           

66
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,390
the bead wires are now at the correct width.  

67
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,766
next, the bead wires receive their bronze coating.  

68
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,234
bronzing the steel wires     

69
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,037
allows them to adhere to the tire rubber.       

70
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,042
after the bronze solution dries,             

71
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,444
two rollers straighten the wires.      

72
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,384
then a spool winds up the bead wire.     

73
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,719
they produce bead wire in different thicknesses     

74
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,256
and metal coatings for a variety of tire sizes.   

75
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,730
they test the wires       
before they leave the factory.  

76
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,466
if it can withstand up to 1,500 pounds of force     

77
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,401
before it breaks,        

78
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,171
then it's ready to be shipped to the tire factory.       

79
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,343
once they're installed in rubber tires,         

80
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,810
these bead wires will be     

81
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,681
an important source of strength, doing their part  

82
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,650
to keep your vehicle moving forward safely.      

83
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,169
narrator: mini pepperoni makes a great portable snack.  

84
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,838
it's made of red meat or poultry.           

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,172
this protein-packed snack    

86
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,577
can alleviate even the most serious hunger pains.      

87
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,914
the meat sticks are fermented and dehydrated,  

88
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,283
so they don't need to be refrigerated.       

89
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,724
this brand of mini pepperoni is made entirely of pork.    

90
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,327
it comes in a variety of flavors,     

91
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,131
each made with different seasonings.    

92
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,134
first, they prepare the raw meat.    

93
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,203
they combine different cuts in specific proportions     

94
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,173
to attain their target meat-to-fat ratio.             

95
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:54,046
the meat comes from the pig's back, shoulder, and belly.    

96
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,525
the butcher loads the pork into an automated grinder.    

97
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,829
it grinds the pork        

98
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,065
until it's the right texture for mini pepperoni.       

99
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,236
the meat was frozen,       

100
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,507
then partially thawed before entering the machine.   

101
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,978
as a result, the pork grinds cleanly.     

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,849
the seasoning recipe includes paprika, cayenne pepper,     

103
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,119
dextrose, anise, and salt.    

104
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,121
they also mix in sodium nitrate,            

105
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,456
a preservative         
that prevents bacterial growth  

106
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,661
and gives the meat a cured flavor.         

107
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,263
they load the ground pork into a mixer           

108
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:49,000
and pour in some lactic acid bacterial culture,        

109
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,137
which will kick-start fermentation later.       

110
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,006
next, they add the seasoning mix               

111
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:58,810
and a premeasured amount of concentrated liquid paprika.            

112
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,346
they continue mixing for a couple of minutes,     

113
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,882
distributing the ingredients evenly.             

114
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,490
then they transfer the ground pork from the mixer       

115
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,058
to a meat buggy.         

116
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,866
they roll the meat buggy over to the filling machine...    

117
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,038
...and empty the contents.    

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,640
a worker loads a tube of sausage casing.        

119
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:34,179
the casing is made of bovine collagen.       

120
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:38,650
the filling machine pumps out 1.6 ounces of ground pork  

121
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,920
then twists the casing between each one to form a link.              

122
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,867
the machine feeds 25-link chains onto a hanging line.       

123
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,668
the line spaces them out to preserve           

124
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,871
their perfect sausage shape.   

125
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,043
one casing tube makes 100 links.             

126
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,784
next, they ferment, smoke, and dry the meat.        

127
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:20,926
workers hang three dozen 25-link chains on each smokehouse rack.              

128
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,832
then they roll the rack into the smokehouse.       

129
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,167
first, they humidify and heat the links        

130
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,837
to approximately 77 degrees, triggering fermentation.     

131
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,106
the lactic acid bacterial culture        

132
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:39,177
starts feeding on the dextrose in the seasoning.        

133
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,048
the process increases the acidity in the meat,     

134
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,250
preventing harmful bacteria from growing.          

135
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,886
it also produces a fermented flavor.             

136
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,993
after about 14 hours, they lower the temperature    

137
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,329
and humidity to halt fermentation.      

138
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,064
next, they start up the smoke generator,       

139
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,335
which they've loaded with maple and beechwood chips.             

140
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:07,539
they run several smoking cycles until the links change color   

141
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:12,144
and acquire a slightly sweet and smoky taste.         

142
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:15,714
then they raise the heat again to cook the meat thoroughly.   

143
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,486
finally, they dry the links in a temperature         

144
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,690
and humidity-controlled room for a couple of days.      

145
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,761
workers separate the links    

146
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:34,365
and put 10 into the bottom of each tray.          

147
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,502
the trays go          
into a vacuum-packing machine,  

148
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:41,273
which sucks out the air then seals the top with plastic.            

149
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:50,516
the pepperoni is tested by an  
in-house lab before packaging.  

150
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:55,186
they confirm that the moisture content is sufficiently low   

151
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,923
and the acidity reading is sufficiently high.      

152
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:02,194
if it is, the final product is considered shelf-stable,   

153
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,395
meaning that it isn't perishable           

154
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,166
and doesn't require refrigeration.          

155
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,551
narrator: where mother nature fails,    

156
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,288
a center-pivot irrigation system can succeed.           

157
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,290
if you can't afford to wait on the rain,       

158
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,260
these systems can water your crops.      

159
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,095
they're essentially a huge sprinkler         

160
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,898
on wheels that pivots around a central point      

161
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,034
in a slow, circular path.    

162
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,572
developed in the 20th century,  

163
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:51,776
center-pivot sprinklers have become a staple on large farms.             

164
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,712
they can be up to a half-mile in length            

165
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,248
and sprawl across fields,    

166
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,850
ensuring there isn't a dry spot in sight.            

167
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,122
they custom-design each sprinkler for the field   

168
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,857
it will be irrigating.      

169
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:10,528
then, they transform flat, high-strength steel       

170
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:14,933
into a water pipe for the sprinkler system.    

171
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,335
the steel travels        

172
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:20,072
between forming tools and then a series of rollers.  

173
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,610
they curve the steel upwards, taking it from flat       

174
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,279
to cylindrical.         

175
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,953
more rollers squeeze the pipe to close the gap.        

176
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,056
then an automated induction welder can fuse the joint.    

177
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:44,630
a carbide blade trims excess metal from the welded seam.   

178
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:49,501
the metal is collected on a spool to be recycled.    

179
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:53,305
next, they douse the pipe with coolant.          

180
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,640
a plasma torch then moves along the pipe    

181
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,043
to cut it into 40-foot sections.            

182
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,781
the pipes fall off the cutting line and roll    

183
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,383
into a holding area.       

184
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,121
after the pipes         
have been inspected for flaws,  

185
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,057
a team clamps flanges to the ends.           

186
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,527
these flanges will be used to link the water pipes     

187
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,662
in the field.          

188
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,265
they weld the flanges to the pipes.          

189
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,537
next, the welder uses a plasma torch to cut    

190
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,740
outlets for sprinkler heads.   

191
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:32,878
he welds a threaded fitting onto each outlet.        

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,480
the water pipe is complete.   

193
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,081
they'll use dozens of these pipes          

194
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,017
for a single irrigation system.             

195
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,356
next, a progressive die stamps hook plates from steel.     

196
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,426
hook plates hold the spans of the sprinkler together.    

197
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:51,763
they also keep the sprinkler flexible as it moves.      

198
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,567
robots weld mounting plates and other parts to a pipe,    

199
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,035
creating a base for the sprinkler        

200
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,071
system's wheeled towers.     

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,382
then they dip all the parts in molten zinc.         

202
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,452
the zinc hardens as it cools to give the pipes  

203
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:18,390
a glossy, rust-proof finish.   

204
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:21,793
next, an employee        
assembles the sprinkler heads.  

205
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,328
she screws a weight to the plastic sprinkler body  

206
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,532
to stabilize it.         

207
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,734
then she snaps on a spray nozzle.         

208
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,069
the nozzles come in various sizes         

209
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,407
for different applications.   

210
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,543
finally,            
she adds a pressure regulator.  

211
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,681
the next member of the team   

212
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,284
lubricates the wheel rims with soapy water.        

213
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,720
then he installs the rubber tires.              

214
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,890
the tire size and tread     

215
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,828
are selected based on expected field conditions.  

216
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,296
these tires           

217
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,066
should allow the sprinkler system to rotate freely.     

218
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,439
they ship the parts of the sprinkler system     

219
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,509
to the field.          

220
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,377
they arrange the pipes on the ground          

221
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,379
in the correct configuration...        

222
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,251
...and set all the structural components beside them.     

223
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,388
then they start assembling the immense sprinkler system,  

224
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,727
beginning with the triangular supports for the water pipes.  

225
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,930
they hoist the ends of two pipes onto the supports        

226
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,000
and bolt them at the flanges.  

227
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,201
they repeat this process until the structure       

228
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,405
stretches across the field.   

229
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,810
a crew member screws the sprinklers to hoses.     

230
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,011
he connects the hoses to u-shaped fittings       

231
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,780
screwed into the pipes.     

232
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,753
next, they complete the electrical wiring.             

233
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,289
then they roll the wheels to the end towers        

234
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,059
and bolt them to the gear motor hubs.     

235
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,766
it takes a full day to assemble a center-pivot sprinkler system             

236
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:11,369
in the field.          

237
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,705
by tapping into an underground source,   

238
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:17,442
the system can pump out water through the sprinkler heads.   

239
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,978
during a drought, this irrigation system      

240
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,049
can provide a long, cold drink 
for crops on a hot summer day.  

241
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,336
narrator: gloves have long been a part of human history.     

242
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,670
up until the middle ages,    

243
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,872
most people ate with their hands.      

244
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,474
so, ancient romans wore silk or linen gloves         

245
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,144
to protect their hands from hot food.          

246
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,214
today, leather gloves are    
mainly used to provide warmth,  

247
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,251
but they can also make a fashion statement.    

248
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,359
these gloves are made of high-quality lambskin.    

249
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,295
the tanneries process the hides to make the leather smooth,   

250
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,764
supple, and very durable.    

251
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:17,168
the gloves are then handcrafted in france.            

252
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,437
making a fine pair of leather gloves        

253
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,506
starts with a master glove-cutter.          

254
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,841
cutting expertise is just as important       

255
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,044
as the quality of leather they use.       

256
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:33,251
first, he adds water to make the leather supple.   

257
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:37,389
then he stretches the skin in a single direction.      

258
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,191
this prevents the glove from stretching and losing its shape              

259
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,893
after it's made.         

260
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,932
he uses a rectangular template  

261
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,602
to make indentations in the leather,         

262
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:54,205
then cuts them with shears.   

263
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:58,610
he produces two rectangles, one for each glove in the pair.              

264
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,949
he stretches the leather again.             

265
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,218
a master glove-cutter knows how to optimize      

266
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,021
the natural stretch in the skin.              

267
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,157
he deliberately leaves room in certain areas         

268
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,291
for comfort and eliminates    

269
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,162
stretch in other areas to preserve the glove's fit.   

270
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,536
using the template again, he marks and makes his final cuts.              

271
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,973
the rectangle is for the section of the glove           

272
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,242
that covers the hand, called the trank.        

273
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,921
he marks the glove size with a white pencil.       

274
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,995
he follows the same procedure to cut pieces of leather     

275
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,131
for the other parts of the glove.          

276
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,366
they include the thumb,     

277
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,401
the pieces           
that go in between the fingers  

278
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:57,869
called the fourchettes,     

279
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,204
and the decorative trim.     

280
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,741
he uses a die to cut each part.              

281
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,478
there's a separate die for each part of every glove model.             

282
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,347
there's also a different die for each size.          

283
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,351
the cutter places a few pieces into a trank die.        

284
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,887
then, he covers the leather with a resin block        

285
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,423
to prevent damage from the press.         

286
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,759
the press quickly cuts the pieces.     

287
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,096
then, all the cut pieces are  
sent to the sewing department.  

288
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:31,502
the head seamstress makes a paper pattern.      

289
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,905
this model has three rows of stitching           

290
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,042
and three circular openings on the back of the hand.     

291
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,117
she places the pattern on the leather          

292
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,256
then uses talc to transfer the design.     

293
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,998
she uses specialized tools to punch out the openings    

294
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,769
and perforate the stitch holes.             

295
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,747
then another seamstress sews the glove together.     

296
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:22,153
she starts with the three rows of decorative stitching.     

297
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,355
they form three raised lines   

298
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:29,093
and stretch the round openings into ovals.           

299
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,163
the rest of the glove is machine-sewn.         

300
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,899
the seamstress turns the trank inside out            

301
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,769
and stitches the fourchettes to the fingers.         

302
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:42,840
then she sews on the thumb and the trim on the cuff.    

303
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,777
she finishes off the cuff with an engraved rivet.     

304
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,248
another seamstress        

305
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,319
attaches a silk jersey lining to the inside of the glove.   

306
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,055
there are also linings made of cashmere, wool,     

307
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,124
fur, and polar fleece.      

308
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:05,396
she hand stitches the lining to               
the leather in each fingertip.  

309
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,531
she turns the glove right-side out,         

310
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:11,269
using a wooden tool to gently push out the fingers.            

311
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:18,276
a final seamstress slips the  
gloves onto heated hand forms.  

312
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,411
she rubs the leather with a downward motion      

313
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,081
to manually iron out all the wrinkles.        

314
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:28,953
the packager wears a pair of cotton gloves to ensure    

315
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,722
the leather remains pristine.  

316
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,692
these leather gloves       

317
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,695
were artisan-crafted using century-old techniques   

318
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,899
and nothing more advanced than a simple sewing machine.  

319
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,603
now they're ready to stylishly warm up even the coldest hands.
