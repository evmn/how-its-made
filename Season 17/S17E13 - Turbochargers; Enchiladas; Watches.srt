482
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,446
goes off to be tested for       
water-resistance.               
if it passes, it comes back to  

483
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,913
water-resistance.               
if it passes, it comes back to  
the watchmaker to receive the

he removes the crown and the    
case back, cleans the movement, 

487
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:47,158
he removes the crown and the

then places it in the case.     

488
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,660
case back, cleans the movement, 
then places it in the case.     
next, he squirts grease in the

00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,595
then places it in the case.     
next, he squirts grease in the

this time, because the movement 
is in place, the crown stem     
connects to the two springs so  

494
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,602
is in place, the crown stem     
connects to the two springs so

several tiny clamps and screws. 

499
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,482
movement in the case with       
several tiny clamps and screws. 
then he closes up the back for  

500
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:17,755

for water-resistance, they first

00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,103
water-resistance.               
for water-resistance, they first
test using air pressure.

00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,772
for water-resistance, they first
test using air pressure.        
then actual water tests.        

537
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,374
test using air pressure.        
then actual water tests.        
first a low-pressure test in    

538
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:47,212
then actual water tests.        
first a low-pressure test in    
four inches of water.           

539
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,947
then a high-pressure test in 410

00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,049
yards of water which far exceeds

541
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,519
the 328-yard depth to which the 

542

finally it's time to assemble   

545
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,797
and attach the watch strap,
