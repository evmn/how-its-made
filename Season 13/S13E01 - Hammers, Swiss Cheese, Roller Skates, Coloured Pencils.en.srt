00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,986
narrator: the need to hammer things   

2
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,055
goes back to prehistoric times 

3
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,858
when early man used stones as tools.     

4
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,726
the modern hammer evolved   

5
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,661
from those first crude implements.       

6
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,331
but with its forged-steel design
and user-friendly handle,   

7
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,168
the hammer of today is strikingly different.    

8
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,410
no one-hit wonder,       

9
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,878
the modern hammer is made to endure.       

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,348
it maintains its structural integrity    

11
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,817
despite repeated pounding and pulling.          

12
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,219
it starts with a thick steel bar.    

13
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,889
an automated system loads it into an induction furnace   

14
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,092
set at more than 1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

15
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,295
the fierce heat makes the steel malleable.   

16
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,865
this forge-hammer pounds the hot steel      

17
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,868
into a series of hammer-shaped compressions. 

18
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,105
then it's into a punch cutter 

19
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:49,241
which trims the ragged edges of the forged steel.      

20
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,877
the cutoffs go into a bin for recycling.         

21
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,782
a worker sandwiches the newly trimmed shape    

22
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,418
in a press that fine-tunes the shape.   

23
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,889
the hammer is cooled down on this revolving rack.    

24
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,928
then they load the hammers into a tumbler,        

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,063
along with tiny bits of steel --

26
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,998
so tiny, they're hard to see. 

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,668
but their impact will be very noticeable.    

28
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,269
as they toss about,      

29
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,073
the bits rub off scale and debris on the hammers,   

30
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,142
for an impressive cleanup.   

31
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,745
they then clamp the hammer in a device          

32
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:28,347
that spins it against abrasive belts     

33
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,282
to contour the striking head. 

34
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,285
these belts also bevel the hammer's head.       

35
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,287
it's a safety feature.     

36
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,457
the sloped edge is less likely to chip nails on impact.    

37
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,560
now this jagged cutting wheel 

38
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,763
carves ridges into the hammer's head.    

39
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,166
the device repositions the hammer     

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,170
so the wheel can cut it in a different direction    

41
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,705
to create a grid.       

42
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:56,509
this surface is less likely to slip off nails on impact.  

43
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,046
next comes the tempering process.     

44
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,082
the hammers plunge into a very hot bath.     

45
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,119
then they dip them in quenching oil,        

46
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,455
which cools the metal so quickly, it hardens.    

47
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,325
now it's time for another polish.      

48
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,527
this one makes the steal gleam.

49
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,329
it's the finishing touch.   

50
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,000
next, they assemble leather rings in a tray --   

51
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,135
25 to each one.        

52
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,871
they place plastic rings at each end          

53
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,272
to break up the look      

54
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,209
and buttress it with a pronged metal disk.   

55
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,011
they slide the tray into a compartment       

56
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,215
and insert the end of the hammer
in the rings.         

57
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,018
a hydraulic tool rams it through them,     

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,554
encasing the handle in a neat wrap         

59
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,556
that's comfortable to grasp.  

60
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,495
they secure the end of the hammer in a clamp,   

61
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,764
and then a spinning tool flattens the prongs      

62
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,566
that protrude from the metal plate,     

63
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,770
riveting it to the leather wrap.

64
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,372
then, using a series of sanding belts,       

65
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,776
they smooth the rough leather for a seamless finish.     

66
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,782
this is a tank of heavy lacquer

67
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,318
in which they immerse the hammers repeatedly.    

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,252
when it dries,         

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,987
the lacquer will give the leather wrap   

70
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,523
a tough, sleek finish,     

71
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,125
and the leather will look like one textured piece       

72
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,160
instead of many.        

73
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,337
for a different kind of handle,

74
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,006
they pour liquid vinyl on the hammer shaft      

75
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,074
that's encased in a mold.   

76
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:39,411
the vinyl adheres to the hammer
as it hardens.         

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
the mold leaves a dimpling impression     

78
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,586
that will make the hammer easier to grip.        

79
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,957
they grind off the hardened vinyl spillover  

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,425
and contour the handle.    

81
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,428
these handles are preferred by some tradesmen       

82
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,265
because the vinyl is an antishock material.   

83
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:05,037
they stamp the model number onto it.            

84
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,573
paint guns mist the steel with lacquer          

85
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,108
for a little rustproofing.   

86
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,247
the hammers then travel through an oven,        

87
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,316
which cures the lacquer.    

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,591
after they stamp        
the company logo onto the vinyl,

89
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,593
each hammer is visually inspected.     

90
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:31,129
only then does it get a seal of approval.      

91
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,133
it takes about a day to make a hammer,       

92
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,535
and with the different handle wraps and sizes,    

93
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:48,948
they've really nailed it.   

94
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,557
narrator: the swiss call this cheese "fromage d'alpage,"

95
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,627
which means "cheese from the high-mountain pastures."  

96
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,296
master cheesemakers retreat to their chalets    

97
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,432
high in the swiss alps to make this special cheese.  

98
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,635
these individuals follow a tradition of cheesemaking  

99
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,805
that goes back to the middle ages.      

100
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,446
fromage d'alpage is produced by cheesemakers        

101
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:25,050
who bring their cows high   
into the alps for five months --

102
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,620
to this region of gstaad, switzerland.    

103
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,726
in the morning, they milk their
cows for about seven minutes  

104
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,162
using an automatic milking machine.        

105
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,868
each cow produces around 2 1/2 gallons of milk, 

106
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,038
which contains water, protein, and fat.       

107
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:55,547
12 hours later, he removes the fat,      

108
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,449
which rises to the surface.  

109
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,688
he adds a starter culture,   

110
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,790
which helps preserve the milk. 

111
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,895
a wood fire then heats the milk
for 20 minutes         

112
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,399
at a constant 86 degrees fahrenheit.     

113
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,838
he then adds an enzyme called rennet         

114
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,341
and more starter culture to the milk.          

115
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,845
after about 40 minutes, these active ingredients    

116
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,481
coagulate the milk into cheese curd.        

117
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,922
he cuts the solidifying curd into smaller pieces.      

118
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,128
to maintain an even heat,   

119
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,332
he keeps blending the curd and the liquid together.    

120
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:50,535
he continues mixing and cutting the curd      

121
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,271
until the active ingredients  

122
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,406
separate the curd from the liquid,        

123
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,542
called whey.          

124
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,610
to make cheese,        

125
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,347
he will use only the grains of curd.    

126
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,952
an electric mixer then completes the separation. 

127
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,293
he washes his arms and hands thoroughly,     

128
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,463
because any impurities in the cheese would ruin it.  

129
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,434
after heating the mixture for 20 minutes again,     

130
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,369
the curd is now the perfect texture      

131
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,105
for making cheese.       

132
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,310
using cheesecloth,       

133
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,912
they remove the grains of curd.

134
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,116
what started out as 80 gallons of milk     

135
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:40,886
will end up producing only 66 pounds of cheese.   

136
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,797
the cheesemaker stuffs the sack
of curd into a mold      

137
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,665
and works out some of the whey.

138
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,805
he then puts three molds filled with curd  

139
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,140
into a wooden press.      

140
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,541
and using a wooden block    

141
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,943
that distributes the pressure evenly,      

142
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,179
he squeezes out more of the whey.       

143
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,822
to get all the excess liquid out of the curd,        

144
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,691
he turns each 22-pound piece of cheese over         

145
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,693
so he can press it again.   

146
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,999
too much liquid in the cheese 

147
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,301
would affect its shape and quality,          

148
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,036
so he does this a few times,  

149
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,372
then leaves them in the press overnight.    

150
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,117
the next morning, he trims off the excess cheese 

151
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,987
created around the edge by the pressing mold.     

152
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,390
like every step in this cheesemaking process, 

153
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,659
this work is also done by hand.

154
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,066
he soaks the cheese in salt water for 24 hours   

155
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:05,170
to conserve, harden, and intensify its taste.    

156
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,811
the cheese then goes through a salting and maturing process 

157
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,013
that lasts six months.     

158
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,885
during this time, they flip each piece of cheese often   

159
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,420
so it ages evenly.       

160
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,895
after a final surface cleaning,

161
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,699
they put the 22-pound pieces on their sides to air-dry.   

162
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:37,069
they'll remain edible for at least 10 years.     

163
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,906
but, of course, you don't have to live in the alps    

164
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:44,776
to enjoy the taste of swiss cheese.        

165
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,592
narrator: when roller skates were invented by the dutch   

166
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,593
in the 18th century,      

167
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,929
they put a whole new spin on skating.          

168
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:07,199
before that, people could only skate on iced surfaces,  

169
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,335
so the sport had definite seasonal limitations.     

170
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,471
the wheels of those first roller skates  

171
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,471
were wooden spools.      

172
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,806
but today's manufacturers   

173
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,376
have come up with some better tricks to make them.  

174
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,281
roller skates have improved by leaps and bounds.      

175
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:27,019
the wheels are made of strong, lightweight polyurethane,   

176
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,454
so there's nothing to hold you back.        

177
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,492
they start with the shoes.   

178
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,095
a die press punches out leather patterns,       

179
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,297
called quarters --       

180
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,965
four per shoe.         

181
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,367
they place one quarter under a foil strip,      

182
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,835
and a hot die stamps it    

183
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,772
with the manufacturer's trademark.           

184
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:49,507
then, using a template,    

185
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,842
they mark the locations    

186
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,844
where components are to be sewn...       

187
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,449
...such as these racing stripes.

188
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,185
they stitch them onto the leather quarters   

189
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,153
in two rows.          

190
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,258
the four leather quarters have been partially pieced together.

191
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,661
here, the operator finishes the job,        

192
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,531
sewing the shoe's outer layer to the liner.         

193
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,340
she then stitches the rest of the liner to the shoe,    

194
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,343
while a little blade on the machine         

195
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:27,078
trims the excess leather.   

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,148
now the roller-skate shoe really takes shape,      

197
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,752
as she folds the leather in two
and sews the toe.       

198
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,154
this machine punches holes   

199
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,057
and inserts eyelets for the shoelaces.       

200
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,965
this machine, called a laster, 

201
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,033
glues the shoe to an insole.  

202
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,304
they insert a shoe and insole together      

203
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:53,705
into the laster.        

204
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,908
its nozzles coat the toe of the insole with cement   

205
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,778
while pinchers pull the leather around it.  

206
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,315
then automated arms press the leather onto the insole,  

207
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,717
bonding them together.     

208
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,320
another machine then nails   

209
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,722
the rest of the shoe around the insole,       

210
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:14,258
and a worker pounds them in further.    

211
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,861
a final laster         

212
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,197
folds the edge of the shoe around the heel  

213
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,300
and then drives nails into it. 

214
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,008
the hot lights of this machine activate cement        

215
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,412
that's been applied      
to an outsole and the shoe body.

216
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:37,282
this allows the two to adhere. 

217
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,818
as the cement dries,      

218
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,087
this hydraulic machine presses the outsole to the shoe

219
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,356
to aid the adhesion.      

220
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,297
they stitch the outsole to the shoe for reinforcement. 

221
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,499
after all, roller-skate shoes 

222
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,835
have to hold up to the rigors of the sport.         

223
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,037
they insert nails into holes  

224
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,640
of this heel-attaching machine...   

225
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:05,243
then position a fiberboard and leather heel on it,    

226
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,779
followed by the roller-skate shoe.     

227
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,716
mechanical drivers thrust the nails up into the shoe,  

228
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,385
firmly attaching the heel.   

229
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:16,187
an operator then forces the rubber sole        

230
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,856
against a circular cutter   

231
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,158
to remove the excess material. 

232
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,063
next, they screw a polyurethane toe stop    

233
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,465
into a skate frame.      

234
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,736
they drill through holes in the frame          

235
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,539
to make corresponding holes in the shoe.          

236
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,809
they push bolts into the holes.

237
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,545
then, using a pneumatic socket wrench,         

238
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,714
they bolt the skate frame to the shoe.          

239
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,953
the bolts are too long, so they cut them down to size 

240
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,888
with a special breakoff tool. 

241
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,560
they slide polyurethane cushions
onto kingpins,         

242
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,064
then install bearings in the hub of each wheel.   

243
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,236
a carousel conveyor delivers the wheel and bearings

244
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,774
to a tool that presses them together.  

245
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,044
with the wheels now linked by axles,      

246
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,515
these skates are almost ready to roll.   

247
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:19,317
they mount each wheel assembly on a kingpin,         

248
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,586
then install a second cushion ring.     

249
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,256
these cushions can be adjusted by the skater         

250
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,992
to change the feel of the skate.

251
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:30,695
a tweak to the axle      
confirms the wheels spin freely.

252
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,300
it takes about four days    

253
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,671
for the experts to make a pair of roller skates.    

254
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,474
that's somewhat less time than it takes         

255
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:46,011
for the average person to master using them.      

256
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,296
narrator: colored pencils come in basic color packages  

257
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,763
for schoolchildren,      

258
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,700
upgraded sets for architects and other professionals,    

259
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,968
and elaborate collections of shades           

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,370
for the serious artist.    

261
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,506
it isn't so much the color variety       

262
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,241
that determines the quality,  

263
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,743
but the pigment concentration in the lead.          

264
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,917
the core of a colored pencil  

265
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,386
doesn't actually contain any lead.           

266
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,957
it's composed of pigments, minerals, and binding agents. 

267
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,729
this company invented     
a unique type of colored pencil.

268
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,599
the lead composition is such that it allows you       

269
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,202
to brush on a bit of water after you draw         

270
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,938
to create the effect of watercolor paints.     

271
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,947
colored pencils start with a combination of pigments.

272
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,050
every shade has a specific pigment recipe.        

273
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,221
they produce a large quantity of one shade at a time.    

274
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,291
following that color's recipe, 

275
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,826
they meticulously weigh    

276
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,128
the different portions of ingredients.        

277
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:22,574
then they boil a specific quantity of water and additives

278
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,642
and add binding agents --   

279
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,480
a secret blend of gums, resins, or waxes.       

280
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,590
the ingredients expand in hot water,         

281
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,659
forming a paste.        

282
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:44,729
workers then mix the pigments into this paste.        

283
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:53,271
the next machine processes the paste into fine chunks,  

284
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,607
intensifying the color.    

285
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,475
the chunks move by conveyor belt

286
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,677
with a cylinder that compresses them,     

287
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,147
then feeds them into an extrusion machine.   

288
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,353
the extruder squeezes the paste
in a continuous stream     

289
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,456
that's the diameter of the pencil lead.      

290
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,893
in a top-secret process,    

291
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,763
the next machine chops this long lead      

292
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,632
into pencil-length leads.   

293
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,504
but the leads can't write just yet.           

294
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,373
they're bathed in a vat    

295
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,443
filled with a mixture of chemical waxes.       

296
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:34,845
these waxes coat and impregnate the leads --  

297
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,648
in this case, red ones.    

298
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,852
wax is a color-delivery vehicle.

299
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,789
as you write, it rubs off and adheres to the paper,   

300
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,524
taking pigment with it.    

301
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,263
with the leads now finished,  

302
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,532
the factory subjects random samples         

303
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,467
to quality control testing,  

304
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,738
including a break test and a durability test      

305
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,072
in which each lead       

306
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,541
must yield 100 yards of writing.

307
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,947
this company makes its pencil bodies    

308
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,150
from cedar wood.        

309
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,020
this machine carves grooves for the leads,         

310
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,956
then coats the surface with a thin layer of glue.   

311
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,596
the planks pass under a wheel that places the leads...    

312
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,700
...then through another machine

313
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,169
that slips a second grooved plank on top.     

314
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,241
the next machine carves the hexagonal shape,  

315
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,878
then slices the pencils apart. 

316
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,986
one at a time,         

317
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,522
the pencils shoot through a vat
of colored varnish.      

318
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:54,926
their exterior is now the same color as the lead inside.   

319
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,665
once the varnish dries,    

320
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,334
a heat stamp burns the company name     

321
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,869
and color number into the wood,

322
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,405
filling the lettering with colored film.       

323
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,409
then the pencils roll across an abrasive wheel,       

324
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,212
sharpening as they go.     

325
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,218
the unsharpened end gets a cap of varnish,     

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,352
either in white        

327
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,055
or the same shade as the pencil lead.      

328
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:30,695
the factory's equipment feeds the appropriate colors  

329
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,497
to the packaging area.     

330
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,366
as the pencils slide into their grooved tray, 

331
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,303
workers visually inspect each and every one.      

332
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,776
from pigments and planks to an artistic medium,     

333
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,979
the story behind the making of colored pencils       

334
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,581
is hardly black and white.   

335
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,518
