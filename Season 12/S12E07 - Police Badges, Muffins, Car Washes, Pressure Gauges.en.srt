2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:07,640
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,320
  narrator: ever since the days 
   of the american wild west,   

4
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:57,657
 badges have been a way to tell 
   the good guys from the bad.  

5
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,560
 sheriffs don't raise posses to 
 maintain law and order anymore,

6
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,730
   but a badge continues to be  
       a powerful symbol,       

7
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,768
     and simply flashing one    
 can still stop a suspect cold. 

8
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,276
            the badge           
     comes with the uniform.    

9
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:20,279
          it identifies         
  the officer's rank and unit.  

10
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,815
      so it's an accessory      
     that makes a statement.    

11
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,819
    each one is custom-made.    

12
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:31,557
    the client spells out the   
specifications on an order form,

13
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,695
 right down to the metal finish 
 and the color of the lettering.

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,770
      this machine delivers     
        a powerful punch        

15
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,008
   to cut sheriff star shapes   
  from a coiled sheet of brass. 

16
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:57,249
     they place a star shape    
  in the steel mold of a press. 

17
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,586
 it applies about 170,000 pounds
      per square centimeter     

18
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,689
      to make an impression     
          on the badge.         

19
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:13,499
 a punch press trims the ragged 
 edges to make it look neater.  

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,074
      a mechanical stamper      
 then inscribes the company name

21
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,442
    on the back of the badge.   

22
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,213
   this computerized engraver   

23
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,384
  then marks the rank and other 
    information on the front.   

24
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,956
   they apply a couple of dabs  
        of silver solder        

25
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,559
    to the back of the badge.   

26
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,160
       it's the substance       

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,097
    that will hold the catch    
    and pin joint in place.     

28
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,168
they blast the back of the badge
          with a torch,         

29
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,571
 and it reaches a temperature of
 over 1,400 degrees fahrenheit. 

30
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:56,876
 this causes the solder to melt,
 fusing the parts to the badge. 

31
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,385
  they then position the badge  
    under a hydraulic press.    

32
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,654
       like a steel fist,       

33
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:12,458
 it punches the badge to give it
     the correct curvature.     

34
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,667
 here they spray a mix of water 
      and tiny glass beads      

35
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,469
         onto the back.         

36
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,204
  this is called wet blasting,  

37
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,474
 and it makes the finish cleaner
       and more textured.       

38
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,949
 a technician now hooks the pin 
          in the joint          

39
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,751
        that was soldered       
         onto the badge.        

40
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:41,187
     he slides the assembly     
          onto a rivet          

41
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,023
     automatically served up    
        by this machine.        

42
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,691
  the machine applies pressure  

43
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:50,362
       to expand the rivet      
  and lock everything in place. 

44
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,564
 the pin now fits in the catch, 

45
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,633
   which will enable the badge  

46
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,436
       to be fastened onto      
  the police officer's uniform. 

47
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,842
     next, they brush enamel    
  into the engraved lettering.  

48
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,443
       the enamel is a mix      
       of glass and water,      

49
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,046
   which comes from an ancient  
     metalworking technique     

50
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,415
        called cloisonné.       

51
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,323
 they fire the badge in a kiln, 

52
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,226
      and the glass enamel      
    melts into the lettering.   

53
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,594
        after it hardens,       

54
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,531
they grind the enameled sections
         against a stone        

55
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,666
   to expose the inscriptions.  

56
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,207
   they then polish the badge   
       to a mirror finish.      

57
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,280
       this automated rack      

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,684
       immerses the badges      
  in a electroplating solution  

59
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,954
        to give the brass       
  a protective layer of nickel. 

60
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,024
     they plate some badges     
       with 24-karat gold.      

61
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:00,499
now they apply a strong adhesive
  to the back of a medallion... 

62
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,567
  then attach it to the center  
          of the badge.         

63
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,369
          the medallion         
     has an official emblem.    

64
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:08,073
        it's specific to        
the police force's jurisdiction.

65
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,179
      they adjust the catch     
        and its hardware        

66
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,850
    to ensure it moves freely   
  and is in good working order. 

67
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:22,555
      after all, no officer     
 wants to lose his or her badge.

68
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,329
 they give it a shine and check 
   for surface imperfections.   

69
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,666
       and now it's ready       
       to report for duty.      

70
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:37,802
  it takes three weeks to make  
  one of these police badges,   

71
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,906
     and they should be good    
   for a lifetime of service.   

72
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,289
            narrator:           
        the word "muffin"       

73
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,757
       appeared in britain      
    around the 11th century.    

74
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,225
       in victorian times,      

75
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,161
     muffins were bought in     
 the street from the muffin man,

76
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,031
   made famous in the popular   
   children's nursery rhyme.    

77
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,834
           in america,          
    cooks began to experiment   

78
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:13,105
  with english muffin recipes,  
 and the modern muffin was born.

79
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,712
          these muffins         
    are a lot like homemade,    

80
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,314
    except to make this many,   

81
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,650
            you need            
    some pretty big equipment   

82
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,352
   and a heap of ingredients.   

83
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,992
   at this commercial bakery,   

84
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:35,594
   they make them with flour,   

85
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,530
  then add salt, baking powder, 

86
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,834
     and a prepared mixture     
       of dry ingredients.      

87
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:47,806
finally, they add vanilla flavor
 and start up the barrel mixer. 

88
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,208
        it's a big one --       

89
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,544
      large enough to hold      
    a ton of batter at least.   

90
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,882
  next, they add oil and water, 
   then vegetable shortening.   

91
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,759
 now here come the blueberries. 

92
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,761
      they go into the mix      
      once they're thawed.      

93
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,230
      berries are delicate,     

94
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:14,300
      so workers take care      
    to pour them out slowly,    

95
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:17,303
      weighing each bucket      
  to add just the right amount. 

96
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,310
  down below, workers pour out  
    close to a ton of batter    

97
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,178
         from the mixer.        

98
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,713
  that's a whole lot of batter. 

99
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:31,450
         just one batch         
   makes about 7,000 muffins.   

100
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,721
      they cover the trough     
      to protect the batter     

101
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:40,192
        until it goes on        
 to fill baking pans like these 

102
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:44,329
    that can hold 54 muffins,   
 each with its own paper liner. 

103
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,131
  a conveyor advances the pans  

104
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,034
        towards a machine       
   called a batter depositor.   

105
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,604
         prepared batter        
    pumps in from the trough    

106
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,240
        and into the pans       
     as they pass below it.     

107
00:07:56,477 --> 00:08:00,012
  the depositor fills the pans  
       one row at a time,       

108
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,182
    measuring out the batter    
           by weight.           

109
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,956
      at the next station,      

110
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,757
           blueberries          
      pass through a funnel     

111
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,225
  equipped with a turning gear  

112
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,363
            and drop            
   right onto the muffin tops.  

113
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:28,707
a bar placed across the conveyor
       blows filtered air       

114
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,543
   to remove any stray berries  
          from the pans         

115
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,879
as they advance to the gas oven.

116
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,923
a metal arm pushes them right in
  to bake for about 30 minutes. 

117
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:49,428
  the oven, open on both sides, 
has dampers to keep in the heat.

118
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,002
the muffins come out of the oven
      baked a golden brown.     

119
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,473
 the pans cool for a few minutes
      and then continue on      

120
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,210
  to a custom-designed machine  
      that's pretty handy.      

121
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,346
     it removes the muffins     
          from the pan          

122
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,614
       and packages them        
       all automatically.       

123
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:14,153
       suction cups seize       
  cardboard flats two at a time 

124
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,789
          and push them         
       onto a tray former.      

125
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:21,160
  the forming head pushes down  
    on the preglued cardboard   

126
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:24,363
          and voilà --          
out comes a perfectly square box

127
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,565
           that falls           
  right onto the conveyor belt. 

128
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,500
   pans full of baked muffins   

129
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,370
        follow alongside        
      on another conveyor.      

130
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,440
        at the next stop,       

131
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,976
  suction cups lift the muffins 
       out of their pans.       

132
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,644
    with military precision,    

133
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,980
       they set them down       
         into neat rows         

134
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:45,517
     in the cardboard boxes     
 that wait on the back conveyor.

135
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,252
          the conveyor          
    carries the filled boxes    

136
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,987
          to a station          
     where they're covered,     

137
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,524
         top and bottom,        
 with a sheet of clear plastic. 

138
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,929
   heated blades cut and seal   
   the plastic at both ends.    

139
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,466
         then the boxes         
   pass through a heat tunnel   

140
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,068
    that shrinks the plastic    
     snugly over the trays.     

141
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,937
 they're now ready for shipping 

142
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,674
          to customers          
  in the food-service industry. 

143
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,543
        on another line,        
     preprinted plastic film    

144
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:15,781
  wraps the individual muffins  
as they flow along the conveyor.

145
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,552
        rotating brushes        
    keep them moving forward    

146
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:24,156
     while blades come down     
 to separate the continuous roll

147
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:27,359
    into individually wrapped   
 muffins ready for retail sale. 

148
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,034
        blueberry, bran,        
   pecan strudel, lemon poppy.  

149
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:41,206
 with so many flavors to choose 
 from, why not try some of each?

150
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,461
  narrator: the best car washes 
        tackle everything       

151
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:05,264
  from road grime and dead bugs 
        to bird droppings       

152
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,265
   that eat away at the paint   
   and metal of your vehicle.   

153
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,668
       car washes help you      
    preserve your investment    

154
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,003
 and increase its resale value. 

155
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,405
       they save you time       

156
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,942
  and help you feel proud about 
   the vehicle you're driving.  

157
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,117
 a state-of-the-art car wash can
  be an eye-opening experience. 

158
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,621
    assorted soaps and waxes    
        clean and pamper        

159
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:32,691
    every part of the vehicle   
       like never before.       

160
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,095
   this effective, yet gentle,  
         cleaning power         

161
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,599
   is made possible using the   
 latest car-cleaning technology.

162
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,707
 it starts with welding together
         the steel frame        

163
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,710
   that travels inside the bay  
        of the car wash,        

164
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,813
      then adding the steel     
      and fiberglass walls.     

165
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,853
    using a milling machine,    

166
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,190
the worker then makes the wheels
   on which the frame travels.  

167
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,726
 the machine first prepares the 
center hole where the axle goes,

168
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,630
then makes a groove in the wheel
   so it can ride on a track.   

169
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,071
   before long, a steel blank   
 becomes a finished drive wheel.

170
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,344
     he then welds the wheel    
       onto a drive shaft.      

171
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,819
  he places the wheel assembly  
in the bottom of the steel frame

172
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,955
     and bolts it in place.     

173
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,098
        he then connects        
        a hydraulic motor       

174
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,166
to the end of the wheel assembly

175
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,936
         and makes sure         
 it couples together perfectly. 

176
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,709
   here a worker puts together  
       the brush assembly       

177
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,178
      that cleans the sides     
         of the vehicle.        

178
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:05,183
the brushes are made of material
        called poly-flex.       

179
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,786
 it comes cut to various lengths

180
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,789
         so that it gets        
into those hard-to-clean places.

181
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,796
     poly-flex won't trap in    
         dirt particles.        

182
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,699
   it's smooth and very gentle  
         on the vehicle.        

183
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,270
the finished side-brush assembly

184
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,675
  consists of seven alternating 
      columns of poly-flex.     

185
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,879
   a worker puts together the   
 pneumatic regulators and gauges

186
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,549
    that control many aspects   
        of the car wash,        

187
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:39,150
 including the brush assemblies 

188
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,354
      and the distribution      
      of soaps and waxes.       

189
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,660
he then bolts the hydraulic pump
          to the frame.         

190
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,436
    he screws on the system's   
       hydraulic filter...      

191
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,238
          then connects         
   the hydraulic pressure line  

192
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,107
 and makes certain it's secure. 

193
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,378
   the hydraulic power system   

194
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,182
    moves the car-wash frame    
    and rotates the brushes,    

195
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,151
         but a computer         
      controls everything.      

196
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,456
  he hooks up the system wires  
  that connect to the computer. 

197
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,258
 the computer makes it possible 

198
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,861
     for the car wash to run    
      without an operator.      

199
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,602
  workers then install the rack 

200
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,938
          that supports         
      an overhead curtain.      

201
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,609
    a worker attaches a shaft   
         to the rack...         

202
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,212
   then a heavy-duty bearing.   

203
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,083
    when the bearing assembly   
          is in place,          

204
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,586
       he secures the rack      
          to the frame.         

205
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,823
        he tests the rack       
          to make sure          

206
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,025
     its computer-controlled    
       pneumatic cylinders      

207
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,695
 manipulate the overhead curtain
           correctly.           

208
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,669
    he tests the oscillating    
     high-pressure nozzles.     

209
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,510
  then he makes sure the wheels 
    move the frame properly.    

210
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,647
           he turns on          
    all the brush assemblies    

211
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,115
  that clean and polish the car 

212
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,085
  and makes sure they spin and  
  oscillate in perfect harmony. 

213
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,392
 the definitive test, of course,
      is an actual car wash     

214
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,995
     that proves the system     
        works flawlessly        

215
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,730
       and that every part      
         of the vehicle         

216
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:35,367
      gets the best washing     
      and waxing possible.      

217
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,141
      after a quick drying,     

218
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,545
     this vehicle drives out    
of the car wash sparkling clean.

219
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,897
 narrator: life without pressure
  gauges would be pretty rough. 

220
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,098
  figuring out everyday things  

221
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,967
like oil pressure, air pressure,
       and blood pressure       

222
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,102
   would be almost impossible.  

223
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,704
    without pressure gauges,    

224
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,173
     we'd even have trouble     
     taking a proper shower     

225
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,043
   because getting the correct  
   water pressure in our homes  

226
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,545
 would be a hit-and-miss affair.

227
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,384
      for a pressure gauge      
       to be trustworthy,       

228
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:29,054
  whether it's measuring gases  
           or liquids,          

229
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:32,723
    it must be exceptionally    
    well-made and accurate.     

230
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,794
    to start, a worker loads    
      an aluminum faceplate     

231
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,329
     into a printing press.     

232
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,597
   it applies a colored scale   

233
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:42,367
   used for measuring pressure  
   in pounds per square inch.   

234
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,870
   the type of scale it prints  

235
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,006
  depends on the measuring unit 
           being used.          

236
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,012
then a worker puts a copper tube

237
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,681
     into a bending machine     

238
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,352
 that bends, cuts, and flattens 
      sections of the tube.     

239
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,358
    the amount of flattening    
           and bending          

240
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,628
  determines the pressure range 
     the gauge can measure.     

241
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,030
       each piece becomes       
     a pressure-sensing tube    

242
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,966
    known as a bourdon tube.    

243
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:20,038
          then a worker         
      cuts lengths of brass     

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
        that he machines        
        into connectors.        

245
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,210
 they will link the bourdon tube
        to an inlet pipe.       

246
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,586
      he melts zinc solder      
 in the connector's receptacle, 

247
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,757
 and he mounts the bourdon tube 
    in the correct position.    

248
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,394
        he fills the gap        
      between the connector     

249
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,729
      and the bourdon tube      
          with solder.          

250
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,600
then he flushes the heated piece
   with water to cool it down,  

251
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,269
   sealing the tube in place.   

252
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,076
    he puts the cooled piece    
      on a mounting fixture     

253
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,544
    and solders the other end   
       of the bourdon tube      

254
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,714
         to the gauge's         
       internal mechanism.      

255
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,486
        he seals the gap        
       and cools it down.       

256
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,291
          then he puts          
      the finished pieces,      

257
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,094
 or pressure-system assemblies, 
     as they're now called,     

258
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,229
    into a cleaning machine.    

259
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,565
      its hot, soapy water      
      washes away any dirt      

260
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,001
   and loose solder particles.  

261
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,772
 the pressure-system assemblies 

262
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,774
           then go on           
    to a leak-testing machine   

263
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,010
 that pushes air into the tubes.

264
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:40,118
    a stable pressure reading   
 indicates there is no leakage. 

265
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,592
         another worker         
     takes a gear mechanism,    

266
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,796
  which controls the mechanical 
   movement inside the gauge,   

267
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,865
 and places it on the connector.

268
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,268
        a machine screws        
  the gear mechanism in place.  

269
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,474
          he then takes         
   the gear's connecting link   

270
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,910
          and rivets it         
to the pressure-system assembly.

271
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:14,686
             he fits            
  the pressure-system assembly  

272
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,622
       inside a protective      
    stainless-steel housing.    

273
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,791
            a machine           
     screws it all together.    

274
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,700
         next, a worker         
    calibrates the assembly.    

275
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,837
         she loosens up         
  the connecting link slightly  

276
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,439
      to prevent friction,      

277
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,642
  puts on the indicator needle, 
        and runs a test.        

278
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,112
   after a bit more adjusting,  

279
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:44,416
   she puts the faceplate and   
  the indicator needle back on. 

280
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,252
      she ensures the gauge     
        reads accurately        

281
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,788
     at three key positions     

282
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,091
  and then screws the faceplate 
         onto the gauge.        

283
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:59,564
      a final test confirms     
   it is calibrated properly.   

284
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,335
   then she puts a glass cover  
       over the faceplate       

285
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,271
      and adds a steel ring     
      to hold it in place.      

286
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,475
       a crimping machine       
  evenly folds the ring's edge  

287
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,812
 until it makes a perfect seal. 

288
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,151
     now she fills the gauge    
         with glycerin.         

289
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:24,155
       glycerin lubricates      
  the internal mechanical parts 

290
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,891
   and increases the lifetime   
          of the gauge.         

291
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,094
      glycerin also absorbs     
         vibration well,        

292
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:34,466
which helps the indicator needle
remain stable during operation. 

293
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,036
       a worker completes       
       the pressure gauge       

294
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,872
  by sealing off the fill hole  
       with a rubber plug.      

295
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,579
 but, of course, not all gauges 
     are built the same way.    

296
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,849
   as accurate and dependable   
        as a swiss watch,       

297
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:55,320
  a trustworthy pressure gauge  
     also has a pretty face.    

298
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,263
