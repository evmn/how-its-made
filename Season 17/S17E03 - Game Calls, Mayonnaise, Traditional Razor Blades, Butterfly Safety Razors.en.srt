      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,388
    narrator: the invention     
    of mechanized game calls    

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,457
          in the middle         
       of the 19th century      

5
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,394
    allowed hunters to mimic    
    the sounds of their prey.   

6
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,329
before these devices came along,

7
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,132
hunters whistled and made noises
        with their hands        

8
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,668
    to lure birds or animals    
      into shooting range,      

9
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,371
        and their efforts       
   weren't always on the mark.  

10
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,541
           [ calling ]          

11
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:19,144
   whether it's a mating call   
or just a sociable "hey, there,"

12
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,881
      a game call is about      
     speaking the language.     

13
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,350
  of course, it all translates  
        into big trouble        

14
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:27,686
      for birds and animals     
          who respond.          

15
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,357
        there are dozens        
    of different game calls,    

16
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,692
   from duck to goose to elk.   

17
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,230
        each game call is       
 a precisely crafted instrument.

18
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:42,234
 to make one, they don't have to
   look far for raw material.   

19
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,036
    a bamboo crop flourishes    

20
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,840
         in the backyard        
    of the louisiana factory.   

21
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:51,243
        bamboo is one of        
   the fastest-growing plants   

22
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:56,248
on the planet, so there's always
         a ready supply.        

23
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,783
       the stem is hollow,      

24
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,586
    which makes it ideal for    
 the game call's larger barrel. 

25
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,391
 after the bamboo cane has been 
 dried for six to eight weeks,  

26
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:08,194
    they cut it to length --    
         about 3 inches.        

27
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,196
 but bamboo isn't the only wood 

28
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,598
            they use            
    for making call barrels.    

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,869
   others are constructed from  
walnut, cherry, or exotic woods.

30
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,138
         they're harder         
     and a bit more rugged,     

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,407
         but, of course,        
       they're also solid.      

32
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:25,277
  a boring machine hollows out  
   these solid walnut blanks.   

33
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,081
  they load them six at a time  
    into the machine's slots,   

34
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,952
  and then lower a holding bar  
  to secure them for drilling.  

35
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:36,422
        a carriage moves        
     the drill bits forward,    

36
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:40,092
 and they hit the walnut blanks 
          dead center.          

37
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,162
 a worker locks a hollow barrel 
           in a lathe.          

38
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,831
          as it spins,          
     he manipulates a blade     

39
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,433
            to carve            
   a slightly concave profile.  

40
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,702
        this will make it       
         easier to grip.        

41
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,038
      he also cuts designs      
         into the wood,         

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,176
 which identify this instrument 
     as a certain duck call.    

43
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,579
     each call has its own      
     distinguishing design.     

44
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,648
     as the duck-call barrel    
       continues to spin,       

45
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,318
          he sands away         
     any burrs or splinters.    

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,487
 what was a simple, wooden tube 

47
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,190
     now has flowing lines      
     and a defining design.     

48
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,594
     next, they spin a stone    
   on each end of the barrel,   

49
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:19,131
  creating a burn that blackens 
     and smoothes the rims.     

50
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,666
      the game-call barrels     
           then funnel          

51
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:26,271
    into the clutch of prongs   
      on a revolving wheel.     

52
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,273
       as the wheel turns,      

53
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,610
   the barrels brush against    
   a series of sanding belts,   

54
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,346
   each one with a finer grit   
         than the last.         

55
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,549
       this final sanding       
 makes the barrels super smooth.

56
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,220
 with a set of pincers, he dips 
    the barrels in a solution   

57
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,923
to seal the wood inside and out.

58
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,692
    the sealant will protect    
        the wooden barrel       

59
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,296
      from rain, humidity,      
     and the user's saliva.     

60
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,832
         after dipping,         

61
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,569
 he leaves the parts in the sun 
        for several hours       

62
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,036
     to bake on the sealant.    

63
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,772
     meanwhile, they machine    
        a smaller barrel        

64
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,441
         which will hold        
     the noise-making parts.    

65
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,844
      using a reaming tool,     

66
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:07,847
  the worker tapers the opening 
      of the larger barrel,     

67
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,782
       and the two barrels      
    now fit snugly together.    

68
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,452
    a worker buffs the barrel   
         with steel wool        

69
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,187
    as it spins on a mandrel.   

70
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,324
   the buffing gives the wood   
        a silky texture,        

71
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:22,995
         and prepares it        
      for a final sealant.      

72
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,532
      production now turns      
   to the noise-making insert.  

73
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:29,802
      a worker pounds a die     
  into a strip of rigid plastic 

74
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,403
     to punch out the reeds.    

75
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,806
  it's this part that vibrates  
     against the tone board     

76
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,208
        to produce sound.       

77
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,010
     the reed's shape varies    

78
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,479
  depending on the kind of call 
           being made.          

79
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,215
       he aligns the reed       
   with the wooden tone board,  

80
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,550
      and then inserts them     

81
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,152
 part of the way into the barrel
        of the game call.       

82
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,421
 he sands a little, wooden wedge

83
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,091
    that will hold everything   
            in place.           

84
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,826
   he pushes it into the space  

85
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:57,029
 between the barrel and the reed
         and tone board.        

86
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,497
    then, using a metal file,   

87
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,433
       he forces the wedge      
  even further into the opening 

88
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,635
to ensure the parts won't budge.

89
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,437
   he slides the larger barrel  

90
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,240
    over the protruding reed    
         and tone board.        

91
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:15,581
       after some tuning,       
     the game call is ready.    

92
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,119
     in a way, hunting calls    
 are like musical instruments --

93
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,957
 it takes practice and know-how 
    to use one successfully.    

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,330
       but once mastered,       

95
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:35,734
  this instrument could attract 
       flocks of admirers.      

96
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,002
           [ calling ]          

97
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,539
   after all, every game call   
     has a target audience.     

98
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,875
           [ calling ]          

99
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,231
            narrator:           
    according to one theory,    

100
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,434
      mayonnaise originated     
 in the town of mahón in spain, 

101
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:12,103
       where it was known       
      as "salsa mahonesa."      

102
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,506
           mayonnaise           
    makes sandwiches zestier,   

103
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,908
        turns canned tuna       
        into tuna salad,        

104
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,844
hard-boiled eggs into egg salad,

105
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,114
     and is a creamy dip for    
  french fries, belgian-style.  

106
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,721
    mayonnaise recipes vary,    

107
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,790
    but all have eggs and oil   
    as the main ingredients.    

108
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,127
   the eggs can be all yolks,   

109
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,730
           all whites,          
    or a combination of both.   

110
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,133
   at this mayonnaise factory,  

111
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,671
       the raw eggs arrive      
 in liquid form by tanker trunk.

112
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,006
    they've been pasteurized    

113
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:50,408
     to kill off salmonella     
   and other common bacteria.   

114
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,477
        the egg supplier        

115
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,346
        has also cleaned        
   and sealed the tank valve,   

116
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,748
          an additional         
     food-safety precaution.    

117
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,819
   a worker clamps a sanitary   
  evacuation hose to the tank.  

118
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:05,557
     then, with a few blows     
of a mallet, releases the valve.

119
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:08,227
      a pump draws the eggs     
        through the hose        

120
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:10,629
       into a refrigerated      
         receiving tank.        

121
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,365
   the second main ingredient,  
          soy bean oil,         

122
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,367
 arrives by railway tanker car. 

123
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,970
    like all bulk-ingredient    
           deliveries,          

124
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:21,773
    for food safety, the tank   
    is sealed at the supplier   

125
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,444
    to ensure it isn't opened   
     prior to arrival here.     

126
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:30,582
   a pumping system transfers   
the oil to a large holding tank.

127
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:34,452
   meanwhile, factory workers   
   weigh out the ingredients    

128
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,390
   that make up this company's  
     secret blend of spices.    

129
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,726
 next, they mix this spice blend

130
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:44,229
       with white vinegar,      
    cider vinegar, and salt.    

131
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,202
          then they add         
     liquid natural flavors.    

132
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,474
     they pour this mixture     

133
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,410
        into a large tank       
   of room-temperature water,   

134
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,946
    producing what they call    
           a "slurry."          

135
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,086
    the raw eggs, meanwhile,    
      have been transferred     

136
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:11,023
          into a large,         
   refrigerated holding tank.   

137
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,560
     so now there are three     
  holding tanks at the ready -- 

138
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:18,296
   a slurry tank, an egg tank,  
        and an oil tank.        

139
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,032
         a computerized         
      proportioning system      

140
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,168
  extracts the required amount  
         from each tank         

141
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,337
and sends it to a mixing vessel.

142
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,643
  a couple of minutes of mixing 
        at high agitation       

143
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:36,081
merges the eggs, oil, and slurry
 into tangy, creamy mayonnaise. 

144
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,857
           the factory          
   draws samples periodically   

145
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:47,326
        and sends them to       
 its quality-control department 

146
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,528
          for analysis.         

147
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,599
   the lab technicians there    
   evaluate several criteria,   

148
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:58,070
   such as color, consistency,  
     and, of course, flavor.    

149
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,671
   in this test, for example,   

150
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,141
        they mix the mayo       
      with phenolphthalein,     

151
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,876
      a ph-level indicator,     

152
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:08,347
      and de-ionized water      
   to check the acidity level.  

153
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:12,084
   once the mayonnaise passes   
   quality-control inspection,  

154
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,219
 this rotary filler dispenses it

155
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:19,757
         into recyclable        
       polyethylene jars.       

156
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,761
        it fills each jar       
    in just a quarter second.   

157
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,603
        the next machine        
    twists on a plastic cap.    

158
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,246
 inside the cap is a foil seal. 

159
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,249
          this machine          
  uses targeted induction heat  

160
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,918
        to fuse the seal        
      to the rim of the jar     

161
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,987
 without heating the mayonnaise 
         in the process.        

162
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,924
  the seal preserves freshness  

163
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,859
      and indicates the jar     
      wasn't tampered with      

164
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,195
   after leaving the factory.   

165
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:59,531
      the labeling machine      
 glues on one end of the label, 

166
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,200
          spins the jar         
    to wrap the label around,   

167
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,436
 then glues down the other end. 

168
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,408
     the quality-control lab    

169
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,745
       also performs some       
  post-production spot-checks.  

170
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,682
  in this test, technicians use 
  a machine called a viscometer 

171
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,386
           to measure           
   the product's consistency.   

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,693
           the factory          
     also packages its mayo     

173
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,695
  into single-serving pouches.  

174
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,632
  they're made of polyethylene  
        film on one side,       

175
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:38,303
      foil printed with the     
   product label on the other.  

176
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,773
   this multi-tasking machine   
     forms rows of pouches,     

177
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,710
    inserts about four ounces   
    of mayonnaise per pouch,    

178
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:47,646
    then seals and separates    
          the pouches.          

179
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,584
    these pouches are shipped   
 to ready-made sandwich vendors 

180
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:57,890
 and fast-food restaurants whose
 customers need mayo on the go. 

181
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,075
        narrator: cavemen       
    sharpened pieces of flint   

182
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,478
          and used them         
   to shave their facial hair.  

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,148
    modern man can simply go    
 purchase a pack of razor blades

184
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,415
         for his shaver.        

185
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,619
 while several styles of shavers
        and blades exist,       

186
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,356
many men believe the traditional
       type of razor blade      

187
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,193
     gives the closest shave    
          of them all.          

188
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,465
  they're paper-thin, yet sharp 
    enough and strong enough    

189
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:44,836
         to cut through         
       the coarsest beard.      

190
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,040
      razor blades are made     
  from a stainless-steel strip  

191
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,243
          that's a mere         
     .004 of an inch thick.     

192
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,246
     the strip first enters     
       a punching machine       

193
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,815
         that stamps out        
    the overall blade shape.    

194
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,428
  these dull-edged blades-to-be 
       are called blanks.       

195
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,067
  at this stage of the process, 

196
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,205
   the stainless steel is very  
 soft -- as pliable as paper -- 

197
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,874
       so they now harden       
         and strength it        

198
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,943
       through a four-step      
     heat-treatment process.    

199
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,879
step one -- they heat the blanks
          in a furnace          

200
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:32,183
   to just over 2,000 degrees   
fahrenheit for about 30 seconds.

201
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,754
    step two -- they briefly    
  submerge them in cold water.  

202
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,422
    this is called quenching.   

203
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,025
  step three -- they chill them 
      for about 20 seconds      

204
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:45,230
  in a deep-cooling chamber at  
a temperature of -58 fahrenheit.

205
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,433
     all this progressively     
  re-structures the molecules,  

206
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,768
      hardening the metal.      

207
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,371
            however,            
   the metal becomes brittle,   

208
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:56,008
    necessitating re-heating    
   the blanks for 20 seconds.   

209
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,979
       the now-hard blanks      
  then move through a printer,  

210
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:05,517
          which applies         
   the razor-blade brand name.  

211
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,387
           gas flames           
   instantly dry the wet ink.   

212
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,258
  now it's time for the blanks  
        to become blades.       

213
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,861
     they enter a grinding      
     and polishing machine.     

214
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,731
            within it           
   are three grinding stations  

215
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,933
which first sharpen the contour,

216
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,003
          then produce          
 two super-sharp cutting edges. 

217
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,272
  the blades then pass through  
       a polishing station      

218
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,075
       that removes burrs       
      left by the grinding.     

219
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,612
 until now, the blades have been
    connected to each other.    

220
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,949
   as they exit this machine,   
     a knife separates them.    

221
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,690
          the factory's         
       quality-control lab      

222
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,026
          pulls samples         
    from the production line    

223
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,294
           and checks,          
      among other criteria,     

224
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,899
the quality of the grinding and 
geometrics of the cutting edges.

225
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,567
    then, every single blade    
      the factory produces      

226
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,370
           is examined          
    for cutting-edge defects.   

227
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,907
   technicians assemble blades  
     in packs of up to 800,     

228
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:06,978
  then shine fluorescent light  
 on the two cutting-edge sides. 

229
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,047
   this makes defects visible.  

230
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,183
blades that pass this inspection

231
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,320
     are washed with solvent    
    to remove contaminants...   

232
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:20,992
         ...then dried.         

233
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,796
  the now-pristine razor blades 
    go into a vacuum chamber.   

234
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,866
    it draws a chromium-based   
    coating onto the surface,   

235
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:33,671
   rendering the cutting edges  
 harder and more wear-resistant.

236
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,008
       next, spray nozzles      
   apply a non-stick coating,   

237
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,878
   which will help the blades   
  glide smoothly over the skin. 

238
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,481
      to adhere the coating     
           permanently          

239
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,083
      to the blade surface,     

240
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,788
 they bake it on for 20 minutes 
at about 660 degrees fahrenheit.

241
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:55,293
   quality-control technicians  
       test samples again,      

242
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:59,764
 this time to ensure the blades 
 meet strength specifications.  

243
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,967
        this test machine       
   measures the force required  

244
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:07,439
for the blade to cut a thick wad
of wet paper to a certain depth.

245
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,115
       back in production,      

246
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,252
   workers submerge the razor   
      blades in organic oil     

247
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,853
     for about half an hour.    

248
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,058
    this provides additional    
  protection against corrosion. 

249
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,727
     on the packaging line,     

250
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:32,531
 the equipment wraps each blade 
   individually in wax paper.   

251
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,671
  the wax coating on the paper  

252
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,340
  helps protect the razor blade 
        against corrosion       

253
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,675
         during storage.        

254
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:47,278
   wax paper is also stronger   
       than regular paper,      

255
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,416
so the blade's razor-sharp edges
      don't cut through it.     

256
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,820
 the edge of these razor blades 

257
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:58,689
   are about 10 times thinner   
       than a human hair.       

258
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,426
     a blade typically lasts    
        about six shaves,       

259
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,295
so the average male goes through
          quite a few,          

260
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,965
        considering that,       
over the course of his lifetime,

261
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:12,037
   he'll have spent more than   
  3,300 hours shaving his face. 

262
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,719
            narrator:           
in the age of disposable razors,

263
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,522
   the butterfly safety razor   
       still has an edge.       

264
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,056
    this precision metal tool   

265
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,592
     is good for a lifetime     
        of clean shaves.        

266
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,194
   a few twists of the handle,  

267
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,129
   and the butterfly mechanism  
              opens             

268
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,132
        to allow cleaning       
  and replacement of the blade. 

269
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,903
 with it, getting rid of stubble
     is very little trouble.    

270
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,607
  invented in the last century, 

271
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,343
   the butterfly safety razor   

272
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,778
        has done its part       
      to prevent injuries.      

273
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,413
    the blade can be replaced   

274
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,882
    without actually touching   
         the sharp edge.        

275
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,751
       the butterfly doors      
   also close around the blade  

276
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,887
       for a safer shave.       

277
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,225
           also known           
   as the twist-to-open razor,  

278
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,363
       this grooming tool       
     is anything but simple.    

279
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,566
         it's comprised         
       of about 20 parts.       

280
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,703
        production begins       
      with solid zinc bars.     

281
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,273
     they melt down the bars    
       in a big cauldron.       

282
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,378
           the machine          
  then presses the melted zinc  

283
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,779
           into a mold          
      of three razor parts.     

284
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,448
    the zinc instantly cools    

285
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,318
  and solidifies into the shape 
          of the parts.         

286
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,654
         they're linked         
     by more hardened zinc.     

287
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,122
    a worker separates them,    

288
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,791
  revealing a support structure 
         for the blade,         

289
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,859
           a framework          
    for the butterfly flaps,    

290
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:46,331
      and the outer casing      
   for the blade-support part.  

291
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,134
  breaking them free from one   
  another leaves ragged edges,  

292
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,203
 so a worker grinds them smooth.

293
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,809
       but there are still      
         a few blemishes        

294
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,277
     to rub off the surface.    

295
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,279
      the parts toss about      
          in a tumbler          

296
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,615
      filled with abrasive      
       synthetic pellets.       

297
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:09,487
  after about half an hour, the 
surface irregularities are gone.

298
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,356
   next, a computerized drill   

299
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:15,026
   bores into the center of a   
     spinning aluminum dowel    

300
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,162
        as a second tool        
      contours the outside.     

301
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:22,767
 this transforms the dowel into 
 nuts for adjusting the blade.  

302
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,573
 they shape the aluminum handle 
          the same way.         

303
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,243
         now they apply         
  a more durable chrome finish. 

304
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:36,514
      this process involves     
  three electro-plating baths.  

305
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:40,652
  the first one gives the parts 
        a copper coating.       

306
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:44,055
 then it's into the nickel bath.

307
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,592
      in this case, nickel      
 is a go-between kind of finish.

308
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,528
      it will allow chrome      
      to stick to the part.     

309
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,265
   after a chemical treatment   
       for a matte finish,      

310
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,735
      they plunge the parts     
      into the chrome bath.     

311
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,606
     a quick rinse in water     
       reveals the result.      

312
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:05,443
       the parts now have       
a resilient matte-chrome finish.

313
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,484
       once all the parts       
      have been fabricated,     

314
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,221
      it's time to assemble     
      the butterfly razor.      

315
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,556
            a worker            
    drives a threaded insert    

316
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,559
     into the outer casing      
     for the blade support.     

317
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,895
  she installs a similar insert 
      in the adjustment nut     

318
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:29,100
     we saw being fabricated    
            early on.           

319
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:33,037
    these inserts enable her    
to screw the two parts together.

320
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,042
     she sets aside the nut     
   and blade-support assembly.  

321
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:41,045
       she slides a spring      
  onto the razor's center rod.  

322
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:46,917
  this spring pushes up the rod 
  to open the butterfly flaps.  

323
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,453
    she dabs thread-lock glue   

324
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:52,056
   on the threaded section of   
the butterfly-flap support part,

325
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:56,260
    and then screws the part    
   to the razor's center rod.   

326
00:19:56,262 --> 00:20:01,199
next, she installs the butterfly
   flaps on the support part.   

327
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:08,740
   the various sub-assemblies   
   now need to come together.   

328
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,209
         she begins with        
   the blade-support structure  

329
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,276
         and brass stem.        

330
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,946
      she attaches a spring     

331
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:18,116
  and slides the adjustment-nut 
     assembly onto the stem.    

332
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,554
  she inserts a plastic washer  
       into the assembly,       

333
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:27,425
allowing her to screw the handle
    onto the adjustment nut.    

334
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:32,029
   she now pops the center rod  
    with the butterfly doors    

335
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,766
  into the assembled framework  

336
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,569
    and adjusts the assembly.   

337
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,975
she threads a set screw onto the
center rod and into the handle. 

338
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:47,245
 the screw will prevent the user
 from turning the handle too far

339
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:52,183
        and compromising        
    the butterfly mechanism.    

340
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:56,654
 an end cap attached to the base
 holds the center rod in place. 

341
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,924
  finally, she tests the handle 
     and screw-rod mechanism    

342
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,659
 that opens the butterfly flaps 

343
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,262
          and confirms          
 that they're fully functional. 

344
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,198
   it's taken about 20 minutes  

345
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,934
           to produce           
  this butterfly safety razor.  

346
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,937
     with regular cleaning      
     between blade changes,     

347
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,873
 it should last for many years. 

348
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,342
 good thing, because there will 
    always be a growing need    

349
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,012
 for this reusable shaving tool.
