    discovery communications

00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,920
narrator: alligator bags enjoyed
 their first wave of popularity 

4
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,323
 at the end of the 19th century.

5
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,192
     the material was chosen    
      for its exotic look,      

6
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,863
          rich texture,         
high pliability, and durability.

7
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,666
           since then,          
many legendary designer handbags

8
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:09,936
         have been made         
      with alligator skin.      

9
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:13,072
         for some women,        

10
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:16,008
        a handbag is more       
   than a practical accessory.  

11
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,011
         it's also a way        
to express their personal style.

12
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,681
  depending on the bag's size,  
    shape, and desired look,    

13
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,151
    many exotic animal skins    
         can be used --         

14
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:29,822
       alligator, lizard,       
       python, or ostrich.      

15
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:39,966
          this red skin         
   is from the nile alligator.  

16
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,007
the cutter maintains the pattern
     in place with a weight.    

17
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,710
           he cuts out          
      the shape of the bag,     

18
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,979
        leaving a border,       
      called a turning-in,      

19
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,949
     all along the pattern.     

20
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,720
       the skiving machine      

21
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,789
        delicately shaves       
 the back of the alligator skin 

22
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,425
  to make it thin and pliable.  

23
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,465
        a polishing jack        
        creates a sheen.        

24
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:20,873
        a plating machine       
    applies heat and pressure   

25
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,543
        to remove creases       
    and make the skin shiny.    

26
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,746
 now it is placed on a hot plate
        for a few seconds       

27
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,081
        to raise the skin       

28
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,350
    and create what is called   
         french bombay.         

29
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,626
    they brush rubber cement    
    on the back of the skin     

30
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,829
  and apply it to a thin piece  
  of leather called a pliver.   

31
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,100
   this will keep the bombay    
   from flattening over time.   

32
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,706
        then he cuts off        
        the excess skin,        

33
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,710
     creating a turning-in.     

34
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:01,580
    this heavy paper and foam   
 will go inside the bag's cover 

35
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,984
      to give it structure      
      and a cushiony feel.      

36
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,987
           he removes           
  the center part of the paper  

37
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,389
 to help the cover fold easily. 

38
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,795
  he uses a bone folder to fold 
the turning-in over the paper...

39
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:19,598
    then carefully hammers it   
            in place.           

40
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,740
   now he's making the sides,   
         called gussets,        

41
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,542
   and the bottom of the bag.   

42
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,210
     he applies thin muslin     

43
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:36,214
      and rubs it in place      
    under a protective paper.   

44
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,750
      both gussets are sewn     
       to the bag's bottom      

45
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,819
    using a very fine needle.   

46
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:44,423
          the stitches          
must be as discreet as possible.

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,824
    the bag's lining is made    

48
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:50,162
      of soft lamb leather      
        called cabretta.        

49
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,831
          the top half          
   contains a magnetic circle   

50
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,700
 which serves to close the bag. 

51
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,303
      the brand's nameplate     
 is also attached to the lining.

52
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,372
          the nameplate         
       sits inside the bag      

53
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:04,042
   so it will only be visible   
      when the bag is open.     

54
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,443
      the pocketbook maker      

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,882
   delicately glues the lining  
    to the bottom of the bag.   

56
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:12,785
    he folds the leather over   
      with the bone folder      

57
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,453
       and uses the hammer      

58
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,790
      to make the juncture      
      as thin as possible.      

59
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,192
        since the covers        
       are glued in place,      

60
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,127
  there are no stitches visible 

61
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,796
      on the front and back     
           of the bag,          

62
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,766
giving it a more luxurious look.

63
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,471
   now he scratches the border  
      to remove the sheen,      

64
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:36,142
 which will help the glue adhere
         to the leather.        

65
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,483
  he applies the back and front 
 cover to the lining of the bag,

66
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,485
   making sure all the covers   
       line up perfectly.       

67
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,087
   this step is only performed  

68
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,156
         by experienced         
       pocketbook makers,       

69
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,093
        as it is crucial        
  to the final look of the bag. 

70
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,828
   anything less than perfect   

71
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,697
         would look like        
       a cheap imitation.       

72
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,499
      custom-colored paints     
      will fill in any gaps     

73
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,170
     and cover any variation    
         in the leather.        

74
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,844
           they finish          
      by polishing the bag,     

75
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,512
      using a small amount      
         of shoe polish         

76
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,314
      and a buffing cloth.      

77
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,116
they must use very little polish

78
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,786
        to avoid buildup        
  in the grain of the leather.  

79
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,623
        this also removes       
       any dirt or cement.      

80
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,664
   it takes about seven hours   
   to make an alligator bag.    

81
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,066
      all the time, effort,     
          and materials         

82
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,602
       result in a stylish      
        fashion accessory       

83
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:39,738
 that's made to last for years. 

84
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,687
            narrator:           
  lockers are a familiar sight  

85
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,557
    in high-school corridors,   
       gym changing rooms,      

86
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,559
      and many workplaces,      

87
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,761
        and in the world        
     of professional sports,    

88
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,298
    lockers are the backdrop    
 to many a post-game interview. 

89
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,168
   the latest trend is buying   
   lockers for kids' bedrooms   

90
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,238
      as cool and practical     
       storage furniture.       

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,108
         while they vary        
       in size and design,      

92
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,577
           all lockers          
     have ventilation holes.    

93
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:22,581
    these help air circulate,   
      which prevents odors.     

94
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
        lockers are made        
     of a hard type of steel    

95
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,852
   that's just flexible enough  

96
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,256
       for presses to bend      
     to the required shape.     

97
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:34,526
        the steel sheets        
   are 1/10 of an inch thick.   

98
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,794
   workers feed one at a time   

99
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:39,064
     through a cutting tool     
     called a square shear.     

100
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,268
     it slices from one end     
   of the sheet to the other,   

101
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,470
         cutting pieces         
    with the required width.    

102
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,674
      each door piece goes      
   into a 100-ton punch press,  

103
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:52,410
        which stamps out        
     the ventilation holes.     

104
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,081
  the next press punches screw  
and rivet holes around the edges

105
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:01,353
  and a hole for the cup that   
  houses the locker's closure.  

106
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,688
     the first bending press    

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,623
    simultaneously folds over   
    the top and bottom edges,   

108
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,360
        forming flanges.        

109
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:12,064
         this bend sets         
the finished height of the door.

110
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,236
       the next bend sets       
 the finished<i> width</i> of the door.

111
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,905
 the press folds the side edges 
           over twice,          

112
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,675
    forming a box-shaped rim.   

113
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,180
     next, workers position     
   a steel reinforcement panel  

114
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:31,617
     against the hinge side     
          of the door.          

115
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,322
they affix one side of the panel

116
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:42,161
  using a welding machine that  
 fuses 12 spots simultaneously. 

117
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,440
  then they weld the other side 
            manually.           

118
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,948
     now they mount the door    
     in an alignment fixture    

119
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,282
          hinge-side up         

120
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,320
     and clamp a piano hinge    
          to the edge.          

121
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,160
 they fuse the hinge to the door

122
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,064
          by welding it         
 to the top row of screw holes. 

123
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,705
           meanwhile,           
    they bend pieces of steel   

124
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,308
    to form the locker's top,   
    bottom, back, and sides.    

125
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,245
    now they weld those parts   
            together.           

126
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,714
    then they weld the hasp,    

127
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,717
         the steel loop         
through which you hook a padlock

128
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,252
       to lock the locker.      

129
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,855
            the hasp            
  goes on the edge of the body  

130
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:46,925
  and protrudes through a slot  
 in the closure cup in the door.

131
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,561
              next,             
  the locker's interior shelf.  

132
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,599
      they set four rivets      
  onto a positioning fixture -- 

133
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,934
       two in the center,       
       two on the edge --       

134
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,870
 then position the shelf on top,

135
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:01,940
 aligning the shelf's four holes
      with the four rivets.     

136
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,743
   they position a single hook  
      over each edge rivet      

137
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,079
         and weld it on.        

138
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,888
  then they take a double hook  

139
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,691
         and position it        
  over the two center rivets... 

140
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,995
       then weld that on.       

141
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,034
    then they weld the shelf    
      into the locker body.     

142
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,171
     all the parts now head     
 into the factory's paint shop. 

143
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,506
        the powder paint        
     they use for this model    

144
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,975
  contains electrically charged 
       silver particles --      

145
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,643
     a natural disinfectant     

146
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,847
    that kills any bacteria,    
       viruses, and fungi       

147
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,382
    on the locker's surface.    

148
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:46,251
    once coated, the parts go   
  into an oven for a half-hour  

149
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,855
       to bake the paint.       

150
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,524
   then final assembly begins.  

151
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,727
    first, workers mount the    
  closure cup and the door hole 

152
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:59,598
          with a screw          
     and a retaining washer.    

153
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,202
              next,             
   they install magnet catches  

154
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,672
   to hold the door closed...   

155
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,606
  and apply an adhesive sticker 

156
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,245
   indicating this locker has   
 an antimicrobial paint coating.

157
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,885
    then they attach the door   
           to the body          

158
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,887
        by driving rivets       
 through the lower row of holes 

159
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,889
       on the piano hinge.      

160
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,696
         they make sure         
     the door moves smoothly    

161
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,100
    and that the hasp aligns    
    with the slot in the cup.   

162
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,435
    the factory makes lockers   

163
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:39,437
        of various sizes,       
   shapes, and configurations.  

164
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,942
      some models even have     
   built-in combination locks.  

165
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,258
  narrator: since roman times,  
       woodworking planes       

166
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,526
         have been part         
  of the carpenter's tool kit.  

167
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,996
  and despite the invention of  
 power tools for wood surfacing,

168
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:09,134
 many still prefer the hands-on 
 approach of this simple tool.  

169
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,535
       using it is a skill      

170
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,139
 that can take a piece of timber
     from rough to refined.     

171
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,343
     if wood needs shaping,     

172
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,612
       it's time to reach       
      for the bench plane.      

173
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,146
       on the push stroke,      

174
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,549
         it shaves down         
  bumps and high spots on wood  

175
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,286
       to make the surface      
         level and true.        

176
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:30,021
        production begins       
   with bench-plane patterns.   

177
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,756
   they place several in a box  

178
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:36,828
 and pour fine sand, mixed with 
 a bonding chemical, over them. 

179
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,564
      the bonding chemical      
      solidifies the sand.      

180
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:43,635
         they poke holes        
     to vent gases later on.    

181
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,536
 and with the patterns removed, 

182
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,907
   it's clear that the bonding  
 chemical has worked its magic. 

183
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,643
     the patterns have left     
     a definite impression      

184
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,680
      in the hardened sand.     

185
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,182
         they apply glue        
     to one half of the mold    

186
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:03,388
    so it adheres to the half   
   with the impressions in it.  

187
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,325
         they then glue         
    two square-shaped spouts    

188
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:10,662
 around holes in the sand mold. 

189
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,064
       next, they fire up       
       the foundry furnace      

190
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:18,303
          and melt iron         
    into a white-hot liquid.    

191
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,939
   workers then carefully pour  
        the molten metal        

192
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,209
     down the square spouts     
    and into the sand molds.    

193
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,746
 gases are released through the 
holes poked in the sand earlier,

194
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:31,950
   while weights keep the lids  
 from lifting from the pressure.

195
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,754
   after a two-hour cooldown,   

196
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,292
    they break the molds and    
  pick out the cast-iron parts. 

197
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,628
           the planes           
   have a knobby protuberance,  

198
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,029
     formed as metal flowed     
         into the mold.         

199
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,565
      they slice that off.      

200
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,035
   and after strengthening the  
cast iron's physical properties,

201
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,836
            they mill           
  the bottom of the bench plane 

202
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,239
   to make it reasonably flat.  

203
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,710
     they also expose a slit    
     formed during molding.     

204
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,979
  they now lock the bench plane 
           in position          

205
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,914
    to allow the spiked teeth   
       of a cutting wheel       

206
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,317
 to carve into the molded slit. 

207
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,586
  it enlarges the slit to form  
  the mouth of the bench plane, 

208
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,324
    the opening through which   
the plane's blade will protrude.

209
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,130
 some precision work is needed, 

210
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,868
 so a tapered and serrated tool 
  is forced through the mouth.  

211
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,803
 this opens it up a little more 

212
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,605
           to give it           
 the exact dimensions required. 

213
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,609
        coolant now flows       
     to prevent overheating,    

214
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,812
  as a grinding wheel machines  
  the base of each bench plane  

215
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,148
   until it's completely flat.  

216
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,221
      they now try to slip      
     a very thin steel strip    

217
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,224
       between a level bar      
and the base of the bench plane.

218
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,494
        failure confirms        
      it's perfectly flat.      

219
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,364
      next, a cutting tool      
       evens a sloped pad       

220
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,432
      molded onto the front     
       of the bench plane.      

221
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,702
   this pad, called the frog,   
   will hold the sliding wedge  

222
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,038
       that sets the angle      
       of the plane blade.      

223
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,708
           production           
    now focuses on the blade.   

224
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,642
      they heat a steel rod     
          in a furnace          

225
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,579
      until it's white-hot      
         and malleable.         

226
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,848
       they then place it       
    under a mechanized hammer   

227
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,250
which pounds it until it's flat.

228
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,519
  they turn the flattened steel 
            sideways,           

229
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:19,123
    and the pulsating hammer    
       squares the edges.       

230
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,127
        then another tool       
  stamps the company's insignia 

231
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,864
   onto one end of the blade.   

232
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:30,535
     the steel rod has been     
flattened, squared, and stamped.

233
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,937
  it's then cut to the desired  
      shape and dimensions      

234
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,742
            and given           
     a beveled cutting edge.    

235
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:39,344
          the next part         
     is called a lever cap,     

236
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:43,281
and it will be used to clamp the
 blade to the bench-plane frog. 

237
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:47,419
     they sand it smooth to     
 improve its look and function. 

238
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,421
         they then buff         
  each part of the bench plane  

239
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:53,525
      against a cloth wheel     
    to a mirror-like finish.    

240
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,432
          it's now time         
   to fit the bench-plane frog  

241
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:05,170
          into the pad          
   machined especially for it.  

242
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,572
   they secure it with screws.  

243
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,173
       the cutting blade,       

244
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,976
        by now reinforced       
 by a part called the cap iron, 

245
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,912
     fits flush to the frog.    

246
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,982
    they top off the assembly   
        with a lever cap        

247
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,719
    and clamp it all together   
      with a spring system.     

248
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,121
         they fit a knob        
      made of tropical wood     

249
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,558
        on a threaded rod       
on the front of the bench plane.

250
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,396
  the knob and the back handle  
       will allow the user      

251
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,799
 to firmly grip the bench plane 
      and push it forward.      

252
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,937
       and with the blade       
         now protruding         

253
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,805
   from the base on an angle,   

254
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,074
           it's ready           
   to level any piece of wood,  

255
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:46,278
      leaving only shavings     
          in its wake.          

256
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,825
            narrator:           
     a flight data recorder,    

257
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,160
         or a black box,        

258
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,163
      records every detail      
  of an aircraft's operations,  

259
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,765
       from engine speed        
       to cabin pressure.       

260
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,902
         after a crash,         
 investigators extract the data 

261
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,704
  to determine what went wrong. 

262
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,307
           black boxes          
   are actually bright orange   

263
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,510
      so they'll stand out      
       amid the wreckage.       

264
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,579
        these black boxes       
    are the deployable type,    

265
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,049
      meaning they separate     
 from the aircraft upon impact. 

266
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,317
     this makes them easier     

267
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,388
   for search-and-rescue crews  
           to recover.          

268
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,458
     to make the outer shell    
   that houses the components,  

269
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,526
    they use a two-part mold,   

270
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,797
         first waxing it        
  to ease extraction later on.  

271
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,733
       then they brush on       
   an orange-tinted gel coat,   

272
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,735
a liquid that, after four hours,

273
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:47,138
     hardens into a durable,    
       waterproof finish.       

274
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
   over the hardened gel coat,  

275
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,409
        they apply pieces       
      of fiberglass cloth,      

276
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,514
         saturating them        
    with orange-tinted resin.   

277
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,355
   they apply extra pieces in   
 the corners for reinforcement. 

278
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,693
          they continue         
     until they've built up     

279
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,763
   three layers of fiberglass.  

280
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:16,301
the rectangular box on this mold
half-casts a cavity in the shell

281
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,170
         that will house        
  the device's key components.  

282
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,040
   they embed aluminum plates   
      within the fiberglass     

283
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,508
      to reinforce the area     

284
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,445
    where screws will attach    
        the cavity cover.       

285
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,384
        a computer-guided       
         milling machine        

286
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,052
    contours a piece of foam    

287
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,523
  that will fit the empty space 
        inside the shell.       

288
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,926
            this foam           
   absorbs the force of impact  

289
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,462
   so the flight data recorder  
      can survive a crash.      

290
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,465
      they coat one side of     
 the foam core with resin paste,

291
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,001
   then lay it into the mold.   

292
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,870
      they fill voids with      
   a temporary retaining block  

293
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,473
    to prevent the foam core    
     from collapsing inward     

294
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,542
    during the vacuum process   
        that comes next.        

295
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,479
   they wrap the mold in felt   
     to protect the surface,    

296
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,282
    put it in a plastic bag,    
         attach a hose,         

297
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,084
     then start the suction.    

298
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:10,088
   over four hours, the vacuum  
    slowly extracts the air,    

299
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,158
     drawing the fiberglass     
  tightly against the foam core 

300
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,960
without any wrinkles or puckers.

301
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,630
 it takes another four hours for
  the resin to completely cure. 

302
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,299
    then they remove the mold   
      from the vacuum bag,      

303
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,169
     coat the other side of     
 the foam core with resin paste,

304
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,974
 and embed steel reinforcements.

305
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,509
        besides absorbing       
      the force of impact,      

306
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,379
       the foam core makes      
the flight data recorder buoyant

307
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,315
   should the aircraft go down  
       in a body of water.      

308
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,919
           the device           
     contains two antennas,     

309
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,253
 the first of which gets pasted 

310
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,190
     into a designated spot     
        in the foam core.       

311
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:48,126
           one antenna          
  transmits a distress signal,  

312
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,794
    the other a homing signal   

313
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,265
 to help search-and-rescue crews
   locate the downed aircraft.  

314
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,468
          now they mate         
   the two parts of the mold,   

315
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,804
  carefully sliding the antenna 
  that protrudes from one half  

316
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,575
   through and out an opening   
       in the other half.       

317
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,016
    they bolt the mold closed   

318
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,487
       and leave the paste      
     to air-cure overnight.     

319
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,626
    the next day, they unbolt   
 the mold and extract the shell,

320
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,962
     the two halves of which    
         are now bonded         

321
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,164
 with the first antenna inside. 

322
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,968
      now they can install      
      the other components,     

323
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,838
   such as this memory module   
  containing the circuit boards 

324
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,508
   that record the flight data  
       and cockpit audio.       

325
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,443
       all the components,      
     prior to installation,     

326
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:43,515
    undergo extensive testing   
 to ensure they operate properly

327
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,385
   when subjected to vibration  
    and extreme temperatures.   

328
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,988
        the memory module       
   goes into a fireproof box,   

329
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,325
 along with the transmitter that
  sends out the locating signal 

330
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,460
        via the antennas,       

331
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,062
       the second of which      
        they now install        

332
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,532
    into the component cavity   
     at the top of the box.     

333
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,400
  then they install the battery 

334
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:06,204
   that powers the transmitter  
         for 150 hours.         

335
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,873
    they connect the battery    
       to the transmitter       

336
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,275
     in the fireproof box...    

337
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,411
     connect the transmitter    
        to the antennas,        

338
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,547
      then screw the cover      
     to the aluminum plates     

339
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,017
            embedded            
 around the cavity's perimeter. 

340
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,494
 the finished device undergoes  
 a series of performance tests. 

341
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,831
            this one,           
 in a special echo-free chamber,

342
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,366
       verifies the signal      
    the transmitter sends out   

343
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,901
        via the antennas.       

344
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,305
 the chamber's receiving antenna
   is connected to a computer   

345
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,640
          that analyzes         
     the signal's frequency     

346
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,175
   and transmission pattern --  

347
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,778
        critical factors        
      in recovering the box     

348
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,715
    that provides vital clues   
    for crash investigators.
