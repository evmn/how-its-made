      these days are opting     

6
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,691
      to seal their bottles     
    with technological corks.   

7
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,126

12
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,708

13
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,009
  like the traditional stoppers 

14

     that are cut and shaped    
   from a solid piece of cork.  

15
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,381

     only very differently.     

17
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,520
        cork is the bark        
      of the cork oak tree.     

18
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,390
      once the tree reaches     
         the age of 25,         

19
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,594
it can be harvested for its bark
    once every decade or so.    

20
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,198
   a specialized worker makes   
   cuts in the bark with an ax  

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,333
 using a very specific technique

22
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,768
   that doesn't harm the tree.  

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,307
   using the handle of the ax,  
  he gently pries off the bark. 

24
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,844
   a cork oak typically lives   
          for 300 years         

25
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:55,847
      and can be harvested      
         up to 15 times.        

26
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,451
  upon receiving planks of cork 
       from the supplier,       

27
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,422
 the technological cork factory 
breaks them into small pieces...

28
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,227
   ...then grinds those pieces  
         into granules,         

29
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,796
      and then stores them      
          in huge bags.         

30
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,669
   the first step is to empty   
       the bags into silos      

31
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,240
            that feed           
   the purification equipment.  

32
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,843
   the machines, which purify   
       the cork granules,       

33
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,913
      are giant autoclaves.     

34
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:32,017
      workers fill each one     
     with a ton of granules.    

35
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,619
then they start up a compressor,

36
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:38,157
   which simultaneously heats   
 and pressurizes carbon dioxide 

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,293
    that then transforms into   
        a semiliquid gas        

38
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,962
    called supercritical co2,   

39
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,065
   which is an environmentally  
        friendly solvent.       

40
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,836
  they inject the supercritical 
     co2 into the autoclave     

41
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,906
   and wash the granules in it  
          for 3 hours.          

42
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,311
     the factory's in-house     
    laboratory then analyzes    

43
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,581
        and compares pre-       
  and postpurification samples  

44
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,716
      drawn from each batch     

45
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,185
       to ensure there are      
     no offending molecules     

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,687
   remaining after treatment.   

47
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,291
 a technician uses the technique
      of gas chromatography     

48
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,795
      to separate molecules     
  by their size and structure,  

49
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,598
       then the technique       
      of mass spectrometry      

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,669
to measure the electrical signal
    that each molecule emits.   

51
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:27,473
       the type of signal       
identifies the type of molecule.

52
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:30,442
       the signal strength      
     indicates its quantity.    

53
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,178
       once the batch gets      
  the green light from the lab, 

54
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,715
    the manufacturer mixes it   
 with a food-safe binding agent 

55
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,384
     and transfers the batch    
      to the molding line.      

56
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,887
     the molding machine is     
       computer-controlled      

57
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,855
     to automatically adjust    
            the molds           

58
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,058
      to the dimensions of      
   the stopper being produced.  

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,128
 the machine pours the cork mix 
         into the molds,        

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,332
   which then go into an oven   
       for a few minutes.       

61
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:56,000
    the ingredients bake into   
         a solid stopper        

62
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,304
   with just the right degree   
         of elasticity.         

63
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,708
 every stopper made in the same 
    mold shape is identical,    

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,911
     but no two stoppers cut    
  from the whole pieces of cork 

65
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:11,416
 are ever the same because cork 
     has natural variations.    

66
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,586
    this is merely the cork's   
       preliminary shape.       

67
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,958
        a computer-guided       
  machining center refines them 

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,894
  to exactly the shape ordered. 

69
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,063
after finalizing the dimensions,

70
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,899
      the machine chamfers      
        one or both ends.       

71
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,369
   a chamfer is a beveled edge  
      that makes it easier      

72
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,271
       to insert the cork       
        into the bottle.        

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,041
     every cork then passes     
      in front of a camera,     

74
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,511
   which detects any defects.   

75
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,046
      this machine conducts     
       a permeability test      

76
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,382
on a few samples from each batch

77
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,619
   to measure how much oxygen   
       flows past the cork      

78
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,589
      when it's in position     
         in the bottle.         

79
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,624
      the corks are usually     
          custom-marked         

80
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,827
     for a specific winery.     

81
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,296
   some wineries order a model  
      that looks more like      

82
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,134
      a traditional stopper     
 cut from a solid piece of cork.

83
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,572
 that type requires a couple of 
     extra production steps.    

84
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,641
        a branding stamp        
     burns lines on the top.    

85
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,477
  then a computer-guided laser  
         burns a pattern        

86
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,313
 around the side of the stopper 

87
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,015
      to mimic the texture      
        of natural cork.        

88
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,454
    the last step is to brand   
    the winery-specific words   

89
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,890
           and images.          

90
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,829
    the cork goes from ground   
 cork bark to a finished stopper

91
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,165
       and then to a final      
        visual inspection       

92
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,234

00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,318
       the speed and depth      
        of the zinc blend       

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,454
      to prevent overflow.      

127
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,360
   the molten zinc now arrives  
     at the casting machine.    

128
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,195
              here,             
   3-foot-wide steel unwinds,   

129
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,999
        and once linear,        
     the zinc flows onto it.    

130
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,435
    the steel acts as a mold    
        to form the zinc        

131
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,404
    into a long rigid sheet.    

132
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,043
    water flows onto the zinc   
      to accelerate cooling     

133
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,478
       and solidification.      

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,115
   since water and liquid zinc  
           don't mix,           

135
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:05,717
        the water simply        
      runs off the surface.     

136
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:12,457
    now solid, the zinc plate   
 is almost 1/3 of an inch thick,

137
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,927
    far too thick for making    
    lightweight rain gutters.   

138
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,631
  the next operation will thin  
  the plate down dramatically.  

139
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:23,735
this is a powerful rolling mill.

140
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,204
   the pressure on its rollers  
           is so great          

141
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:30,141
      that they often must      
          be replaced.          

142
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,210
      once the new rollers      
        have been loaded,       

143
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,013
     the mill heats them up.    

144
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,216
          the operator          
     activates the rollers.     

145
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:43,588
as they revolve, the hot rollers
   exert 770 tons of pressure   

146
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,125
 to iron the zinc much thinner. 

147
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,993
     meanwhile, just ahead,     

148
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,131
 a steel belt tensioning system 
       swings into action.      

149
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,101
 this system prevents slackening
        in the zinc sheet       

150
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,138
  as it exits the rolling mill  
       and moves forward.       

151
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,740
   you can see the difference   
      the rolling has made.     

152
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,209
  it has reduced the thickness  
        of the zinc sheet       

153
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,214
  to about 3/4 of a millimeter. 

154
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:13,151
 the steel-belt system maintains
  the tension in the zinc sheet 

155
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,787
  as it's wound around a core.  

156
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,858
          this produces         
    the 46-ton coil of zinc.    

157
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,960
 it's known as the mother coil. 

158
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,529
     approximately 25 miles     
         of rain gutters        

159
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,066
   can be made from this coil.  

160
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,735
  workers slit the mother coil  
           into three.          

161
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,139
    each coil is a foot wide.   

162
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,876
   it is now the correct width  
 to be formed into rain gutters.

163
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,413
      a crane lifts one of      
       the narrower coils       

164
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,315
     over the factory floor.    

165
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,319
      its journey is guided     
     by the operator below.     

166
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,258
 this puts it in position to be 
  mounted to the next machine,  

167
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,496
    one that will cut it into   
  uniform 13-foot-long strips.  

168
00:09:57,498 --> 00:10:01,233
   that's the standard length   
      for the rain gutters.     

169
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,102
      as the zinc uncoils,      
       an overhead mirror       

170
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,738
       provides a top view      
        for the operator.       

171
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,777
   in quick swoops, the blade   
    slices the zinc sheeting    

172
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,414
     to the correct length.     

173
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,282
         the zinc strips        
       then travel through      

174
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,419
 a progressively narrow channel 

175
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,320
      and over a cylinder.      

176
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:26,190
    this rounds the profile.    

177
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,927
      more rollers improve      
         on the u-shape         

178
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,464
   and also curl the edges of   
 the gutters to reinforce them. 

179
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,770
this gives the zinc rain gutters
       their final shape.       

180
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:43,708
  the automated profiler ejects 
    the 13-foot-long gutters    

181
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,910
      onto a rounded rack.      

182
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,979
          then it tips          
      to stack the gutters

   the basque country piebald,  
 referring to the animal's skin.

    this pig breed is native    
      to the basque region      

203
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,226
   where livestock are raised

205
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,166

  commercially farmed animals,  

206
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:18,603
   the female pigs have small   
 litters of six to nine piglets,

207
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,571
      which grow up roaming

208
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,774

209
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,711

210
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,581

    this free-range rearing,    

211
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,016
    the pigs grow more slowly   

212
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,286
       and become heavier       
 than commercially farmed pigs. 

213
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:40,225
 once the animals reach a weight

dry salt on the exposed portion.

221

248

    nature does all the work.   

249
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,919
     humans merely regulate     
    the airflow and humidity    

250
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,990
           by lifting           
     or lowering the blinds.    

251
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,658
   in this room, the ham hangs  

252
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,828
    from a wooden rather than   
      stainless-steel rack.     

253
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,764
     that's because the wood    
     absorbs excess humidity    

254
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,966
     and transfers moisture     
           to the meat          

255
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,535
    if the air gets too dry.    

256
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,574
        as the ham dries,       
    its flavor concentrates.    

257
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,676
         the charcutier,        
   an artisanal pork butcher,

00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,046
  inspects every ham carefully. 

259
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,153
   the wind that dries the ham  
         carries pollen         

260
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,589
  and other natural particles,  

261
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,594
       which give this ham      
a distinct flavor and fragrance.

262
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,329
    the secret is slow curing   

263
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,233
      until the ham reaches     
        optimal maturity.       

264
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,837
    that takes approximately    
      1 month per 2 pounds,     

265
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,172
       so the ham remains

      for more than a year.
