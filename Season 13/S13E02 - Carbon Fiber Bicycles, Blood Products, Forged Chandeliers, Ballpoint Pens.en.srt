00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,920
            narrator:           
 carbon fibers are minute hairs 

2
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:55,588
     of almost pure carbon.     

3
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,056
        they may be tiny,       

4
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,590
but they're three times stronger

5
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,726
     and four times lighter     
           than steel.          

6
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,196
    weaving them together and   
bonding them with plastic resin,

7
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,932
   then molding this material   
        into a bike frame       

8
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,236
     creates one lean, mean     
        peddling machine.       

9
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,409
 this company builds custom-made
      carbon fiber bicycles     

10
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,546
    for professional athletes   
      and serious amateurs.     

11
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,949
    the first step is to take   
    detailed measurements --    

12
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,051
height, weight, and limb length,

13
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,021
    as well as shoulder width   
     for handlebar spacing,     

14
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,889
 inseam for the seat placement, 

15
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,425
       and even shoe size       
 for the positioning the pedals,

16
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,761
  relative to the front wheel.  

17
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,132
        computer software       
      translates these data     

18
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:44,036
    into a geometric diagram    
   of a customized bike frame.  

19
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,772
  a cutting machine slices out  
       carbon fiber shapes      

20
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,108
        that will become        
      the frame components.     

21
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,714
        the bicycle frame       
    is made up of nine parts.   

22
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,183
       they make each one       
      with an aluminum mold     

23
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,453
       and a latex balloon      
        called a bladder.       

24
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:09,528
      they wrap the bladder     
  with a layer of carbon fiber. 

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,865
   the fibers in the material   
   all run in one direction.    

26
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,600
       so to add strength,      
    they apply several layers   

27
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,770
          in a specific         
       crisscross pattern.      

28
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,341
  after coating the mold cavity 
      with a release agent      

29
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,542
      to prevent sticking,      

30
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:25,745
           they place           
   the wrapped bladder inside,  

31
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:28,280
 then install an inflation cap. 

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,022
       they place the mold      
  in a specialized heat press,  

33
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:39,024
    hook up pressurized gas,    

34
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,227
    then insert a temperature   
      and pressure monitor.     

35
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,497
      the inflated bladder      
     forces the carbon fiber    

36
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,166
        to take the shape       
       of the mold cavity.      

37
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:53,506
     after about 20 minutes,    
  they extract the molded part, 

38
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,907
then begin the refining process.

39
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,976
      first, they sand off      

40
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,513
   any release-agent residue.   

41
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,849
   then they machine the part   
     to exact specifications    

42
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,986
       for a precision fit      
   with its connecting parts.   

43
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,188
following the geometric diagram,

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,224
 they assemble the bicycle frame
         like a puzzle.         

45
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,346
  once they're sure everything  
     fits together properly,    

46
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,148
  they disassemble the pieces,  

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,883
    then coat the connectors    

48
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,386
        with superstrong        
       aerospace adhesive.      

49
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,365
   they reassemble the parts,   

50
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,435
  then cure the glue in an oven 
     for about a half-hour.     

51
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,276
   the bicycle frame now goes   
   onto an inspection table.    

52
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,915
          a technician          
uses digital measuring equipment

53
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,184
     to ensure the alignment    
           is perfect.          

54
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,191
          the next step         
    is to install test wheels   

55
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,927
   and check that they rotate   
       perfectly straight.      

56
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,597
       back to the frame.       

57
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,999
   they remove any excess glue  
         that oozed out         

58
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,802
when they slid the part together

59
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,071
       and give the frame       
       an overall sanding.      

60
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:36,175
  the surface must be perfectly 
smooth before they can paint it.

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,481
they do all the painting by hand
        with spray guns.        

62
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:46,017
   first, they coat the frame   
     in a primer and sealer.    

63
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,754
     then they use a series     
      of adhesive stencils      

64
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,323
    to apply the paint colors   
         one at a time.         

65
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,064
      they spray on a coat      
  of clear automotive lacquer.  

66
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,601
     this protects the paint    
against u.v. light and chipping.

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,107
      next, using this tap,     

68
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,510
        they remove paint       
  that dried inside the threads 

69
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,911
   and the base of the frame,   

70
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:15,414
    where the gear mechanisms   
            screw on.           

71
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,386
   they repeat this procedure   
   at the head of the frame,    

72
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,522
  where the handlebars attach.  

73
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,258
     now it's just a matter     

74
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,326
          of installing         
     the specific components    

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,062
   that the customer ordered.   

76
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,599
 the carbon fiber frame delivers
 maximum strength and stiffness 

77
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,000
      with minimal weight.      

78
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,038
  it's the key to the bicycle's 
      high-end performance.     

79
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,157
  narrator: the average person  
    has 5 1/3 quarts of blood   

80
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,159
  running through their veins.  

81
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:03,629
  out of this blood come three  
 products that can save lives --

82
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,298
         red blood cells        
       that carry oxygen,       

83
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,634
            platelets           
    that help stop bleeding,    

84
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,036
           and plasma,          
      a protein-rich liquid     

85
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,439
 that helps us fight infection. 

86
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:22,113
 hospitals need all blood types 
    to help them save lives.    

87
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,618
    one day, your life could    
    depend on donated blood.    

88
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,788
         in this setup,         

89
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,858
      an automated machine      
   collects the donor's blood   

90
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,125
        and separates it        

91
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,295
according to which blood product
           they need.           

92
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:41,467
  the collection machine draws  
 whole blood from a donor's arm 

93
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,470
        and separates out       
 the mixed plasma and platelets,

94
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,405
  which is the color of straw.  

95
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,077
         in every setup,        

96
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,013
     some blood is diverted     
    into a pouch for testing.   

97
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,015
         in this method,        
 they're collecting whole blood 

98
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,486
     that will be separated     
           at the lab.          

99
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:03,021
    a worker then draws blood   
         from the pouch         

100
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,490
     for testing at the lab.    

101
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,762
     meanwhile, the machine     
     mixes the whole blood      

102
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,400
      with an anticoagulant     
  so it won't clot in the bag.  

103
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,375
    the donors' blood samples   
       then go to the lab,      

104
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,044
      where they determine      
         the blood type         

105
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:27,346
            and test            
    for infectious diseases.    

106
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,117
 this high-volume, high-quality 
      blood-testing machine     

107
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,520
            is unique           
   to the blood-banking world.  

108
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:38,323
fully automated, it helps ensure
 the safety of the blood supply 

109
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,725
    by testing donor samples    

110
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,629
 for things like hepatitis b, c,
           and h.i.v.           

111
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,534
     in eight hours, it runs    
   five different blood tests   

112
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:52,404
       on 1,000 donations       
   without human intervention.  

113
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,615
  between each of these tests,  

114
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,952
it sterilizes every single probe
       in a wash solution.      

115
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,023
         another machine        
   determines the blood type,   

116
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,291
    of which there are eight.   

117
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,298
            they scan           
   the donor's collection bag   

118
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,369
 and document what products they
  will produce from the blood.  

119
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,605
       then they weigh it.      

120
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,777
           overnight,           
    gravity causes the blood    

121
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,312
           to separate          
   into its three components,   

122
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,247
    so a worker re-mixes it,    

123
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,318
          preparing it          
     for machine separation.    

124
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,526
    she then packs the blood    
           in the bags          

125
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,795
    for the other components    
   into what's called a liner.  

126
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,198
    she makes sure the liners   
          are balanced          

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,601
  and will put a rubber weight  
    inside when she needs to.   

128
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,737
      balancing the liners      
  keeps the centrifuge machine  

129
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,808
 spinning properly at 4,000 rpm,

130
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,978
    as it separates the blood   
          into layers.          

131
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,022
   she then hooks up the unit   
       of separated blood       

132
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,891
    to an automated extractor   

133
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,128
        and, once again,        
matches the unit with the donor.

134
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,570
   the extractor fills a bag    
   with just red blood cells.   

135
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,373
  as the machine fills the bag, 

136
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,975
   it leaves behind a mixture   
     of blood and platelets     

137
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,844
   in the original container.   

138
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,251
         as it extracts         
      these red blood cells     

139
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,121
   and leaves behind a portion  
     of blood and platelets,    

140
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,758
 it also fills another container
        with pure plasma.       

141
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,464
an incubator keeps the processed
      platelets well-mixed.     

142
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,868
    they only have five days    
    to use these platelets.     

143
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,276
   however, they freeze plasma  

144
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,678
  and can use it for 12 months. 

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,947
    finally, they filter out    

146
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,283
      the white blood cells     
    from the red blood cells,   

147
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,752
       using what's called      
    a leukoreduction filter.    

148
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,759
      they also introduce       
      an additive solution      

149
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,094
    into the red blood cells    

150
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,630
    and mix it all together.    

151
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,634
   the additive helps the red   
blood cells survive for 42 days,

152
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,235
      both inside a fridge      

153
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:41,240
    and during transportation   
        to the hospitals.       

154
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,592
            narrator:           
  today most forged chandeliers 

155
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,093
   are wired for electricity.   

156
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,929
   we've replaced the candles   
      used in earlier times     

157
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,299
      with decorative bulbs     
         and lampshades.        

158
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,733
     but a forged chandelier    

159
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,870
   still relies on traditional  
    blacksmithing techniques    

160
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,206
      and the hand assembly     
          of components         

161
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,742
         used in modern         
       lighting fixtures.       

162
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,617
            to build            
   this two-tiered chandelier,  

163
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,054
  the artisan begins by making  
     the twist-basket shape.    

164
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,162
         first, he cuts         
      lengths of steel bar      

165
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,364
   with this shearing machine.  

166
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,969
  he arranges six of those bars 
          in a bundle,          

167
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,905
      held firmly together      
    by this welding fixture.    

168
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,780
   he welds the bars together,  
  leaving a hole in the center, 

169
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,682
     through which the wires    
           will pass.           

170
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,387
    a worker puts the bundle    
          into a forge          

171
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,458
 that softens the steel at more 
 than 1,800 degrees fahrenheit. 

172
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,198
  she then mounts the softened  
  bundle in a twisting machine, 

173
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,734
  securing it tightly in place. 

174
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:26,210
      she turns the wheel,      
  spiraling the bars together.  

175
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,013
  she then reverses the wheel,  

176
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,682
causing the center of the bundle
           to pop out,          

177
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,784
            creating            
    the twist-basket design.    

178
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,124
    she makes sure the shape    
         is symmetrical.        

179
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,564
  then she verifies its length  
           in a gauge.          

180
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:49,901
   next, they clean the basket  
      with tiny steel beads     

181
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,837
          in a process          
      called bead blasting.     

182
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,643
         here, they make        
        the j-shaped arms       

183
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,512
     used for the upper tier    
        of the chandelier       

184
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:01,913
       from metal tubing,       

185
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,017
    which they shape in this    
    rotary bending machine.     

186
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,860
     with the same machine,     
they also make the s-shaped arms

187
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,662
     used for the lower tier    
       of the chandelier.       

188
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,798
    all the arms are hollow,    

189
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
     which will allow wires     
     to pass through them.      

190
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,205
   a vibrating ceramic medium   
then polishes all the components

191
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,340
   that make up the chandelier  

192
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,510
  to give them a smooth finish. 

193
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,679
    using a mounting fixture,   

194
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,282
         a worker places        
     the polished upper arms    

195
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,151
 in what's called a distributor.

196
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,956
        he welds the arms       
       to the distributor,      

197
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,491
    which both supports them    

198
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,760
         and gives them         
      the proper alignment.     

199
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:56,268
     he welds the lower arms    
     to another distributor.    

200
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,444
   next, he welds metal tubing  

201
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:08,180
          onto each end         
      of the twist basket.      

202
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,182
  this tubing makes it possible 

203
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,218
           to connect           
 all the decorative components. 

204
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,325
     a worker then attaches     
  those decorative components,  

205
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,061
     which includes a loop      
     to hang the chandelier     

206
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,531
  and an end cap that attaches  
       to the distributor.      

207
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,402
  she completes what is called  
         the center core        

208
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,337
    by tightening everything    
            in place.           

209
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,143
         then they spray        
  the upper and the lower arms, 

210
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,746
  as well as the center cores,  
      with powder coating,      

211
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,014
     a finely ground plastic    

212
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,684
      about the consistency     
        of talcum powder.       

213
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,290
    the center cores and arms   
      then go into an oven,     

214
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,759
   where heat cures and bonds   
       the powder coating,      

215
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,562
 giving the parts a hard finish.

216
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,835
     a worker then connects     
    the upper and lower tiers   

217
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,171
           by fitting           
   the distributors together.   

218
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,373
           this hides           
     the wiring connections.    

219
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:15,647
   he secures the center core   
       to the distributors      

220
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,649
 using a decorative finial ball.

221
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,053
 he then puts candle sleeves on 

222
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,823
 to hide the light-bulb sockets 
           and wires.           

223
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,062
   the twist-basket chandelier  

224
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,531
          is now ready          
      to brighten your day.     

225
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,269
     forged chandeliers help    
  establish the mood of a room. 

226
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:41,072
  they come in various styles,  
  from classic to ultramodern,  

227
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,874
  and their designs are limited 

228
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,710
only by an artist's imagination.

229
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,962
            narrator:           
  in a world where inexpensive, 

230
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,298
    disposable ballpoint pens   
          are the norm,         

231
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,633
         there are still        
      discriminating people     

232
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,303
        who prefer using        
  a deluxe writing instrument.  

233
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,105
      a fancy, high-quality     
          ballpoint pen         

234
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,308
          is as stylish         
      as it is functional.      

235
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,910
        it's often paired       
     with a matching pencil     

236
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,712
     in an elegant gift set.    

237
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,852
         silver plated,         
       alligator leather,       

238
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:30,054
           chain mail,          
   rose gold with crystals --   

239
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,791
 pen casing designs are endless.

240
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,728
     this model is decorated    
          with lacquer          

241
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,930
      made from the resin       
      of a particular tree      

242
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,565
    that grows only in china.   

243
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,937
          they apply it         
      using a special brush     

244
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,405
       made of human hair.      

245
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,481
   coating the recessed areas   
      of a brass pen casing     

246
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,016
       creates the effect       
        of black stripes        

247
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,919
 running the length of the pen. 

248
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,896
      once the resin dries,     

249
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,431
they wash the pen several times.

250
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,568
    then, with a cotton wheel   
  and some polishing compound,  

251
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,337
     they buff the lacquer      
     to a high-gloss shine.     

252
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,651
      here's another model      
     with an etched design.     

253
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,185
    a computer-guided machine   

254
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,388
       engraves the fine,       
       intricate pattern        

255
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,789
     with a diamond chisel.     

256
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,323
      the casing is brass,      

257
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,726
      but they'll plate it      
      in a precious metal       

258
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,062
     such as gold, platinum,    
           or rhodium.          

259
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,005
every pen, regardless of design,

260
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,074
 has a brass or sheet-steel clip

261
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,577
        that coordinates        
    with the rest of the pen.   

262
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,415
     they position the clip     
           on a press,          

263
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,349
         and it applies         
      just enough pressure      

264
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,919
        to push tiny pegs       
     into holes in the cap.     

265
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,428
  the factory tests every clip  
     for tension resistance.    

266
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,564
        it has to stretch       
      to a certain extent,      

267
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,000
           then return          
     to its original shape.     

268
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,038
 the pen's tip is made of brass 

269
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,240
     plated in silver, gold,    
           or rhodium.          

270
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,910
  this machine drills the hole  

271
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:35,647
  through which the retractable 
    ballpoint will protrude.    

272
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:41,186
    this machine injects ink    
   inside the pen cartridges,   

273
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,987
    which are made of brass.    

274
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,456
  it then caps the writing end  
          with the tip          

275
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,525
        containing a tiny       
      stainless-steel ball.     

276
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,260
       as the pen writes,       

277
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,396
     the ball transfers ink     
          to the paper.         

278
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,466
           the machine          
    then flips the cartridge    

279
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,801
    in the opposite direction   

280
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,537
     and shoots some grease     
     through the other end.     

281
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,173
   this seals the ink inside.   

282
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,077
    now the filled cartridges   

283
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,479
          go for a ride         
    on a centrifuge machine,    

284
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,283
      which pushes the ink      
   down toward the ballpoint.   

285
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,285
this machine runs random samples

286
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,088
 through a quality-control test 
          for ink flow,         

287
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,889
     ensuring each cartridge    

288
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,160
      outputs 8 kilometers      
      of quality writing.       

289
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,963
  a twist mechanism at the top  

290
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,833
      extends and retracts      
    the cartridge writing tip   

291
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,501
      through the pen tip.      

292
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,636
 the factory tests the mechanism

293
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,874
     on each and every model    
       thousands of times.      

294
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,845
    now onto another model --   

295
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,381
       this one decorated       
         in chain mail.         

296
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:46,184
    workers cut the material    
         to pen length,         

297
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,953
         then fasten it         
  around the brass pen casing.  

298
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,927
  after several washes in water 
   and solvent-free detergent,  

299
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,529
   followed by several rinses,  

300
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,133
   they precision-glue the tip  
     and cap to the casing.     

301
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,145
 then they insert the cartridge,

302
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,680
       along with a spring      
      to provide resistance     

303
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,884
       when the ballpoint       
   presses against the paper.   

304
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,955
    finally, they cap the top   

305
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,358
    with either a push-button   
     mechanism like this one    

306
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,595
      or a twist mechanism      
        as we saw before.       

307
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,168
        before packaging,       

308
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,705
 every single pen undergoes one 
   last quality-control check   

309
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,508
       under magnification      
    to be absolutely certain    

310
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,910
   that even if your spelling   
            is poor,            

311
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,480
   your writing will be great.
