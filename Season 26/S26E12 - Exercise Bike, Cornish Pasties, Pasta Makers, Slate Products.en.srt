narrator: exercise bikes can provide a great cardio workout.            

4
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,058
their tension settings      

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,196
are equivalent to the gears on a road bike.         

6
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,532
cyclists can adjust the tension to control the intensity     

7
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,836
of their workout, all while staying in one place.             

8
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:19,277
riding an exercise bike can help burn calories,     

9
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,415
increase strength, and reach fitness goals.     

10
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:27,285
they start by making the bike frame,         

11
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,822
which includes the handlebars, saddle post,           

12
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,157
and flywheel housing.      

13
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,962
an employee places all the parts in a welding fixture.      

14
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,699
the welding system is computerized.         

15
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,634
the fixture moves the parts into position          

16
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:46,205
and a robot accurately     
welds the joints of the frame.  

17
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,045
it takes 20 welds to link all the parts of the bike frame.             

18
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,648
at the next station, a machine shapes the handlebars      

19
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,584
and saddle post to the correct profile.     

20
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,658
then, a worker polishes the welds with a wire brush.   

21
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:12,130
next, they apply a black plastic finish to the metal.       

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,201
this process is called powder coating.         

23
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:18,537
an employee applies a metallic decal of the company name    

24
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,072
to the powder-coated frame.   

25
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,278
he inserts the bearing for the pedal crank axle     

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,614
and gently taps it into place with a hammer.          

27
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,818
he attaches a circuit board to the base.           

28
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,222
it will control the resistance of the flywheel.         

29
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,624
he threads the wiring through the hollow frame     

30
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,326
and out the handlebar post.   

31
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,498
he drills holes in the saddle-bar tubing,    

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,735
then, he installs the post and adjustable locking screw.  

33
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:56,441
he installs a temporary clamping lever on the flywheel framework,           

34
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,078
which will be used to tension the transmission build.     

35
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,117
he installs the bike saddle.   

36
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:11,123
then, he uses a hydraulic system to press an axle and bearing   

37
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,825
into the center of the flywheel.            

38
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,133
he places a product-name decal on the flywheel.         

39
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,005
the cast-iron flywheel is the heart of the bike.    

40
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,476
at about 40 pounds, it's heavy enough to stabilize the bike   

41
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,044
during the stationary ride.   

42
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:40,018
he loops the transmission belt around the flywheel axle,    

43
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,288
then mounts the flywheel to the framework.        

44
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:48,894
he installs magnetic brakes and              
wires them to a bike computer.  

45
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,363
the brakes allow the rider to control the resistance    

46
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,631
during the ride.         

47
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,037
he connects the pulley disk to the front of the bike.    

48
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,976
then, he loops the other end of the transmission belt     

49
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,077
around the pulley disk.     

50
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,182
he uses a clamping lever to pull the belt tight.     

51
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,117
he strums it and measures the sound      

52
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,753
to confirm the tension is right.            

53
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,455
the next worker removes the clamp        

54
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,126
and places the bike in a test station.        

55
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,330
it spins the flywheel and applies resistance.     

56
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,665
a computer analyzes the bike's performance.     

57
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,803
another employee wires the switches        

58
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,038
for increasing and decreasing resistance.    

59
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,676
she tucks the wiring inside the handlebars.      

60
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,011
she attaches switches to the outside          

61
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,714
for easy access during the ride.         

62
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,888
she folds the lower half of the resistance wiring up   

63
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,057
and installs the wiring sleeve in between the handlebars.    

64
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,029
she screws the bracket to the handlebar housing,    

65
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,765
then, she connects the wires to the ride computer       

66
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,567
and attaches it to the bracket.            

67
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,770
she opens the computer      

68
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,707
and plugs the main power cable into the back.          

69
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,577
then, she reinstalls the computer's back panel.    

70
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,547
this completes the handlebar assembly.     

71
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,051
the next worker encases the transmission belt      

72
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:21,320
and electrical parts in a plastic housing.      

73
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,692
he attaches the pedals to the axle.           

74
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,929
then, he places plastic caps on the ends     

75
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,698
and hammers them into place.   

76
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,038
he packages the bike and    
handlebar assembly separately.  

77
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,680
this exercise bike is now ready to ride.      

78
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,816
it may be stationary,      
but, when it comes to fitness,  

79
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,819
this bike should help riders go the distance.     

80
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,769
a pasty is a common british meal consisting of          

81
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,171
meat and vegetables wrapped in a pastry.           

82
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,575
historically, the cornish pasty was served as a convenient meal              

83
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,577
for miners in the cornwall area of the united kingdom.      

84
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,647
the crimped edge served as a handle,       

85
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,849
allowing workers to enjoy their food       

86
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,285
without contaminating it with their dirty hands.     

87
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,924
the cornish pasty is the national dish       

88
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,926
of cornwall in the uk.      

89
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,327
its signature crimped edge,   

90
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,396
along with other characteristics,      

91
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,798
are culturally and commercially protected.   

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,866
under european union regulations,           

93
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,736
only pasties made the traditional way in cornwall   

94
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,772
can be sold as cornish pasties.            

95
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,211
the traditional recipe begins with pastry dough.    

96
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,147
workers combine lard and margarine          

97
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,417
with salt and flour.       

98
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,953
they mix these ingredients at low speeds          

99
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,690
so they don't overheat the fats.              

100
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,625
the solid fats break up gradually        

101
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,361
and combine with the flour and salt     

102
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,898
to form a bread-crumb-like texture.   

103
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,567
after about five minutes, they add water.         

104
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,502
then, they resume mixing, until the dough         

105
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,773
reaches the right consistency.  

106
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,709
they let the dough rest for about an hour.        

107
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,245
this relaxes the gluten in the flour,          

108
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,381
preventing the dough from shrinking when it bakes.  

109
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,116
they put it in an extruder,   

110
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34,520
which feeds it down an automated forming line.              

111
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:38,057
at the first station, the dough passes through several rollers,            

112
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,259
which progressively flatten it into a sheet.     

113
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,530
they add flour to the dough, so it doesn't stick to the rollers.            

114
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,135
the flattened dough finally exits the first station.     

115
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:56,141
the next station uses revolving cutters to slice the dough    

116
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,677
into 5-ounce disks.       

117
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,280
the excess dough is collected  

118
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,215
and reworked into the next batch.       

119
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,820
flattening and cutting the dough heats it up,      

120
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,556
so they put it in a refrigerator          

121
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,058
for about an hour, to restore its elasticity.    

122
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:22,034
meanwhile, they prepare the pasties' vegetable filling.            

123
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,973
workers load washed potatoes into an industrial peeler.    

124
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:32,211
it spins them inside an abrasive metal drum to remove the skins.             

125
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,985
then, the potatoes go through a dicer,         

126
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,588
which cuts them to a specific size.       

127
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,791
the dicer deposits the potatoes in water,      

128
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,862
to remove any excess starch.   

129
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,663
workers combine the potatoes   

130
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:55,934
with diced rutabaga and onion in a vegetable mixer.      

131
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,537
they add melted butter,     
to help caramelize the onions.  

132
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,777
they also add salt, pepper, and a blend of other seasonings.           

133
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,282
they run the mixer for about two minutes.      

134
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,221
then, the vegetable filling   

135
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,624
joins the other components on the production line.     

136
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,631
workers place the dough on a moving belt         

137
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,133
with the front edge of each disk on a white line.  

138
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,905
this position ensures that the depositor's nozzles   

139
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,773
drop the filling onto the right spot.       

140
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,979
next, workers place fresh, lean skirt steak         

141
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,515
on top of the vegetables.    

142
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:47,319
the steak is cut from      
the forequarter of prime beef.  

143
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,655
according to european union regulations,   

144
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:53,325
12.5% of a cornish pasty must be beef.          

145
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:57,362
this company's pasties exceed that, containing at least 17.5%.             

146
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,001
highly skilled workers      

147
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:06,071
close the cornish pasty with the signature crimped edge.              

148
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,808
they fold the dough in half,   

149
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,813
form 19 to 22 even crimps along the back of the pasty,   

150
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,216
then, neatly tuck the end.    

151
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,820
this must be done        
with both precision and speed.  

152
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:25,124
it takes these expert crimpers about 20 seconds per pasty.   

153
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,298
workers collect the pasties and make a small incision,    

154
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,067
to vent some moisture as the bake.           

155
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,506
the remaining juices will infuse the vegetables,   

156
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:42,508
producing a flavorful gravy.   

157
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,046
the factory immediately cools the finished cornish pasties   

158
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,716
to about 65 fahrenheit.     

159
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,552
this keeps the raw ingredients fresh during packaging.     

160
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,258
pasties are stored and shipped frozen,       

161
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,161
then glazed and baked onsite.  

162
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,999
after 45 to 50 minutes in the oven,           

163
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,402
these traditional cornish pasties are ready to serve.   

164
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,288
fresh pasta is made from a moist egg and flour dough   

165
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,893
that's mixed, kneaded, and rolled into a sheet.     

166
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,230
then, the dough is cut into soft noodles, ravioli,   

167
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:40,499
or other shapes, using a pasta maker.       

168
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,906
this italian-made industrial pasta maker      

169
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,510
is designed for restaurants and smaller pasta suppliers.   

170
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,648
the machine is only five feet wide,       

171
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,850
but it's still capable of mixing the dough       

172
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,653
and pressing it into a variety of pasta shapes.         

173
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,190
the machine can turn dough    

174
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:09,061
into ravioli or assorted types of long and short pasta.     

175
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,666
the machine's three stations --               

176
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,736
the extruder, the ravioli maker, and the pasta cutter --     

177
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,239
are constructed from stainless-steel parts.   

178
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,010
a computer-guided punch press  

179
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:28,346
makes the required holes and slots.            

180
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,682
workers insert pieces into a press           

181
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,085
to bend them to the required shape.      

182
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,856
this is a cover for one of the machine's components.   

183
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,265
once all the pieces are ready, workers weld them together.   

184
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,373
the machine's pasta cutter uses stainless-steel cutting rollers             

185
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,908
to slice the pasta.       

186
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,981
each roller starts out as a stainless-steal rod.    

187
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,051
a computer-guided mill carves grooves into it.     

188
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,588
the groove width determines the width of the pasta.     

189
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,391
the pasta cutter contains four pairs of rollers      

190
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,193
that cut the pasta to different widths:       

191
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,529
2-millimeter-wide taglionlini,  

192
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:22,133
4-millimeter-wide fettuccine,  
8-millimeter-wide tagliatelle,  

193
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,003
and 12-millimeter-wide pappardelle.           

194
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,539
rollers are available in additional sizes.       

195
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,410
workers install four corresponding pairs     

196
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,946
of steel combs underneath the rollers.     

197
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,883
the combs gently scrape the dough out of the grooves   

198
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,818
to eject the cut pasta.     

199
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:49,027
next, workers install the gears that turn the rollers.      

200
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,029
the gears engage one another,  

201
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,299
so that the rollers revolve at the same speed.        

202
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:58,970
this ensures that the cutter  
operates smoothly and quietly.  

203
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,541
the motor turns the larger main gear, which moves the others.  

204
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,246
they mount protective covers.  

205
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,848
this critical safety feature   

206
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,684
prevents users' fingers from  
getting caught in the rollers.  

207
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,722
at the base of the cutter,    

208
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,925
they mount a smooth laminating roller.        

209
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,994
this roller thins the dough sheet      

210
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,763
before the cutting rollers slice it.        

211
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,801
they install the electrically powered motor    

212
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,203
that turns the main gear.    

213
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,477
then, the handle that moves the laminating roller.      

214
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,151
here, they've removed the protective covers      

215
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,587
to demonstrate how the cutting rollers operate.   

216
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,426
next, they build the extruder.  

217
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,428
they mount a blade in the dough mixer        

218
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,397
and connect it to an electric motor.      

219
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,503
the extrusion tube is located directly below the dough mixer.             

220
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,638
the dough is pushed through a bronze die       

221
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,040
in the extrusion tube.      

222
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:12,778
the dies can be changed to make different types of pasta.    

223
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,646
one die makes a flat sheet of dough,      

224
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,616
for cutting long pasta or making ravioli.        

225
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,520
other dies can be used to make short pasta,       

226
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,923
such as fusilli or rotini.    

227
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,595
the machine's third station is the motorized ravioli maker.             

228
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,731
it also has interchangeable dies,      

229
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,633
to make different shapes of ravioli.           

230
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,804
now, this machine is ready to make pasta.     

231
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,073
first, they pour in the dough ingredients      

232
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,209
and mix for 15 minutes.     

233
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,612
then, they pull a lever to feed the dough through the extruder.            

234
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,881
this is the die that makes a dough sheet     

235
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,851
for the long pasta cutter or ravioli maker.        

236
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,089
they cut the dough off the extruder         

237
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,226
and put it through the cutter's laminating roller to thin it.  

238
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,094
then, they feed it through the rollers       

239
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,898
in one of the cutting slots.   

240
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,235
to make ravioli,        
they extrude two narrow sheets  

241
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,037
and put them through the ravioli maker.    

242
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,373
a tube injects the filling between the sheets        

243
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,110
before the die crimps them together.      

244
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,112
a cooling system built into the extruder        

245
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,714
prevents the dough from heating up         

246
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,250
as it's forced through the die.              

247
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:28,753
this keeps the pasta fresh for a long time.         

248
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,402
slate was originally used to make roof shingles,      

249
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,404
as well as floor and wall tiles,             

250
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:51,609
but, now, this metamorphic rock is used all over the house.   

251
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,211
artisans are using slate to create everyday items,    

252
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,747
including tableware, address plaques,         

253
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,517
and garden accessories.     

254
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,957
these cornish slate products use              
traditional building materials  

255
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,559
in nontraditional ways.     

256
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,363
in cornwall,           

257
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,298
they have been mining slate for hundreds of years.      

258
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,503
some of the craftsman's slate is old roof           

259
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:22,173
or floor tile retrieved from the demolition sites.    

260
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,243
other projects require new slate, fresh from the quarry.  

261
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,512
the craftsman selects      

262
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,848
and older piece from a cheese board.       

263
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,651
he evaluates the color, as well as the thickness and shape.   

264
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,788
older slate is weathered and has more colors running through it.               

265
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,796
he scrapes the loose slate off the surface,         

266
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,264
working carefully to avoid    

267
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,900
fracturing the stone's thin layers.           

268
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,804
he sweeps off the scrapings.   

269
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,344
he scrubs the slate tile with a chemical cleaning solution   

270
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,046
and rinses off the residue.   

271
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,217
the slate dries in minutes.   

272
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,288
as the water evaporates,    
the color changes dramatically  

273
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,791
from dark gray to light gray with a bluish hue.        

274
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,228
he measures the slate for cutting           

275
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,765
and scores it lightly with a sharp tool.        

276
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,500
he places a template for the handle          

277
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,936
within the scored boundaries and marks it for drilling.    

278
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,710
then, he cuts the slate with a slate guillotine.     

279
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,513
it's a double-bladed tool similar to a paper cutter.    

280
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,884
he leaves a margin for trimming.            

281
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,191
he breaks off the margin     

282
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:49,794
by tapping it with a special slater's tool   

283
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,364
and checks the edges, to confirm that they're neat.  

284
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:59,070
then, he redefines the markings for the handle holds.      

285
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,339
the craftsman drills holes through the slate        

286
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,809
for the handles.         

287
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,544
then, he changes the drill bit  

288
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,213
to cut a sloped profile into the holes.         

289
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:12,684
this will allow the screws to sit flush against the slate.             

290
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,357
he brushes the edges, to get rid of loose chips,    

291
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,660
and refines the ends with a razor blade.       

292
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,865
the craftsman washes the slate one more time.          

293
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:34,105
the glues four small silicone knobs onto the base.       

294
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,973
the knobs act as legs,      

295
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:40,178
so the cheese plate can be set on any surface.    

296
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,248
he applies two coats of     
food-safe sealer to the slate.  

297
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,318
each coat takes a day to dry.  

298
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,888
then, he installs the stainless-steel handles.   

299
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,830
this slate cheese board is now ready to hold a few snacks.   

300
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,271
from an old roof tile to a nice piece of tableware.  

301
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,939
it's quite a transformation.   

302
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,481
next, the craftsman slices    

303
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,617
a block of new slate with a wet saw.         

304
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,355
new slate comes in thicker chunks.        

305
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,124
it can be used to make signage.            

306
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,565
he uses eight different grades of diamond abrasive pads     

307
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,802
to polish the surface until it's completely flat.   

308
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,106
then, he uses a computerized graphic cutter          

309
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,641
to make a stencil out of vinyl.             

310
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,980
he places the stencil over the slate          

311
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,149
and sandblasts it with a special compound.     

312
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:58,523
the process creates rough grooves in the slate.      

313
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,493
the grooves will allow paint to adhere to the stone.  

314
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,463
another employee uses the stencil         

315
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,134
to apply paint to the slate.   

316
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,069
she allows each coat of the paint to dry       

317
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,637
before brushing on the next.   

318
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,677
she applies four coats in total.             

319
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,247
when she's finished, she peels off the vinyl.     

320
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:30,755
this custom slate sign is ready of face the street.   

321
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:34,826
it takes four days to craft, seal, and paint the sign.    

322
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,294
now that it's complete,     

323
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,130
the sign is sure to make a rock-solid impression.
