    to an assembly carousel.    

246
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,807
            one half

  the carousel's first station. 

249
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,886

      to the next station,      

250
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:45,690
     which inserts a radial     
ball bearing in the center hole.

00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:50,162
 the next station places a stamp
        without dimples.        

252
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,831
        a press squeezes        
       the parts together       

253
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,702

      the non-dimpled half.     

254
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,906
    a magnetic arm transfers    
     the pulley to a track,     

255
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,774
 leading to a projection welder.

256
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:06,043
 the welder applies an electric 
     current to the dimples,    

257
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,515
     melting the two halves     
 together at the contact points.

258
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,985
     a robotic arm positions    
 the pulley on the next station,

259
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,923
  which presses a bore adapter  
 into the center of the bearing.

260
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:21,059
 this adapter enables the pulley
         to be installed        

261
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,994
      with a smaller bolt.      

262
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,598

  adapter also acts as a spacer 

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,269
     to align the center of     
 the pulley with the belt path. 

264
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,739
  next, the samples are tested  
       for weld strength.       

265
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,009
     a hydraulic jaw clamps     
     one half of the pulley     

266
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,213
     while another jaw pulls    
      the other half apart.     

267
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:45,149
  the welds must remain intact  
        to pass the test.       

268
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:49,087
  split pulleys undergo a weld  
    strength test on the hub.

       he joins the temple      
     and frame front hinges     

368
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,078
   with a nylon-coated screw.   

369
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,481
           the coating          
   tightens the parts together  

370
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:19,851
      and helps the temples     
    fold and unfold smoothly.   

371
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,821
     a craftsman hand files     
           the angles           

372
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:29,294
    so there's no gap between   
    temples and frame front.    

373
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,496
   each frame is hand-polished  

374
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,965
    with progressively finer    
         buffing wheels         

375
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,035
          and different         
      polishing compounds.      

376
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:43,307
 optical frames are shipped out 
 with temporary plastic lenses, 

377
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,042
   which an optician replaces   

378
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,246
       with the customer's      
      prescription lenses.      

379
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,716
  this mechanical machine cuts  
    the plastic to the shape    

380
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,453
    of the frame's eyeholes,    
     following a model lens.    

381
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,525
    the temporary lenses have   
     a bevel on their edge,     

382
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,260
         which fits into        
  the lens groove of the frame. 

383
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,129
      from start to finish,     

384
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:08,933
  it takes two weeks to create  
    a single pair of frames.    

385
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,804
     the process takes over     
 70 different production steps, 

386
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,974
     more than half of which    
     are performed manually.
