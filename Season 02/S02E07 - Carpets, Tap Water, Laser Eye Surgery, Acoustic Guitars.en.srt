00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,757
narrator: today on "how it's made,"

4
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,293
carpets,

5
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,028
drinking water,

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,830
laser-eye surgery,

7
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,633
and acoustic guitars.

8
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:41,372
people use the words "rug" and "carpet" interchangeably,

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,242
but they're not the same thing.

10
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,711
a rug covers just part of the floor.

11
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,846
a carpet goes wall to wall.

12
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:52,017
today most carpets on the market
are made of synthetic materials.

13
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,123
the first step is to make the carpet yarn.

14
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,860
they start by feeding bales of nylon or polyester fiber

15
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,462
into the opening and blending machine.

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,867
the carding machine then untangles the individual fibers,

17
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,735
lining them up in neat rows,

18
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,006
then gathering them into wider bands.

19
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,617
the bands go into cans.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,570
from the cans,

21
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:48,106
they go into a machine called a drawing frame...

22
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,175
which draws out five threads

23
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,778
to make one rough, loose thread.

24
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,520
that thread goes onto spools.

25
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,590
then they twist threads from two spools

26
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,160
to make a stronger and thicker thread.

27
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,137
next they twist two of those threads together

28
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,840
to form a two-ply yarn.

29
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,558
to ensure the two plies don't untwist,

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,560
the yarn goes through a heat-setting machine

31
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,631
at almost 270 degrees fahrenheit.

32
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,033
the continuous heat permanently sets it,

33
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,702
much the way a curling iron sets hair.

34
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,971
after 45 seconds of heat-setting,

35
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,574
the yarn is rewound on spools.

36
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,850
those spools then go to the tufting department,

37
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,986
where the carpet-making begins.

38
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,522
a standard 144-inch-wide carpet

39
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,461
is made from 1,440 spools of yarn.

40
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,797
each spool feeds into a plastic tube,

41
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,132
which feeds into the tufting machine,

42
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,269
where the 1,440 lines of yarn

43
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,506
feed 1,440 tufting needles.

44
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,480
the needles stitch the yarn

45
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,617
into a canvas backing made of polypropylene.

46
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,018
with slow motion,

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,355
you can see the yarn being hooked on the canvas

48
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:47,492
then cut underneath into carpet pile.

49
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:51,963
up to 12 needles work each inch of canvas.

50
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,434
the result is a pile carpet in the standard 12-foot width.

51
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,503
next they dye it.

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,307
for multicolored carpets,

53
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,910
they use a machine called a chromojet.

54
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,179
it works much the way a computer ink-jet printer does,

55
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,582
forcing streams of dye in different colors

56
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,051
into the carpet fibers.

57
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,721
the more complicated and colorful the design,

58
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:19,324
the more often the machine passes over the carpet.

59
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:23,128
for solid-color dyeing, there's
a mixer in each dye reservoir

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,731
to keep the color even.

61
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,066
they soak the carpet for four hours

62
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,535
in a hot bath of dye and water

63
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,805
heated to 212 degrees fahrenheit.

64
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:38,209
another method uses heat and air pressure in an autoclave.

65
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,144
what the bath method does in four hours,

66
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,480
this method does in just 30 minutes

67
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,550
and with more carpets at a time.

68
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,552
once the dyeing is finished,

69
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,956
they apply a water-based glue to a polypropylene backing

70
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,626
then put the backing over the original canvas backing,

71
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,563
locking the carpet fibers in place.

72
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,433
then it's on to what's called the marriage roll,

73
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,837
a roller press that marries the two backings together.

74
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,040
after a quick run through an oven

75
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,242
to make the water and the glue evaporate,

76
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,611
they cut the finished carpet into rolls.

77
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,683
a standard roll is 100 feet long.

78
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,863
narrator: researchers have invented a pollution-free car

79
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,732
that runs on hydrogen.

80
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,601
the research team modified the standard car engine

81
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,670
to burn hydrogen instead of gasoline.

82
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,873
now they have to figure out

83
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,011
how to prevent the hydrogen tank
from blowing up in a collision.

84
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,955
drinking water that's fresh, clean, and crystal-clear

85
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,491
is something many of us take for granted.

86
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,026
we might not give it a second thought,

87
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,295
but between the source and our tap,

88
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,733
a lot happens to make that water fit to drink.

89
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,438
our water may come from mother nature,

90
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,307
but it's far from pristine.

91
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,909
it starts its journey to the treatment plant

92
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,311
through a water-intake pipe.

93
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,381
on the wall of that pipe, about 6 1/2 feet down,

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,049
is a 6-inch hole.

95
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,452
covering that hole is a metal grill

96
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,922
designed to keep out large debris, such as tree branches.

97
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,595
the water flows to the pumping station,

98
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,865
where it goes through a preliminary screening.

99
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:44,202
a giant revolving screen removes
fish, garbage, and grass.

100
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,490
once they remove the debris,

101
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,227
a low-pressure pump moves the water into the treatment plant.

102
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,096
the untreated water, called raw water,

103
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,732
is dirty and smelly.

104
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,704
they first add a powerful form of the chemical element carbon

105
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,372
called activated carbon.

106
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,176
it absorbs contaminants such as solvents and pesticides.

107
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,246
that rids the water of bad taste
and odor.

108
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,514
from there,

109
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,284
the water then goes through a series of mixing tanks.

110
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:40,325
the first tank holds a chemical
called aluminum sulfate.

111
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,126
it acts as a coagulant,

112
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,198
a substance that thickens liquid into globs.

113
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,732
in the raw water,

114
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:52,337
the aluminum sulfate forms tiny,
sticky globs called flocks.

115
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,339
bacteria, mud, and other impurities

116
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,208
stick to those flocks.

117
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,943
then the flock-filled water

118
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,546
moves on to the second mixing tank.

119
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,565
the second tank holds a chemical called polymer,

120
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,635
which is essential to the next step of the process,

121
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,704
called sedimentation.

122
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:29,440
five pipes inject the water with
superfine particles of sand,

123
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,877
called microsand.

124
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,718
the polymer coats the sand, making it sticky.

125
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,988
the grains of sand then stick to the flocks in the raw water,

126
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,790
weighing them down even more.

127
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,260
the water then flows into a settling tank,

128
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,862
where the flocks, because they're heavier,

129
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,063
settle to the bottom.

130
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:56,133
you can see the result in this demonstration.

131
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,804
the water is finally clear, but it's far from drinkable

132
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:03,007
because it's still full of bacteria, viruses,

133
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,343
and other organic matter.

134
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,280
so, on to the next step -- filtration.

135
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,150
the water flows onto the top of the filter

136
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,818
then trickles downward,

137
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,555
passing through a layer of anthracite, a type of coal,

138
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,490
then through a layer of sand.

139
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,494
this filters out any remaining particles,

140
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,295
which then flow to the middle.

141
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,765
but the water is still teeming with bacteria and viruses,

142
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,500
so it has to be disinfected.

143
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,903
they add 1.9 milligrams of chlorine

144
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,638
for every 4 cups of water,

145
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,174
enough to kill off those germs and bugs.

146
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,709
then they add a mineral called silicate

147
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,813
to prevent calcium buildup from blocking our water pipes.

148
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,984
the treatment plant

149
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,653
sends water samples to a government inspector,

150
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,122
who continuously monitors the water supply

151
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,458
to ensure it meets safety standards.

152
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,527
the amount of chlorine remaining in our drinking water

153
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,531
is 20 millionths of an ounce per liter.

154
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:07,539
the chlorine gas the plant uses
is highly toxic.

155
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,340
should any leak out,

156
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,978
emergency teams would have to evacuate a 6-mile radius.

157
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,682
so the plant stores the drums of chlorine

158
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,484
in a high-security area.

159
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,423
it's taken about 45 minutes

160
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,826
to turn raw water into treated water.

161
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,029
now these electric motors

162
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,566
will pump it through underground
pipes, right to your tap.

163
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,712
narrator: short-sightedness, far-sightedness, and astigmatism

164
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,448
are all due to light not focusing precisely

165
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,850
onto the retina.

166
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,518
surgeons can correct this by using a laser

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,856
to reshape the curvature of the front surface of the eye,

168
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,924
called the cornea.

169
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,327
the surgeon operates on one eye at a time.

170
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,665
he cleans the eye, the lid, and
the lashes with antiseptic...

171
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,871
and administers anesthetic drops
to freeze the eye and lid.

172
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,540
he opens the lid wide with a speculum

173
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,542
then rinses the eye with a saline solution.

174
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,346
everything's frozen, so the patient doesn't feel a thing.

175
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,984
next -- antibiotic drops to prevent infection.

176
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,689
before every operation, the surgeon tests the equipment.

177
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,024
he fires the laser on a metal plate

178
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,561
to test its energy level.

179
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,676
the surgeon administers a few more anesthetic drops...

180
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,115
...then inspects the microkeratome,

181
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,984
the device he'll use to lift a very thin layer

182
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,186
from the outer surface of the eye.

183
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,856
he also measures the patient's cornea

184
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,058
using an ultrasonic instrument.

185
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,861
the cornea must be a minimum thickness

186
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,997
for it to be safely reshaped.

187
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,801
the surgeon uses the speculum again to prop the lid open.

188
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,937
then he begins the operation.

189
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,811
he marks the eye with sterile ink,

190
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,347
reference marks he'll use later.

191
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,684
next he positions a metal ring around the cornea.

192
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,353
the ring is attached to a suction pump

193
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,088
so it clings to the eye.

194
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,758
like holding a tomato steady while you slice it,

195
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,029
it holds the eye steady while the surgeon cuts the tissue.

196
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,899
the surgeon lubricates the eye with sterile water

197
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:53,104
then mops up the excess water with a small, absorbent sponge.

198
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,172
then he takes the microkeratome

199
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,776
and slips it into grooves in the metal suction ring.

200
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,714
in a matter of seconds, the device moves across the eye,

201
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,649
cutting open a flap of tissue,

202
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:08,520
the same way a carpenter's plane
shaves a layer of wood.

203
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,797
the surgeon uses a sterile sponge ring

204
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,901
to keep tears from contaminating the cornea.

205
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,976
he folds back the flap of tissue, exposing the cornea.

206
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,522
he mops up the excess liquid...

207
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,260
...then starts up the laser.

208
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,635
meanwhile, a tiny sponge keeps the flap moist.

209
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,204
the laser, an invisible light,

210
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,040
fires in pulses -- 50 pulses per second.

211
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,244
each pulse vaporizes an area of corneal tissue

212
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,178
100 thousandths of an inch thick.

213
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,849
the laser has been computer-programmed beforehand

214
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,119
so it knows exactly how to reshape the cornea

215
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,188
to give most patients 20/20 vision.

216
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,058
in less than a minute, it's done.

217
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,527
the surgeon removes the sponge

218
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,396
and then using those little ink marks he made earlier

219
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,530
as reference points,

220
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,000
folds the flap back to its original position.

221
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:32,937
if the flap isn't precisely where it was before,

222
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,140
the patient will have distorted vision.

223
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,810
using a syringe that flushes the area with sterile water,

224
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,479
the surgeon carefully smoothes the flap

225
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,349
the same way you'd smooth out a tablecloth.

226
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,485
then he removes the sponge ring.

227
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,087
within 45 seconds,

228
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,691
the negative pressure inside the
cornea sucks the flap back on.

229
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,694
the flap literally seals itself.

230
00:14:56,696 --> 00:15:00,431
with a sponge, the surgeon dabs up any excess water.

231
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:04,302
he applies antibiotic drops as a preventive measure

232
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,104
then inspects the microkeratome again

233
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,507
before moving on to the other eye.

234
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,778
he takes the speculum off, tapes the eye closed,

235
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,115
then performs the same operation
on the other eye.

236
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,452
when that's done, the surgeon uses a high-powered microscope

237
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,855
to make sure the flaps are wrinkle-free.

238
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,258
the patient wears protection shields until the next morning

239
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,793
then overnight for a week.

240
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,670
narrator: the best guitars come
from trees about 800 years old,

241
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,272
trees with enough rings in their trucks

242
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,142
to provide wood with a tight and straight grain,

243
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,143
wood flexible enough to vibrate,

244
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,348
yet strong enough to withstand the pull of the guitar strings.

245
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:59,623
the guitar traveled from north africa to europe

246
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,394
with the moors, who invaded spain in the 8th century.

247
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,432
in time, the guitar became the signature instrument

248
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,434
of spanish flamenco music

249
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,638
and the trademark of the singing cowboy.

250
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,640
in the 1930s,

251
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,511
the acoustic guitar debuted as a jazz instrument.

252
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,849
by the 1960s, as the electric guitar took over rock 'n' roll,

253
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:29,320
the acoustic guitar remained a staple of the folk-music scene.

254
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,866
they use spruce or cedar

255
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,603
because those woods are lightweight and vibrate well.

256
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,406
using a 30-ton press that works like a cookie cutter,

257
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,709
they punch out the shape of the guitar.

258
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,012
the size of the sound hole

259
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,348
affects how the guitar will sound --

260
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,683
the larger the hole, the more treble,

261
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,019
the smaller the hole, the more bass.

262
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,691
then they glue on a wood inlay decoration called a rosette.

263
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,497
next they make the sides of the guitar.

264
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:16,234
they first immerse wood pieces in boiling water

265
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,169
for about 15 seconds...

266
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,276
...then place them in a heated press to make the curve.

267
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,317
the press applies heat from both the top and the bottom

268
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,952
for about a minute.

269
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,465
then they connect the two sides

270
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,601
with blocks of wood made of either mahogany or poplar.

271
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,505
one is glued and clamped at the
bottom, the other at the top.

272
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,012
then they glue on and clamp a wooden lining

273
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,217
which will connect the sides to the top and back.

274
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:10,955
those little cuts give it flexibility around the curves.

275
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,823
then with a hand router,

276
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,694
they carefully notch the lining
to receive four wooden braces

277
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,163
to support the back of the guitar.

278
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,101
strategically placed braces help the top of the guitar

279
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,970
withstand the tension of the strings.

280
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,241
they also equalize sound frequencies

281
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:34,111
by controlling vibration differently at different spots.

282
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,048
after a vacuum press makes the bracing adhere evenly,

283
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,717
they glue on the top and bottom.

284
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,992
the body of the guitar is now assembled.

285
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,296
it goes into a press, then a drying rack for several hours.

286
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,870
next they glue on a plastic binding

287
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,906
to protect the guitar's edges.

288
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,678
then comes a fine sanding.

289
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,415
next a machine with a special sensor

290
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,484
measures the precise angle

291
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,285
at which the body and neck of the guitar

292
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,621
will later be attached.

293
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,691
the angle is critical for sound quality.

294
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,362
it drills the holes and sands the pieces accordingly.

295
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,030
next they apply lacquer --

296
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,799
four to eight coats, depending on the finish.

297
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,038
the fingerboard is made of rosewood or ebony.

298
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,543
the metal frets separate the halftones on the musical scale.

299
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,582
an adjustable rod goes inside the neck.

300
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:48,252
this lets the neck adapt to the different tensions

301
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,856
that different types of strings
require.

302
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,358
they glue the fingerboard on the neck...

303
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,831
...then vacuum-press it to make sure it adheres evenly.

304
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,737
next they install the machine heads

305
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,106
on which the strings will be wound.

306
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,686
the rod in the neck slips into a groove on the body.

307
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,757
the neck is then bolted and clamped until the glue dries.

308
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,026
next they glue on the bridge,

309
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:33,231
securing it with temporary screws and a clamp.

310
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,632
then they glue on the headstock nut,

311
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,337
a hard, plastic piece that spaces the strings evenly.

312
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,774
next comes the saddle, then the bridge pins,

313
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,044
which lock the strings in the bridge.

314
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,247
finally they string the guitar using an electric winder.

315
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,582
because of all the glue-drying time,

316
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,052
it takes three weeks to make a guitar.

317
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,056
the wood will become suppler the more the guitar is played,

318
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,860
so as the guitar ages, the better it will sound.

319
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,002
