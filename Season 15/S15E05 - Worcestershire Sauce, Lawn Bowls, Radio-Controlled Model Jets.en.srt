captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,786
narrator: its name can be a bit
of a tongue-twister --     

4
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,722
"wuss-te-shire" sauce, "woos-ter-sheer" sauce,    

5
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,257
"wuss-te-sure" sauce.     

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,726
all those pronunciations are acceptable,        

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,596
as are the endless ways to use this condiment,     

8
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:06,499
from flavoring beef recipes and salad dressings      

9
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:10,803
to joining tomato juice and vodka in a bloody mary.  

10
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,938
in the early 1800s,      

11
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,474
an english nobleman in the county of worcester   

12
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,476
hired two local chemists,   

13
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,211
john lea and william perrins, 

14
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,881
to duplicate a sauce he had  
tasted while traveling in india.

15
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,550
the resulting concoction was unpalatable,        

16
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,819
so they relegated it to the cellar.         

17
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,622
years later, they came across it

18
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:32,558
during a cellar cleanup and gave it another taste.   

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,228
lo and behold, the sauce had matured and was now delicious. 

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,699
they christened their creation "worcestershire sauce"     

21
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,299
and went into business.    

22
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,303
today, more than 170 years later,   

23
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,839
that same company produces that very recipe,   

24
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:50,108
the specifics of which remain a closely-guarded secret.   

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,578
the process begins with onions and garlic     

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,247
pickled in malt vinegar for one to two years.     

27
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,585
inside the pickling barrels, the bulbs slowly liquefy,   

28
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,455
their flavor infusing the liquid.      

29
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,859
other barrels contain anchovies

30
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,229
cured in salt for several months.      

31
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:18,871
additional ingredients include salt, sugar, white vinegar...  

32
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,007
malt vinegar...        

33
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,543
tamarind concentrate...    

34
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,746
molasses...          

35
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:31,684
and a top-secret blend of flavorings and spices.   

36
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,618
starting with the two vinegars,

37
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,355
workers pour the ingredients one at a time         

38
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,157
into gigantic blending tanks. 

39
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,727
there goes the tamarind concentrate.   

40
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:46,265
now the anchovies.       

41
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,782
the ingredient proportions are top secret,        

42
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:09,855
as is the prescribed mixing time
between ingredients.      

43
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,892
now the pickled onions and garlic...         

44
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,337
...sugar and salt...      

45
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,608
and that secret blend of flavorings and spices.   

46
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,878
next, they pump the mixture into maturation tanks.     

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,548
there, over the course of several months,       

48
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,817
the ingredients age and interact with each other, 

49
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,954
undergoing complex changes in their natural chemistry   

50
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,757
which produce the sauce's distinctive flavor.      

51
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,092
agitators rotate intermittently

52
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,495
to keep the ingredients well-blended.         

53
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,764
the sauce then goes through a sieve,   

54
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:53,098
then through a press,     

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,435
followed by another cycle of blending and straining.   

56
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,371
the sauce is a smooth liquid by the time it progresses   

57
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,974
to the next phase -- pasteurization.        

58
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,710
this process heats the sauce to kill off organisms,     

59
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,914
ensuring optimal flavor for at least 18 months.    

60
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,985
the sauce needs no artificial preservatives whatsoever    

61
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,187
because the vinegars it contains

62
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,690
are natural antimicrobial agents.     

63
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,929
the bottling process is entirely automated.     

64
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,631
the factory produces different formats.       

65
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,435
this one is modeled after the original bottle from the 1830s.

66
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,537
the machinery closes each bottle

67
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,608
with a one-piece, plastic flip-top cap.     

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,543
inside, there's a small hole to ensure the sauce      

69
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,213
dispenses at the right flow rate.    

70
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,784
this prevents accidentally pouring too much sauce.    

71
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,698
as each bottle enters the labeling machine,  

72
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,301
an arm descends onto the cap. 

73
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,770
the machine applies glue to a label,          

74
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,638
slaps it on the bottle,    

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,041
then the arm spins the bottle against brushes        

76
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,744
that push the edges of the label flat.       

77
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,581
then, depending on the format they're packaging,       

78
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,784
the equipment groups 6 or 12 bottles together    

79
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,188
and, from underneath, folds a carton around them.  

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,391
then it shrink-wraps the carton,

81
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:28,260
which then joins others on a pallet.          

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,533
the production process and recipe           

83
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,869
have remained essentially the same      

84
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:41,707
since worcestershire sauce was first bottled in 1835.   

85
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:57,156
narrator: lawn bowling is a quiet, civilized game,  

86
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,758
not something you'd expect to be outlawed.  

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
but in 16th-century england,  

88
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,763
henry viii banned lawn bowling among commoners        

89
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,299
because it was a distraction from work.           

90
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,569
it took a couple of centuries before his ban was lifted,   

91
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,339
and the game became completely legit.    

92
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:19,778
in lawn bowling, the path to victory is not straight.  

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,715
the bowl is designed to roll in a curve       

94
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,383
towards the object ball --   

95
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,252
the smaller yellow one called the jack.        

96
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,789
for many years, lawn bowls   
were made of a tropical hardwood

97
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,858
called lignum vitae,      

98
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,194
but as this wood has become increasingly rare, 

99
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,930
manufacturers have turned to melamine.    

100
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,866
and unlike wood, melamine doesn't change shape 

101
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,736
with temperature and humidity fluctuations.   

102
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,072
production begins with melamine granules     

103
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,208
that have been pre-dyed in a variety of colors     

104
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,743
to appeal to individual preferences.   

105
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,681
an employee scoops the granules
into a tub and weighs them.  

106
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:59,218
lawn bowls come in a range   
of sizes to fit different hands,

107
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,688
so the weight varies accordingly.          

108
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,560
he drapes a cloth over the melamine granules   

109
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,963
and holds it in place with pieces of wood.      

110
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:14,033
then it's into a machine called a pre-heater.      

111
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:16,568
it uses high-frequency radio waves          

112
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,770
to melt the plastic into putty.

113
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,508
the cloth absorbs moisture generated in the process.    

114
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,515
all those melamine bits have now
merged into a malleable mass. 

115
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,250
he squeezes it to reshape it a bit      

116
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,387
so it can be inserted into a molding press.     

117
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:40,859
this 150-ton press forces the plastic dough into a hot mold 

118
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,462
to shape it into a lawn bowl. 

119
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,666
this lawn bowl may look round, but it's not a perfect sphere. 

120
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,334
this slightly irregular shape 

121
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,203
will cause it to roll into a curve.     

122
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,938
he marks the size and other information onto it, 

123
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,143
and then it's over to a computerized lathe.    

124
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,346
it spins the lawn bowl while the blade carves it   

125
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:05,617
to perfect that asymmetrical shape.    

126
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:11,090
other tools then etch two rows of half-moons onto the surface.

127
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,793
this engraved pattern makes the lawn bowl easier to grip. 

128
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,564
the next blade slices off the nubs      

129
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,634
used to spin the lawn bowl in the lathe.         

130
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,370
it also smoothes the surface  

131
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:27,572
until all evidence of the nubs disappears.    

132
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,109
this receptacle uses suction power       

133
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,378
to hold the lawn bowl steady  

134
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
while a carousel moves it forward        

135
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,682
to undergo a vigorous polishing.

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,287
the polisher rubs paste onto the surface        

137
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,323
to buff the lawn bowl to an even sheen.       

138
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,927
a robot then turns the lawn bowl upside down   

139
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:53,131
to expose the unpolished side...

140
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,800
then puts it back in the receptacle       

141
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,237
so the polisher can buff this side of the lawn bowl.  

142
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,343
the entire lawn bowl now gleams,

143
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,881
and an unpolished bowl next to it looks dull by comparison.

144
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,618
but there's more polishing to come.            

145
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,888
the next machine spins the lawn
bowl against another polisher. 

146
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,458
this one applies a finer-grade compound to it.        

147
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,430
down the line, lasers move in unison     

148
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,567
to engrave the same emblem onto four bowls.        

149
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,435
it's a scottish thistle,    

150
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,238
one of over 4,000 team insignias available    

151
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,173
in this production facility.  

152
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,110
each lawn bowl then goes for another spin,       

153
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:41,380
and an employee paints over all the detail work.      

154
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,116
he wipes the paint from the surface,        

155
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,654
but it remains in the engravings
to accentuate them.      

156
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,264
some lawn bowls get two-tone paint jobs.    

157
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,267
the worker brushes red paint into a hawk engraving,     

158
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,704
which provides a nice contrast to the yellow detail work.   

159
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,879
then it's over to the testing department,   

160
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:19,017
where they roll each bowl down a chute and check its swerve.  

161
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,821
they also verify that each bowl

162
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,492
lands in approximately the same
spot as the master bowl,    

163
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,494
which means they're all equal 

164
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,964
and they conform to world standards.      

165
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,567
including cooling time between processes,       

166
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,237
it takes about two days to make a lawn bowl.      

167
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,508
but once the work is done, it's all fun and games.    

168
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,590
narrator: radio-controlled model jets  

169
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,326
first flew onto the radar in the 1970s          

170
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,130
and have since evolved into sophisticated flying machines. 

171
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:08,133
many have turbine engines and use real jet fuel.     

172
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,069
they allow people who would otherwise never pilot a jet  

173
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,138
to experience the thrill of flight           

174
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,541
with both feet on the ground. 

175
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:24,049
radio-controlled model jets can
roll and dive like actual jets.

176
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,756
and they can reach speeds of up to 280 miles an hour.  

177
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,392
operating one isn't child's play.      

178
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:35,160
it takes practice and skill  

179
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,629
to pilot this kind of model aircraft.       

180
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,369
it also takes money      
because they cost up to $20,000.

181
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,446
making a model jet begins with the paint job.   

182
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,448
they airbrush designs directly into the molds    

183
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,318
that will be used to shape various parts.    

184
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,653
this particular mold will be used          

185
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,922
to make one half of a wing shell.        

186
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:12,197
when the paint dries, they roll
epoxy resin into the mold...  

187
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,501
...then put down a layer of fiberglass.         

188
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,809
they reinforce the fiberglass with superstrong carbon fiber, 

189
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,212
then brush on more epoxy resin.

190
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,147
the next layer is balsa,    

191
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,951
a lightweight wood from south america.      

192
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,689
they apply carbon fiber to sections of the wing    

193
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,891
where parts are to be attached.

194
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:45,764
another sheet of fiberglass, and epoxy is the final layer. 

195
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,433
now they add a layer of absorbent material,     

196
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,171
then sandwich the mold in plastic film.        

197
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:57,075
they install a connector for a vacuum hose and hook it up. 

198
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:06,051
the vacuum pulls out the air, squeezing the layers together. 

199
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,588
then they bake the unit, which activates the epoxy,   

200
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,989
fusing the materials together. 

201
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:16,928
next, they assemble the wooden framework for the wings.    

202
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,065
they reinforce it with strips of carbon fiber  

203
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,101
and apply epoxy on the edges. 

204
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,673
the model makers carefully install the framework     

205
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,476
on the wing shell.       

206
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,013
they apply an extra rib along the wing tip...     

207
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,818
...slide aluminum cylinders into tubes in the framework,  

208
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,890
then bead more epoxy along the wing shell's perimeter.  

209
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,560
they use high-strength adhesive

210
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,495
in strategic parts of the framework        

211
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,699
to attach the other half of the molded wing.      

212
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,571
they bolt the molds together  

213
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,908
and set the assembly aside to allow the epoxy to cure.  

214
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,710
after a few hours, they extract the wing,     

215
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,712
its artwork nicely transferred 

216
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,182
from the inside surface of the mold.          

217
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,717
machinery then cuts holes in the wing          

218
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:17,656
for installing landing gear and motors called servos.   

219
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:20,591
this router is computer programmed     

220
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,795
to make perfect cuts without  
damaging the internal framework.

221
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,665
this is critical because just a fraction of an inch off,

222
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,503
and the router would destroy the carefully crafted wing.   

223
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,878
the modeler now perforates the fiberglass layer of the wing.  

224
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,215
he's creating a hinged section called an aileron.       

225
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:47,486
it's a control surface that will
cause the plane to turn or roll.

226
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,426
the ailerons and other control surfaces   

227
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,295
will be powered by servomotors.

228
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,836
the front fuselage shell has been molded        

229
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,239
and is now ready to be revealed.

230
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,248
like the wings, the body of this model jet   

231
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,183
needs a supporting framework  

232
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:22,654
along with brackets for attachments.        

233
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,389
another computerized router  

234
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,893
carves them out of multilayered
carbon-fiber board.      

235
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:35,200
the modeler glues these parts inside the fuselage      

236
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,136
and the tail of the jet.    

237
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,938
coming up next,        

238
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,009
this model jet gets its wings and prepares for takeoff.   

239
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,894
narrator: controlling one of these jets is challenging  

240
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,030
and requires concentration.  

241
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,500
these are expensive toys,   
and the learning curve is steep.

242
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:09,834
one bad landing,        

243
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,838
and this model jet could end up
in a crumpled heap.      

244
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,907
it's why flyers hone their skills at airfields   

245
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,877
and test them in international competitions. 

246
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,715
back at the factory,      

247
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:27,786
the molded pieces of this model jet are coming together. 

248
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,655
they attach the wings to the fuselage        

249
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,458
using the cylinders installed earlier.       

250
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,394
then the modeler moves to the aircraft's tail  

251
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,797
and attaches the stabilizers...

252
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,000
the rudder...         

253
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,670
and the vertical fin.     

254
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,207
super-strength glue cements the assembly.     

255
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,677
next, they build the motor.  

256
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,614
this one is a ducted-fan electric system,        

257
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,082
a type used in smaller jets.  

258
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,618
the modeler first assembles the casing           

259
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,088
that will hold the fan and its motor.         

260
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,423
he slides airfoils into the casing        

261
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,824
to create four ducts,     

262
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:10,695
which will properly channel the flow of air.        

263
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,499
he slides the electric motor into the aluminum hub...    

264
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,038
...then anchors the assembly  

265
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,207
with a screw from the other side.      

266
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:28,379
the next part is a speed-control mechanism. 

267
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,083
he solders its wires to those protruding from the motor.   

268
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,522
he encloses the mechanism in a vented tube,       

269
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:42,226
then sets the assembly aside temporarily.          

270
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,729
now focus turns to the fan,  

271
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,465
which he hooks up to a testing device.      

272
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,733
as the fan spins,       

273
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,202
the machine analyzes it for vibrations         

274
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:54,439
that would indicate the blades are out of balance.      

275
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,141
the gauge shows it's vibrating slightly,    

276
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,678
so he makes adjustments, and then it's ready to install.

277
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,214
he attaches the fan to the motor shaft       

278
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,984
and secures it with a bolt in the center.         

279
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,090
it's now time to power up this motor at a test station. 

280
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,425
[ whirring ]          

281
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,696
[ whirring intensifies ]    

282
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,831
he brings it up to full throttle

283
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,901
and measures the thrust it generates.         

284
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,772
it passes the test,      

285
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,709
so he installs it in the model jet's fuselage.  

286
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,511
later, this ducted fan motor  

287
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,781
will be connected to a battery pack.       

288
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,250
now he moves on to the landing gear      

289
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,787
and attaches air cylinders to the front and rear wheels. 

290
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,723
pumping air into these cylinders

291
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:47,859
will cause the wheels to retract
after takeoff.         

292
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:55,500
this system will also cause the
wheels to engage for landing. 

293
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:03,140
next, a sheet of clear thermoplastic is transformed  

294
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,644
into cockpit-canopy parts.   

295
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,814
a machine heats the plastic,  

296
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,684
then vacuum-shrinks it to two molds.         

297
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,620
the plastic hardens in seconds 

298
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,957
to create two clear plastic bubbles for the jet canopy.  

299
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,229
they mold the cockpit shell in two sections        

300
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,364
using the same technique.   

301
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:40,111
with the cockpit now installed and a doll for a pilot,    

302
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:44,582
this '50s-era korean war jet replica is in fighting form.  

303
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:48,853
all that's left is to install the radio-control system,   

304
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,656
which will be done by the operator after purchase.

305
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:57,529
from nose to tail, the attention
to detail<i> is</i> impressive.    

306
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,332
some of these model jets even have gas-turbine engines 

307
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,269
for added authenticity.    

308
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,605
with radio controls installed, 

309
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:11,876
this turbine model jet is ready
to taxi down the runway.    

310
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,947
the operator does one last check
of the control surfaces,    

311
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,383
then it's time for takeoff.  

312
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,556
miniature turbine engines   

313
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,827
sound and work like those of a big jet.         

314
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,895
these jets rumble and soar   

315
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,766
and can be made to perform many aerobatic stunts.     

316
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:38,770
of course, it all hinges on both
the skill of the operator   

317
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:41,773
and a job well done at the factory.        

318
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,413
but this looks like another successful landing.  

319
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,995
if you have any comments about the show,
