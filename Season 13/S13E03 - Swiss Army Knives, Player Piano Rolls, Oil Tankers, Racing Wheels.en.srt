narrator: the swiss army knife      

4
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,789
is an entire tool kit in a pocket-sized package.   

5
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,325
this little multitool actually dates back to 1891  

6
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,461
with the original swiss soldier's knife.     

7
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,197
it wasn't long before it morphed into other versions 

8
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
for sale to the general public,

9
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,903
and a century later, it continues to come in handy. 

10
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,408
lost in the wilderness,    

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,345
or are you a serious multitasker?          

12
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:23,816
either way, a swiss army knife has tools to help you cope.  

13
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:27,219
production starts with this big coil of stainless steel.  

14
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:32,291
equipment pulls the steel between a press and a die.   

15
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,226
the press forces the steel against the die        

16
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,162
to punch out blade shapes.   

17
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,829
it also forms the finger groove

18
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,799
for pulling the blade out of the handle.       

19
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,507
they mass-produce parts like can openers and pliers  

20
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,643
using the same technique.   

21
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:51,978
they load the blades      

22
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,047
into a vibrating mix of ceramic stones and water.  

23
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,116
the friction polishes the steel.

24
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,854
a little powder keeps the parts
from sticking together.    

25
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,658
after several hours, they activate a powerful magnet

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,862
to extract the parts from the vibrating mass.    

27
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,865
the process has smoothed the blades significantly.   

28
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,600
but the metal is weak and dull.

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,937
so a worker arranges the blades
on a mesh conveyor       

30
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:23,142
which goes into an oven that exposes them to intense heat. 

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,413
a quick cooldown follows,   

32
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:30,883
which toughens the steel considerably.         

33
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,351
the hardened blades now ride a carousel      

34
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,356
into a grinding station, which slims and trims them.  

35
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,357
that green liquid keeps them cool        

36
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,293
during this process.      

37
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,496
afterwards, a computerized tool
measures the blades.      

38
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,166
if the dimensions are even slightly off,     

39
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,768
they won't fit into the knife handle.     

40
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,573
a quick stamp gives the part its trademark name.      

41
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,383
to build the swiss army knife, 

42
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,919
they slide everything onto brass rivets,       

43
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,987
beginning with an aluminum spacer.      

44
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:11,056
a flat metal spring goes on next,         

45
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:14,060
followed by a can opener, a screwdriver,         

46
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:18,597
and an awl, a punch to make holes in leather.   

47
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,535
they stack another spacer and spring on top.       

48
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,935
they tamp it down       

49
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,471
and then slide a multipurpose hook and a pair of scissors  

50
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,742
onto the rivets.        

51
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:33,612
another divider, another spring.

52
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:37,149
and then they add a wood saw to this multitool sandwich,   

53
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,686
because you never know when you might need one.    

54
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,290
they press-fit the main blade, a corkscrew,          

55
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,626
and a smaller blade onto the assembly.       

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,365
one final spacer, and then they secure the rivets

57
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,435
with attachments called bushings.        

58
00:03:56,437 --> 00:04:00,306
incredibly, they've packed nine tools into a bundle    

59
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,775
that's just under an inch thick.

60
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,577
they chop off the tops of the rivets     

61
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,445
to make them flush with the bushings,       

62
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,517
and then this spinning tool flattens them.         

63
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,586
the result is a multipronged tool     

64
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:18,124
that's virtually impossible to pull apart.         

65
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:20,459
the blade on the swiss army knife is thin    

66
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,794
compared to other pocket knives

67
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,597
to allow it to fit into the casing.    

68
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,865
they grind the cutting edge  

69
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,734
to angle it at just under 15 degrees.   

70
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,435
this makes it razor-sharp,   

71
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,671
ensuring there won't be many dull moments       

72
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,141
in this blade's lifetime.   

73
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:41,146
they measure the angled edge with a laser          

74
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,616
to verify that it's on the mark.

75
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,486
and now it's time for the handle.        

76
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,221
it comes in two parts.     

77
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,624
they sandwich the tool bundle between them          

78
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,693
and press everything together. 

79
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,296
this embeds the bushings in the handle's holes     

80
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,665
for a tight installation.   

81
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:06,906
amazingly, there's still space in this swiss army knife    

82
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:09,608
for a set of tweezers and a toothpick.        

83
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,916
finally, they inspect every tool

84
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,319
to confirm that it's in perfect condition 

85
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,656
and that it springs out of the handle as it's designed to.

86
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,257
making a swiss army knife   

87
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,594
is a job performed with almost military precision.

88
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:29,929
there's no room for error   

89
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,397
when it comes to packing all these tools        

90
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,599
into a pocket-sized unit.   

91
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,935
and once they do,       

92
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:40,206
this multitool is ready to spring into action.     

93
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,089
narrator: the first self-playing piano system   

94
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,025
was invented around 1895.   

95
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,094
it sat in front of a regular piano,      

96
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,964
and the machine's wooden fingers
would play the keys.      

97
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:08,033
guiding those fingers was a roll of perforated paper.

98
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,702
by the early 20th century,   

99
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,037
piano companies incorporated the roll mechanism       

100
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,673
right into the piano itself.  

101
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:25,918
the player-piano rage petered out around 1930,    

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,121
but there are still plenty of old player pianos around,  

103
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,791
so there remains a market for the music rolls they play. 

104
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:37,129
the original roll-making method
used a recording piano.    

105
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,398
[ piano music playing ]    

106
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,002
as the musician played,    

107
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:44,870
each key would trigger a pneumatic valve       

108
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,206
which pressed the corresponding rod     

109
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,474
against piano roll paper over carbon paper.       

110
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:54,880
then they just perforate the carbon marks.       

111
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,015
the modern method uses an electronic keyboard  

112
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:00,418
and a computer.        

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,755
as the musician plays,     

114
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,857
the computer converts the notes to data.  

115
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,497
the musician edits the data,  

116
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,098
then loads it into a computer 

117
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,234
that's hooked up to the roll perforator,    

118
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:20,438
a machine that produces 18 rolls simultaneously.    

119
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,307
like the old recording machine,

120
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,910
the roll perforator has a pneumatic valve     

121
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,579
for each note of the piano keyboard.     

122
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,314
as the computer activates each note,      

123
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,850
the corresponding valve triggers a steel punch     

124
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,320
to descend and pierce a hole in the passing paper.     

125
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:39,391
the longer the hole, the longer the note.      

126
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,793
most music consists of multi-note chords,     

127
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,063
so the machine vibrates like crazy,          

128
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,565
punching many notes simultaneously.        

129
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,873
when the machine finishes perforating,     

130
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,742
the operator cuts off the paper

131
00:07:56,744 --> 00:08:00,145
and sticks on a temporary label
bearing the song title.    

132
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,815
the paper then moves on to another area,       

133
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:07,419
where they permanently stamp on 
the title and other information.

134
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,530
here, they slice the front end of the paper into a point.   

135
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,906
meanwhile, this machine rivets brass eyelets      

136
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,844
onto an adhesive-backed polyethylene strip.      

137
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:39,717
then around each eyelet, a die stamps out a tab.     

138
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,455
they stick one eyelet tab   
to the pointed tip of each roll.

139
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,723
this tab end, as it's called, 

140
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,193
hooks into the mechanism of the player piano.      

141
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,597
a touch of cornstarch over any exposed adhesive   

142
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:55,601
prevents the papers from sticking to one another. 

143
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,469
when the music has lyrics,   

144
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,671
they print the words right on the rolls       

145
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,273
so you can sing along as the piano plays.      

146
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,277
the first step is to make a lyric stencil,  

147
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,481
which requires cranking out each word, letter by letter.  

148
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,684
the placement of words on the stencil is tricky    

149
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,220
because they have to synchronize
with the notes.        

150
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,755
the stencil goes into a printer

151
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,793
which applies the lyrics with an ink roller.      

152
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,834
the last step is to roll up the rolls.    

153
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,503
they wind each one around a cardboard spool    

154
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,439
that has a plastic flange on each end.          

155
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,109
when you load a roll into the piano,        

156
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,977
you mount its flanges on holders,          

157
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,180
then hook the tab end to a spool           

158
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,849
that pulls the roll through the player mechanism. 

159
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,788
a rubber band to keep the roll from unraveling --       

160
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,392
then it's into a custom box.  

161
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,327
a machine shapes and hot-glues 

162
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,898
sheets of ornately printed cardboard into the box tops.  

163
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,614
the finishing touch is a sticker          

164
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,549
with the title of the music.  

165
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,885
when a roll moves through a player piano, 

166
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,154
air flows through the perforations,   

167
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,490
triggering the corresponding pneumatic valves.       

168
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,129
each valve pushes down the corresponding note.    

169
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,369
this factory produces more than
4,500 different song titles  

170
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,371
on player-piano rolls,     

171
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,375
from classic favorites to top-10 hits.        

172
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,660
narrator: the first oil tanker was launched by the british  

173
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,729
in the latter part of the 19th century,      

174
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:06,865
and it fueled a revolution in transportation.       

175
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:10,269
these enormous ships      
now dominate the world's oceans.

176
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,337
they move millions of tons of oil daily.         

177
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,605
and without them,       

178
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,209
most of the world's economies would be powerless.      

179
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
the life-size version of this tanker ship      

180
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,284
will be bigger than two football fields.   

181
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,354
it's so big that they build it 
in sections called grand blocks,

182
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:33,358
which they assemble by crane in a dry dock.         

183
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:41,833
the process takes plenty of planning and engineering.  

184
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,303
they map out the job on a computer         

185
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:48,507
and assign a number to each of the 110,000 parts. 

186
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:49,908
in a big job like this,    

187
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,979
computer-coordinated labeling is the only way to go.     

188
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,715
they weld steel sheets to build the ship's hull.   

189
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,586
sand, placed on the seam, melts during the welding    

190
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:05,857
to shield the seam from any contaminants in the air.  

191
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,527
workers ready the structural steel beams.  

192
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,330
a robot places them at just the right spot     

193
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:16,001
on the welded section of the hull.          

194
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,605
then an operator verifies that the placement is correct. 

195
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,811
more robots weld the beams to the hull section.      

196
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:30,081
next, they submerge a steel plate in water.    

197
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,618
the water suppresses the noise and smoke from a plasma cutter 

198
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,220
as it carves holes in the steel.

199
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,424
this steel plate will be part of the ballast tank.      

200
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,361
some of the holes will allow water to flow through     

201
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:46,898
while others lighten up the steel structure.      

202
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,434
the superheated plasma also cuts slits        

203
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:54,238
to interlock with the structural
beams on the hull part.    

204
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,374
they then weld the assembly  

205
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,310
and install a top plate for a double-layered hull.   

206
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:04,216
double hulls provide extra   
protection against oil spillage.

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,054
after a paint job,       

208
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,591
powerful machinery transfers the double-hull grand block   

209
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,993
to its final position on the side of the tanker.   

210
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,330
when fully assembled,     

211
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,931
the hull will have 12 cargo tanks    

212
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,536
with a total capacity of 14 million gallons.     

213
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,008
the engine section is situated at the stern of the tanker.  

214
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,344
it will take three diesel generators    

215
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,879
to power the ship's lighting, ventilation,          

216
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,548
and computer systems.     

217
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,285
they carefully lower each one onto the deck of the ship.   

218
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,089
a 10,000-horsepower diesel engine         

219
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,025
will be the tanker's driving force.         

220
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,895
installing it is a very precise business.  

221
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,098
it has to be in just the right position   

222
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,767
to turn the massive propeller. 

223
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,636
four months later, the hull is complete      

224
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,541
and the massive propeller is in position.        

225
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,380
it's all hands on deck to build the deckhouse,    

226
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:13,185
where a crew will live for months at a time.      

227
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:17,722
there will be an incredible  
10 miles of piping on this ship.

228
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:22,260
here, workers weld and bolt them
to the deck grand blocks.   

229
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:26,731
it's an elaborate maze with an impressive master plan.

230
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,201
they connect these pipes to the series of tanks in the hull

231
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,172
so they can be used to load and unload cargo.   

232
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,012
meanwhile, inside the hull,  

233
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,948
those cargo tanks are coming together.      

234
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,484
on the very bottom,      

235
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,352
the crew builds a network of heating coils.       

236
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,754
they'll be used to heat crude oil       

237
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,222
to a more fluid form      

238
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,393
so it can be pumped out of the tanks.       

239
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,567
other workers grind welded seams
on the ship's outer skin.   

240
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,438
this evens the surface for painting.         

241
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,373
the paint is an epoxy blend  

242
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,109
that resists corrosion in salt water.         

243
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,178
they apply it in three or four layers    

244
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,717
and measure its thickness   
with a special ultrasonic gauge.

245
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,853
in total, they spray more than 38,000 gallons of paint  

246
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,289
on this tanker.        

247
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,726
in this time-lapse video,   

248
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,530
our tanker comes together like toy building blocks    

249
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,598
in a matter of seconds.    

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,068
but as you've just learned, this is a complex job.     

251
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,137
it actually takes 16 months.  

252
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,940
a couple more months of testing,

253
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,311
and this tanker should be good for the long haul.       

254
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,828
narrator: at first glance,   

255
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,298
a racing wheel doesn't look much
different than a standard wheel.

256
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,766
but look a little closer.   

257
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,500
there are subtle differences  

258
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,169
in the angles and contours that set it apart.       

259
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,638
they give it the strength   

260
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,907
to handle the extreme forces of racing           

261
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,042
and to corner well at high speed,         

262
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,445
which should have them cheering
in the stands.         

263
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,986
the driver will get the trophy and the credit,        

264
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,856
but a good set of wheels is behind every win.      

265
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,191
they start with high-strength, low-alloy steel,        

266
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,794
which is a very stable material.

267
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,930
the first of a series of die presses   

268
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,466
gives the center disc a concave profile       

269
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,669
and forms lug holes.      

270
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,405
the next press punches a hole for the hub          

271
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,541
and others called windows.   

272
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,476
windows help cool the brakes  

273
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,212
while maintaining strength where needed.         

274
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,751
they stamp rings around the windows.      

275
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,219
this is called coining.    

276
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,688
the rings give the windows a nicer look,         

277
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,490
and the action compresses the steel      

278
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,926
to further strengthen the part.

279
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,498
the next press is critical.  

280
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,834
it forces the disc into a bowl shape        

281
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:19,370
and gives it precise dimensions
to accommodate brakes.     

282
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:24,442
the specific angles also reinforce the part.    

283
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,112
it has taken a lot of punching and pressing,   

284
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,046
but the center disc of this racing wheel      

285
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,916
has really taken shape.    

286
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,123
a smaller press now punches out the lug holes 

287
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,924
that were outlined earlier.  

288
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:43,328
these holes will allow the wheel
to be mounted to a vehicle.  

289
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,936
then the center disc goes for a spin        

290
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,339
as a series of tools trim it. 

291
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,742
the part is now complete.   

292
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:02,080
to make the rim, a machine unwinds coiled steel,

293
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,749
and rollers iron out the curl. 

294
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,751
a mechanical arm maintains slack

295
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,154
as the flattened steel goes under the knife.      

296
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,290
the blade, called a shearer,  

297
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,758
cuts the steel to length    

298
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,228
and stamps product information onto it in one swoop.     

299
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,968
an operator now winds the steel
between three rollers     

300
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,838
to twist it into a band.    

301
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,441
he then places the band into the jaws of a welder,   

302
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,243
which fuses the two ends together.     

303
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,720
he then slides the band into a machine         

304
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:46,590
that scrapes off excess material
from the well.         

305
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,795
it's still warm, so it can be easily removed.  

306
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,132
now the band comes under some serious pressure     

307
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,135
as a machine forces it around dies at both ends    

308
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,703
to create flares.       

309
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,811
this rack transfers the rim to a series of rollers     

310
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,481
which shape its inner ledge.  

311
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,483
this part of the rim is called the bead seed,    

312
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,520
and it will be attached to the bead wall of the tire. 

313
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,629
they trim the rim to make the edges neater.   

314
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,967
this finishes off the part.  

315
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,970
they nestled the center disc loosely in the rim.      

316
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:36,174
as the rim spins, they heat the outside with a torch.   

317
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,510
this causes the steel to expand,

318
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:43,114
and the center disc drops further into the rim.  

319
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,387
as the rim cools, it contracts,
shrinking to the center part. 

320
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,923
the two parts are now interconnected,    

321
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,827
and a welding job makes the bond permanent.   

322
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,006
a worker drills threaded holes onto the wheel 

323
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,341
to attach valve stems.     

324
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,678
as it exits, the drill turns in reverse   

325
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,981
so it doesn't wreck the threads.

326
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,487
after a fresh coat of paint,  

327
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,824
they apply a thread-locking adhesive to the valve stems  

328
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:28,460
and screw them into the holes. 

329
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,965
the valves will be used to add air to the tires.    

330
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,569
the wheel rotates as a small roller       

331
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,239
paints a stripe onto the rim for accent.          

332
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,774
then a press stamps a number onto it        

333
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:48,046
to identify this wheel in the event of a problem.   

334
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:52,717
and now this wheel is on    
a fast track to the finish line.

335
