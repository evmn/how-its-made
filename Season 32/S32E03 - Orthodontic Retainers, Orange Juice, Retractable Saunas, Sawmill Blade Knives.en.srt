when it comes to sustainability,        

300
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,191
this is a new kind of cutting edge.        

301
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,330
what was once an old sawmill blade is now a sleek, 

302
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,265
new brush-cutting knife --   

303
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,600
proof that the future doesn't have to be dull    

304
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,369
for discarded mill blades.          

305
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,008
a sawmill blade lasts 5 to 10 years.      

306
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,277
but when it jagged edges wear thin,           

307
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,546
it can't cut logs anymore.   

308
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:58,349
luckily, the carbon steel can be salvaged.        

309
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,886
a computerized high-pressure water tool    

310
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:04,222
cuts into a stack of three sawmill blades.    

311
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:09,227
in doing so, it carves out numerous knife blade blanks.  

312
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,831
the computerized tool also cuts
holes for the handles     

313
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,100
and a tab for attaching the knife sheath.

314
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:21,239
next, the blades are transferred
to a vibratory tumbler.    

315
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,709
the tumbler is filled with triangular ceramic stones 

316
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,245
and a soapy solution.     

317
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,781
for several hours, the vibrating stones      

318
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,516
smooth and clean the blades.          

319
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,055
once complete, a technician secures the blades

320
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,823
in a fixture with screws.          

321
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,528
the screws hold the blades down flat,           

322
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,465
and lock them in position for the next step.       

323
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,735
this tool's spiral bit carves into the steel     

324
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:55,140
to shave small amounts from around the edges.     

325
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,475
this improves the shape of the knife     

326
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,277
and ensures that the knife handle     

327
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,746
will fit perfectly on the tang.          

328
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,082
the trimming also removes the lines       

329
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,750
left by the water-jet cutting.     

330
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,622
one of the blades is placed in a fixture          

331
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,823
that holds the knife      

332
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,092
with the cutting edge in an upward position.     

333
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,497
a technician ignites an automated torch.      

334
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:24,168
the torch follows the blade, exposing it to intense heat.  

335
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,705
the torch doesn't touch the blade's spine.       

336
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,775
this selective heat treatment hardens only the blade.    

337
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,212
♪          

338
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:42,120
an operator places the blade into a bucket of quenching oil.

339
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,056
this rapid cooldown      
completes the hardening process.

♪          

341
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,595
next, the cutting edge is beveled,          

342
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,499
and the entire blade is coated with a thermoplastic polymer, 

343
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,636
which provides a hard finish and prevents rust.       

344
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:04,109
then, the knives are transferred
to a laser-emblazoning chamber.

345
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,947
another technician closes the chamber doors    

346
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:11,616
and activates the laser.    

347
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,919
the computerized laser etches the company logo,    

348

the knives' model number,   

349
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,290
and other information into the steel.        

350
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,093
at the next station, a technician moves a blade   

351
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,628
against and abrasive belt   

352
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,899
held in by a special fixture along a track.         

353
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,168
this angles the blade precisely to the abrasive belt 

354
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,005
to grind the cutting edge and complete the bevel.    

355
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:40,412
this brush-cutting blade is now almost razor-sharp.   

356
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,782
he sharpens the tip of the knife      

357
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,952
by gentling pressing it against another abrasive belt. 

358
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,927
next, he applies an abrasive compound to a buffing wheel.  

359
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,800
he presses the cutting edge of the knife against the wheel,

360
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,535
and the abrasive compound works its magic,        

361
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,272
honing the edge to its final sharpness.    

362
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:14,746
he presses threaded fittings into the tang of the knife.  

363
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,081
he installs them so that the fittings protrude 

364
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,949
from both sides of the tang.

♪          

366

the fittings in the tang have been spaced        

367
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,491
to match holes in a handle.          

368
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,028
this handle is made of composite glass and resin.   

369
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,466
there are two parts, one for each side of the tang. 

370
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,903
due to the precision prep work,    

371
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,873
the two parts fit together perfectly as one.

screws hold the handle parts together.

he dips the tips in a thread-lock solution.

when the thread-lock solution cures,

it's taken several hours

to transform a blunt sawmill blade     

380
