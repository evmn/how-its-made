00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,124
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,227
          ...cement...          

5
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,565
          ...caskets...         

6
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,505
        ...soft drinks...       

7
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,877
     ...and glider rockers.     

8
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,055
  many people confuse the terms 
    "cement" and "concrete."    

9
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,591
  cement is a fine, gray powder 
  that's used to make concrete. 

10
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,061
     it's also an ingredient    
          in the mortar         

11
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,329
         that masons use        
     to lay brick and stone.    

12
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,798
        cement also goes        
        into soil cement,       

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,402
     a material that's used     
 in paving roads, building dams,

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,137
     and lining reservoirs.     

15
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,410
        the action begins       
    at the limestone quarry.    

16
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,211
 the limestone near the surface 

17
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,948
       has a high content       
     of the minerals silica,    

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,083
    iron, and aluminum oxide.   

19
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,552
          deeper down,          
   the limestone is more pure,  

20
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,354
         containing less        
        of those minerals       

21
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,490
   and more calcium carbonate.  

22
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,625
            the plant           
    uses both types of rock,    

23
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:37,229
  altering their proportions to 
 make different types of cement.

24
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,430
       workers drill holes      
        in the rock wall,       

25
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,699
      in which they plant       
      powerful explosives.      

26
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,503
     for safety, the workers    
   have to position themselves  

27
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,237
         behind the area        
        they're blasting,       

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,709
     maintaining a distance     
     of at least 150 feet.      

29
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,954
      after the explosion,      
        loaders move in.        

30
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,923
          they transfer         
       the limestone rocks      

31
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,325
 to 50-ton-capacity dump trucks.

32
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,896
the trucks then haul their cargo
   to the cement plant nearby.  

33
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,949
          at the plant,         
    the trucks dump the rocks   

34
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,418
       into what's called       
      the primary crusher.      

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,355
            the rocks           
    can be as big as a piano.   

36
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:41,159
the primary crusher reduces them
to about the size of softballs. 

37
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,694
    there's a constant spray    
            of water            

38
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,696
        to keep the dust        
        from billowing up       

39
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,832
   and settling on the chutes.  

40
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,313
           from there,          

41
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,182
 a conveyor transports the rocks
    to the secondary crusher.   

42
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,586
     it reduces them further    
to about the size of golf balls.

43
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,521
 rock high in calcium carbonate 

44
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,923
          and rock low          
      in calcium carbonate      

45
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,358
     are crushed separately.    

46
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,861
  now it's time to mix the two. 

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,063
        the ratio varies        

48
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,866
 according to the type of cement
         they're making.        

49
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,201
     this overhead machine,     
        called a tripper,       

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,470
           makes piles          
  of the required proportions.  

51
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,739
   they call this the raw mix.  

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,476
     then a reclaimer loads     
           the raw mix          

53
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,680
     into a grinding machine    
      called a roller mill.     

54
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,281
   depending on what minerals   

55
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,883
      are already naturally     
      in the crushed rock,      

56
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,886
        the factory adds        
         extra minerals         

57
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,490
    such as silica and iron.    

58
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:49,094
     certain types of cement    
  also require aluminum oxide.  

59
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,297
   the roller mixes and grinds  
   the ingredients uniformly,   

60
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,434
   producing a dry rock powder  
      called the raw meal.      

61
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,769
         now the powder         
     goes into a preheater.     

62
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,639
  the temperature of the powder 
    is 180 degrees fahrenheit   

63
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,974
         upon entering.         

64
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,576
   within 40 seconds, it gets   
   more that 10 times hotter.   

65
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,713
     this begins the process    
of binding the minerals together

66
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,782
  so that they'll later harden  
    when hydrated with water.   

67
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,785
 the preheater is equipped with 
 what's called a flash calciner.

68
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,923
 in about 5 seconds, it removes 
    95% of the carbon dioxide   

69
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,126
          in the powder         
  through a chemical reaction.  

70
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,527
     this isolates the lime,    

71
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,196
        which is the most       
  important element in cement.  

72
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,866
     from there, the powder     
    moves into a rotary kiln,   

73
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,068
  a huge, cylindrical furnace.  

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,138
it's set on an angle so that the
powder moves from top to bottom,

75
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,407
     a distance of 160 feet.    

76
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,676
        the kiln rotates        
     about 2 turns a minute     

77
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,211
 to ensure the materials travel 
   through at the right speed.  

78
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,946
     the burner's gas flame     
          at the bottom         

79
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,750
    reaches a scorching 2,900   
  to 3,000 degrees fahrenheit.  

80
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,554
  as the powder approaching it  
 reaches the 1,500-degree mark, 

81
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,691
      it fuses into pieces      
   about the size of marbles.   

82
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,760
these pieces are called clinker.

83
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,897
 as the clinker leaves the kiln,
     large fans cool it down    

84
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,502
         to between 140         
   and 180 degrees fahrenheit.  

85
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,970
         it's important         
   to cool the clinker quickly  

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,706
in order to have quality cement.

87
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,645
     from here, the clinker     
    goes to the storage area.   

88
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,788
 the last stage of cement making
   is called finish grinding.   

89
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,857
      they add some gypsum      
         to the clinker.        

90
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,526
    the precise amount varies   

91
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,728
     with the type of cement    
         they're making.        

92
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,730
          gypsum delays         
   the cement's setting time,   

93
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,266
   so it can be worked for up   
 to two hours before hardening. 

94
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,535
        the cement mills        
      are called ball mills     

95
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,537
      because they contain      
          metal balls,          

96
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,807
     about 150 tons of them,    
      in the largest mill.      

97
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,209
      as the mill rotates,      

98
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,945
    the balls crush and grind   
     the clinker and gypsum     

99
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,547
       into a fine powder.      

100
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,893
            narrator:           
 the terms "casket" and "coffin"
 are often used interchangeably,

101
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,630
     but there are distinct     
  differences between the two.  

102
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,700
      coffins are actually      
 those eight-sided burial boxes 

103
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,037
      that are narrower at      
the bottom -- think "dracula" --

104
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,505
whereas caskets are rectangular.

105
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,576
        they can be made        
   of metal, plastic, or wood.  

106
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,716
  whether the wood is ash, oak, 
  mahogany, or something else,  

107
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,585
    the casket's construction   
     is generally the same.     

108
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,521
    first they run wood slats   

109
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,589
        through a machine       
        called a molder.        

110
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,991
    this profiles the edges,    

111
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,260
  carving a tongue on one side  
          of each slat          

112
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,262
   and a groove on the other.   

113
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,330
      a worker applies glue     
         to these edges,        

114
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,732
    then positions the slats    
        in a rounded vise       

115
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,469
     that locks the tongues     
     and grooves together.      

116
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,806
         the glue dries         
     in an hour and a half,     

117
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:51,676
  bonding the slats permanently 
   into a large, curved piece.  

118
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,145
  this piece will form the top  
         and long sides         

119
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,081
         of the casket's        
       rectangular cover.       

120
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,772
   to complete the rectangle,   

121
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,575
       a worker now makes       
   a v-shaped cut on each side  

122
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,311
 and glues in a triangular piece
        of slatted wood.        

123
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,983
      while a press clamps      
the components tightly together,

124
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,986
    he secures the end pieces   
 in place with joint fasteners, 

125
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,989
         which are like         
       heavy-duty staples.      

126
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,593
  now a machine carves a groove 
   into the cover's underside   

127
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,528
        at the midpoint.        

128
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,463
        a worker glues in       
         a wooden piece,        

129
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,332
           securing it          
      with joint fasteners.     

130
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,601
this piece is called the bridge,

131
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,135
       and it's the point       
       at which the cover       

132
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,872
  will be cut in half later on. 

133
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,608
 they transfer the casket cover 
     to an automated machine    

134
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,612
 that gives it a rough sanding, 
      then a finer sanding.     

135
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:04,282
   the next step is to attach   
      a decorative molding      

136
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,084
to the base of the casket cover.

137
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,487
    this molding has a groove   
          on the inside         

138
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,888
    into which they'll later    
          tuck the edge         

139
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,091
         of the casket's        
       upholstery fabric.       

140
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,026
  a worker glues a small piece  
      of wood in the groove     

141
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,294
         at the midpoint        

142
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,831
    so the groove won't show    
    when the cover is open.     

143
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,836
 now he saws the casket cover in
 two, right through the bridge. 

144
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,045
           meanwhile,           
    another worker assembles    

145
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,180
    the bottom of the casket,   
         called the box.        

146
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,851
   he glues together the sides  
  and applies a bottom molding, 

147
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,321
       securing everything      
      with joint fasteners.     

148
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,658
         at this point,         
     the box is upside down.    

149
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,727
     he attaches the bottom,    

150
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,462
           then flips           
     the box right-side up.     

151
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,634
 now it's time to join the cover
   and box, using four hinges.  

152
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,010
      they spray the casket     

153
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,612
  with one of countless shades  
         of wood stain,         

154
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,583
     then rub it in equally     
    over the entire surface.    

155
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,560
  the casket goes into an oven  
  for an hour to dry the stain. 

156
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,031
      next a worker sprays      
    on two coats of lacquer,    

157
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,834
   with 40 minutes drying time  
      between applications.     

158
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,304
       this happens to be       
      a high-gloss finish,      

159
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,606
         but many models        
      have a duller sheen.      

160
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,777
     once the lacquer dries,    
   a worker attaches handles.   

161
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,381
 the more expensive the casket, 
    the fancier the features.   

162
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,917
    this higher-end oak model   
     with decorative corners    

163
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,786
            has wood            
    and metal swing handles.    

164
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,855
          other models          
  have all-metal swing handles  

165
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,925
          or fixed bars         
  made of wood, metal, or both. 

166
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,996
  the fancier caskets also have 
an adjustable wooden bed inside,

167
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,532
        with a mechanism        
      to adjust the height.     

168
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,334
     a worker covers the bed    
           in fabric.           

169
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:07,071
       the base-model bed       
   is made of absorbent paper   

170
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,274
       laid over a product      
        called wood wool,       

171
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,842
 which is simply shredded wood. 

172
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,280
the upholsterer lines the inside
    of the casket with foam,    

173
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,685
 covering it with either velvet,
 satin, or silk polyester crepe.

174
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,153
      by folding, nailing,      

175
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,956
    and stapling this fabric    
         a certain way,         

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,560
  she creates pleats, tufting,  
    and other design details.   

177
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:31,162
           generally,           
 the more expensive the casket, 

178
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:35,166
    the finer the fabric, and   
 the more ornate the upholstery.

179
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,370
       a decorative trim        
       hides the staples.       

180
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:47,178
 fabric straps, or metal elbow  
 brackets, hold the cover open. 

181
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,781
      there's just no limit     

182
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:52,917
 to how beautiful and elaborate 
         caskets can be.        

183
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,864
            narrator:           
     the soft drink was born    
 at the drugstore soda fountain,

184
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,600
where pharmacists would serve up

185
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,269
         various flavors        
      of carbonated water,      

186
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,338
      initially considered      
       a medicinal drink.       

187
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,674
  these sodas became so popular 
that customers wanted to be able

188
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,410
     to buy them in bottles     
          to take home.         

189
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,280
       that demand spawned      
    the soft-drink industry.    

190
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:31,356
   in 2003, almost 195 billion  
      liters of soft drinks     

191
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,825
   were sold around the world.  

192
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,962
        that's 30 liters        
   for every person on earth.   

193
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,297
  these 2-liter plastic bottles 

194
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,366
        have just arrived       
    from the bottle factory.    

195
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,802
           even though          
   they're brand-new bottles,   

196
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,037
      the soft-drink plant      
     still has to clean them    

197
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,106
      before filling them.      

198
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,909
      this rinsing machine      
 turns the bottles upside down, 

199
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,179
  then flushes them with water  
   the plant filters on-site.   

200
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,587
   once the water drains out,   

201
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,590
  the machine turns the bottles 
      right-side up again.      

202
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,393
     and they make their way    
     to the filling station.    

203
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,462
 meanwhile, in the mixing room, 

204
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,531
       technicians prepare      
       whatever soft drink      

205
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,668
       they'll be bottling      
     in this production run.    

206
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,335
       each recipe begins       
      with filtered water.      

207
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,139
  it makes up 86% of the drink. 

208
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,940
       the rest is syrup.       

209
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,942
        each syrup recipe       
        is a combination        

210
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,944
      of carefully measured     
          ingredients,          

211
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,547
 natural and artificial coloring
         and flavoring,         

212
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,417
  and one or more various types 
            of sugar,           

213
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,219
   such as glucose or fructose  

214
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,821
      extracted from beets,     
         corn, or cane.         

215
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,225
      this machine releases     

216
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,960
  the right proportion of syrup 
       to filtered water,       

217
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,696
  creating the final soft drink 
       minus the bubbles.       

218
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,099
      the drink now travels     
      to a pressurized tank     

219
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,767
     called the carbonator.     

220
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,570
       there an injection       
       of carbon dioxide        

221
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,240
        infuses the drink       
        with gas bubbles.       

222
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,109
    the carbonated soft drink   
           now travels          

223
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,712
        to the reservoir        
    of the bottling machine.    

224
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:03,314
       the bottles arrive       
    and travel its carousel.    

225
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,317
   the machine removes the air  
         in each bottle,        

226
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,888
     then fills it with, in     
 this case, two liters of cola. 

227
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,943
 now on to the capping machine. 

228
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,413
   the caps come down a chute   
   propelled by filtered air.   

229
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,014
    the machine twists a cap    

230
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,217
    on the part of the bottle   
        called the crimp,       

231
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,019
    intertwining the threads    
  of the cap and crimp tightly  

232
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,788
to hermetically seal the bottle.

233
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,493
      next stop, labeling.      

234
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,629
      the machine's roller      
        applies cold glue       

235
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,564
       to one metal plate       
         after another.         

236
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,569
  each plate then grabs a label 
   and applies it to a bottle.  

237
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,012
   brushes smooth edges down,   
ensuring the labels adhere well.

238
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,918
     elsewhere in the plant,    
  a machine called the uncaser  

239
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,521
          unloads cases         
   of refillable glass bottles  

240
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,656
       that have come back      
         to the factory.        

241
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,260
       the cases continue       
 toward a case-washing machine. 

242
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,663
  the dirty bottles head toward 
   the bottle-washing machine,  

243
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,333
   where devices called cells   
   line them up in rows of 16.  

244
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,204
  each bottle tilts and enters  
     the washer neck-first.     

245
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,674
      inside, a combination     
 of powerful water jets and soap

246
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,142
     remove dirt and germs.     

247
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,946
         then water jets        
  rinse off all traces of soap. 

248
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:46,484
as they exit, they pass in front
   of a neon inspection light.  

249
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,088
workers pull any problem bottles
          off the line.         

250
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,025
now the bottles head to the same
   bottling machine as before,  

251
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,827
   only now it's been adjusted  
       to fill each bottle      

252
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,765
with 10 fluid ounces of drink --
   in this case, orange soda.   

253
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,237
   this factory takes a sample  
    from each production run    

254
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,105
  for quality-control testing.  

255
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,107
       the lab technicians      
        check such things       

256
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,176
      as the dilution ratio     
       of syrup to water,       

257
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,980
    the carbonization level,    
     and the airtight seal.     

258
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,717
  they also analyze the purity  
   of the drink and container   

259
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,654
      by running the sample     
     through a paper filter.    

260
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,194
       they put the filter      
         in a petri dish        

261
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:34,131
 containing the nutrients needed
    to grow micro-organisms.    

262
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,067
       then they incubate       
    at a precise temperature    

263
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,403
           and observe          
      if any bacteria grow.     

264
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,740
       these glass bottles      
 have old-fashioned bottle caps,

265
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,476
       not the twist caps       
    the plastic bottles have.   

266
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,212
     as each cap drops down     
         onto a bottle,         

267
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:52,150
the machine squeezes it tightly,
   creating an airtight seal.   

268
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,820
        once the bottles        
     are filled and capped,     

269
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,256
  they go into shipping cases.  

270
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,971
            narrator:           
    a glider rocker combines    
   the back-and-forth movement  

271
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,571
 of a traditional rocking chair 

272
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,441
     with the gliding motion    
           of a swing.          

273
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,377
     parents often buy them     
 to rock their infants to sleep 

274
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,911
  or soothe them while feeding. 

275
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,913
    other models are designed   
           for people           

276
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,449
   who like to rock and glide   

277
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,952
  while having a conversation,  
 reading a book, or watching tv.

278
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,726
         glider rockers         
 come in a few different styles.

279
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,662
   some are made of solid wood  
   with a variety of cushions.  

280
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,332
others have a metal frame that's
partially or fully upholstered. 

281
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,468
    the first step is to cut    
         the dried wood         

282
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,736
   to the required dimensions   

283
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,939
          using laser-          
    and computer-guided saws.   

284
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,008
  the species this factory uses 
      for its wooden models     

285
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,744
   are maple, oak, and ash --   

286
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,946
       hardwoods known for      
 their strength and durability. 

287
00:16:55,948 --> 00:17:00,752
 then a computerized, industrial
   router/shaper forms tenons.  

288
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,420
     a tenon is a projection    
     on the end of one piece    

289
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,391
 that fits into a cavity, called
  a mortise, on another piece.  

290
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,764
         another shaper         
 profiles the seat-frame pieces 

291
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,868
         four at a time.        

292
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,395
     workers glue each tenon    
  and mortise together by hand, 

293
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,630
      then clamp the joint.     

294
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,199
      once the glue cures,      

295
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,536
      these joints will be      
    virtually indestructible.   

296
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,137
       with the glue dry,       

297
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,606
     the seat frame moves on    
       to the next phase.       

298
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,077
 another automated router/shaper
   gives it the final contour.  

299
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,150
        next they smooth        
     the surface of the wood    

300
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,821
       using successively       
       finer sandpapers.        

301
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,960
 now they bore a series of holes

302
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,964
   for attaching the armrests   
     and back of the chair.     

303
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,099
   precision is critical here.  

304
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,703
   they assemble those pieces   
  in a custom-made assembly jig 

305
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,438
 to ensure their exact position 
            and angle           

306
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,808
 before screwing them in place. 

307
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:41,118
  now they attach what's called 
  the multiposition mechanism.  

308
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,054
 this enables the glider-rocker 

309
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,790
    to lock in six different    
       comfort positions.       

310
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,893
  this part, called a trammel,  
       controls the angle.      

311
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:56,066
ball bearings located at the top
 and bottom of the chair's arms 

312
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,736
      are key to a smooth,      
         gliding motion.        

313
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,940
        secured solidly,        
    they'll last a lifetime.    

314
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,344
   workers assemble the parts   

315
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,613
          that make up          
 the rocking/gliding mechanism. 

316
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,560
     finally, they slide it     
      under the seat frame      

317
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,097
          and attach it         
 to the multiposition mechanism.

318
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,368
          it's critical         
     that the fit be precise    

319
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,305
          for the chair         
      to operate properly.      

320
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,720
  meanwhile, work is under way  
  in the upholstery department. 

321
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,191
 there are many different styles
 and colors of fabric available.

322
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,993
  workers stack several layers  
      of seat-cover fabric      

323
00:19:55,995 --> 00:20:00,531
   for a given model in a pile  
   to cut several in one shot.  

324
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,934
          the pile lies         
    on a textured rubber mat    

325
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,902
  held steady by a vacuum press 
        so it won't move        

326
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,539
  while the computerized cutter 
         does its work.         

327
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,274
    after the pieces are cut,   

328
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,177
        a seamstress sews       
   the zippered seat cushions.  

329
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,956
another vacuum press temporarily
   squashes the seat cushions,  

330
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,626
        enabling workers        
  to insert one in each cover.  

331
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,095
           the cushion          
  isn't a simple block of foam. 

332
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,430
             rather,            
  it's a triple-decker sandwich 

333
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,100
    composed of two different   
        densities of foam       

334
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,170
       glued together with      
 a multilayered polyester fiber.

335
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,239
   the fiber gives the cushion  
   more depth and smoothness.   

336
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,976
       the different foams      
maximize comfort and durability.

337
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,845
      the plastic wrapping      
     has no structural role.    

338
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:51,716
        it's merely part        
      of the vacuum system.     

339
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,853
 relaxing in a glider rocker can
 be a very soothing experience. 

340
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,522
        picture yourself        
   in front of the fireplace,   

341
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,658
          legs resting          
      on a gliding ottoman,     

342
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,993
       relaxing your back       
       after a long day,        

343
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:07,465
  reading, listening to music,  
      or just daydreaming.      

344
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,405
