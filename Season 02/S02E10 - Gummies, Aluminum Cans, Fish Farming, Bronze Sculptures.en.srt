00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,358
narrator: today on "how it's made,"

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,360
gummies,

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,162
aluminum cans,

6
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,899
fish farming, and bronze sculptures.

7
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,838
there's nothing kids love more

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,708
than candies they can pull and stretch,

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,710
which probably explains why gummy candies and licorice

10
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,513
have always been stick-to-your-teeth favorites,

11
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,184
except with parents who don't have a family dental plan.

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,325
everyone calls this red licorice,

13
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,460
but there's actually no licorice root in it.

14
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,397
the ingredients are wheat, sugar, and corn syrup,

15
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,999
with red food dye

16
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,068
and both artificial and natural strawberry flavoring.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,073
they cook the mixture for 2 hours at 216 degrees.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,342
this slowly forms a thick paste.

19
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,882
they cool it down, then put it through extruders.

20
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,818
the extruders work like icing nozzles,

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,422
shaping the paste into a design
such as the twirls we see here.

22
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,496
a water-lubricated knife slices the continuous strips

23
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,932
into 7- and 8-inch lengths.

24
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:46,171
the water also rinses off any licorice buildup on the blade.

25
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:01,253
the cut licorice goes on aluminum trays.

26
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,388
the stacks of trays then go into an oven

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,325
to dry for 8 hours at 140 degrees.

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,795
as the excess moisture evaporates,

29
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,396
the licorice shrivels.

30
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,708
workers weigh the correct amount
of licorice for each package.

31
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,423
to make gummy candies,

32
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,825
they use what are called printing boards --

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,228
large sheets with raised shapes.

34
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,300
to make gummy worms, for example,

35
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,104
they mount the gummy-worm board
on a stamping machine.

36
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,372
the machine then stamps the worm shapes

37
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,175
onto trays of cornstarch.

38
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,777
this creates a series of cornstarch molds

39
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,780
for the gummy worms.

40
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,661
while that's going on,

41
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,965
another machine mixes gelatin, sugar, corn syrup,

42
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:24,503
color, and flavoring and cooks the mixture at 240 degrees.

43
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,741
a machine called the depositor

44
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:33,045
pours the mixture into the cornstarch worm molds.

45
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,020
the molds then go into a refrigerated room.

46
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,891
in 12 to 15 hours, the candies cool and solidify.

47
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:03,308
a machine then flips the candies
out of the trays.

48
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,110
the cornstarch molds disintegrate.

49
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,648
as they fall downward, the machine sifts out the lumps,

50
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,317
then recycles the used cornstarch

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,786
into new cornstarch trays for the next batch.

52
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,861
the candies go through a cleaner.

53
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,665
as they spin, air nozzles blast off the cornstarch.

54
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,344
the next drum coats the candies
with mineral oil

55
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,146
to make them shiny.

56
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,361
children love gummy worms

57
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:00,032
because they're gooey and slippery and wiggly,

58
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,901
but it's not just kids who are hooked on them.

59
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:06,138
many fishermen actually use them for bait.

60
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,244
before packaging the candies,

61
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,780
the workers weed out any that are stretched out

62
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,648
or stuck together.

63
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,352
wonder if they get to eat the rejects?

64
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,397
narrator: a prion is what causes
killer neurological diseases

65
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,601
such as mad cow in animals and creutzfeldt-jakob in humans.

66
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,072
it's a protein normally found in the membranes of cells.

67
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,073
scientists are trying to determine

68
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,943
what changes that protein to an abnormal form

69
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,246
to cause these fatal brain diseases.

70
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:57,622
the next time you buy a canned soft drink, consider this --

71
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:01,293
that aluminum can will always be recyclable.

72
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,696
unlike plastic, aluminum never deteriorates,

73
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,333
no matter how often it's melted down and used again.

74
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,374
aluminum cans are so lightweight
that it's hard to believe

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,110
they're made from a huge roll of aluminum sheeting

76
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,514
that weighs almost 10 tons.

77
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,983
the sheet is about 5 feet wide

78
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,919
and as thin as construction paper.

79
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,788
a roll like this is long enough

80
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,492
to make three-quarters of a million drink cans.

81
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,596
the sheet feeds into a press that punches out round pieces

82
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,365
that will be formed into cans.

83
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:46,471
the punch press actually performs two operations.

84
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,409
it punches out a disc 5 1/2 inches in diameter,

85
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,878
then bends it into a cup.

86
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,950
what's left of the sheet

87
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,019
gets compacted and sent back to the aluminum factory,

88
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:06,425
where it's recycled into new rolls.

89
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:09,427
the cup goes into a machine

90
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,096
called the draw-and-iron body maker.

91
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,234
a tool draws out the aluminum, forming the body of the can.

92
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,237
the tool is lubricated so it won't tear the aluminum

93
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,839
while stretching it.

94
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,308
the lubricant also acts as a coolant

95
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,012
because the aluminum heats up as it's being worked.

96
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,650
once the body is formed,

97
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,387
a trimmer cleans and straightens the edge.

98
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,266
now the cans move along upside down on the conveyer belt

99
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,235
over to the washer.

100
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,550
the washer performs a 6-stage cleaning.

101
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,354
the first two washes are in hydrofluoric acid

102
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,823
at 140 degrees.

103
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,159
the last four washes are in deionized water,

104
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,499
neutral water with no ph, also at 140 degrees.

105
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,900
the cans come out of the washer

106
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,704
and go under a hot-air dryer.

107
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:29,107
they're now shiny because the hydrofluoric-acid wash

108
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,777
removed a thin surface layer of aluminum.

109
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,914
next, a roller passes over the cans,

110
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,383
coating the bottom rims with varnish.

111
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,918
this varnish coating

112
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,787
allows the cans to slide easily
on the conveyer belts

113
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,923
and into vending machines.

114
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,260
it shows up as a blue ring under an ultraviolet light.

115
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,198
the cans are now ready to be printed.

116
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
this rotation printing system can apply up to five colors,

117
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,869
one at a time.

118
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:06,711
the machine then applies a layer
of varnish to protect the ink.

119
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,552
this is what the print and varnish process

120
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,687
looks like in slow motion,

121
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:21,226
and here's the actual speed -- 1,800 cans per minute.

122
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,497
next, the cans fly through an oven

123
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,433
that instantly hardens the ink

124
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,434
and dries the protective varnish.

125
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,902
the next machine

126
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,039
sprays a water-based varnish on the inside of the cans.

127
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,043
this creates a barrier between the drink and the aluminum,

128
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,912
so the drink won't end up tasting like metal.

129
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,713
it also prevents the aluminum

130
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,982
from being eaten away from the inside

131
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,852
by the acid in carbonated drinks.

132
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,189
next, the cans go through a machine called the necker

133
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,525
which forms a 2-inch neck on the can.

134
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,061
this is done gradually in 11 steps,

135
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,998
so as not to puncture the paper-thin aluminum.

136
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,469
the next machine, called the flanger,

137
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,338
forms a curved-over edge at the top of the can,

138
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,275
which will later attach to the pull-tab cover.

139
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,681
the cans pass through a sophisticated vision system

140
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,217
that photographs the inside of each can.

141
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,486
any can that doesn't meet standards,

142
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,888
that has a bump or ink inside, for example,

143
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,958
is automatically removed from the production line.

144
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,229
they strap the finished cans onto a pallet.

145
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,698
from here, they're shipped to the drink company,

146
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,302
which fills them and then attaches the pull-tab cover.

147
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,180
narrator: fish farming generates about 20%
of the world's fish production.

148
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,849
some fish farms are very high tech,

149
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,986
while others use more traditional methods.

150
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,989
fish farming began in 2000 b.c.

151
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,729
if these rainbow trout

152
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,198
are going to have the energy to make baby trout,

153
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,667
they'll have to be well fed.

154
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,070
on today's menu -- brown shrimp.

155
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,309
the fish farmer gives the mating process a hand.

156
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,214
he takes the female fish

157
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,350
and presses on her belly to squeeze out her eggs.

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:31,355
a 1-pound fish has about 1,000 eggs.

159
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,893
it takes about a minute to get them out.

160
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,585
next, he takes the male fish and squeezes out his sperm.

161
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,221
this also takes about a minute.

162
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,731
the fertilization process is pretty low tech --

163
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,800
no microscopes, no test tubes.

164
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,837
the farmer mixes the eggs and sperm by hand.

165
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,541
he then rinses the eggs with clean water.

166
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,678
he repeats this step seven or eight times

167
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,780
until the water runs clear.

168
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,360
the eggs that stay at the surface are duds,

169
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,162
so they're discarded.

170
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,966
the farmer transfers the good eggs to bottles,

171
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,901
then fills the bottles to the top with water.

172
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,304
the eggs incubate for about a month.

173
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,841
by the 25-day mark, if an egg is alive,

174
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:01,179
two little black dots appear --
fish eyes.

175
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,253
after the incubation period,

176
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,522
the farmer empties the bottles

177
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,458
and spreads the eggs on a surface with slats.

178
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,395
the eggs lie here underwater...

179
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,274
...until they hatch 10 to 15 days later.

180
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,009
the newly hatched trout

181
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,213
swim down through the slats into the basin below.

182
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,825
the baby trout feed off their placenta for the first 18 days.

183
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:55,033
after that, they eat special trout food made of fish meal.

184
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,110
the trout grow to about 8 inches long

185
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,178
by the age of 8 months.

186
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,182
at that point, the smaller trout
swimming around them

187
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,184
start looking pretty appetizing.

188
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,521
so the farmer has to classify the fish by size

189
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,859
and move them into separate basins.

190
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,359
trout reach adulthood at the age
of a year and a half.

191
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:58,229
now the farmer transfers them into his man-made lake.

192
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,505
from here, the fish will go to market.

193
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,051
but before they leave, the farmer mates them,

194
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,620
starting the cycle all over again.

195
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,703
narrator: bronze is the oldest metal alloy known to man.

196
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:42,473
it is ideal for casting works of art because, when molten,

197
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,010
it flows into even the tiniest crevices of a mold.

198
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,747
this allows sculptors to achieve
incredible detail in their work.

199
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:01,826
man first discovered how to cast metal around 3500 b.c.,

200
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,929
during the period known as the bronze age.

201
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,035
many civilizations honored their royalty and gods

202
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,104
with bronze statues.

203
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,106
when it comes to art,

204
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,710
the late 19th-century french sculptor auguste rodin

205
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,644
was the master.

206
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,447
they say his bronzes

207
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,716
were more lifelike than the subjects themselves.

208
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,786
bronze is also a popular medium
for modern art.

209
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,738
sculptors first carve a replica
of their sculpture from wood

210
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,409
or shape it out of a plaster or clay.

211
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,344
they coat it with a lubricant...

212
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,816
then with silicone rubber.

213
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:13,430
when the rubber hardens about six hours later,

214
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,500
the lubricated replica slips out easily,

215
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,503
leaving a detailed rubber mold.

216
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,441
next, they pour hot wax into the mold.

217
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,320
the wax cools in about 15 minutes,

218
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,457
leaving an exact wax replica of the sculpture.

219
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,738
next, they attach what's called a sprew --

220
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,909
a wax channel that will funnel the molten bronze into the mold.

221
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,664
they dip the wax replica into a ceramic material.

222
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,639
then coat it with powdered silicone,

223
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,776
a common mineral, to strengthen the ceramic.

224
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,249
next stop -- an autoclave.

225
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:43,521
in about 10 minutes, under the machine's hot steam pressure,

226
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,123
the wax inside the ceramic shell
melts away,

227
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,061
leaving a hardened and hollow ceramic mold.

228
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:05,143
that mold goes into a kiln at 1,560 degrees.

229
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,878
after two hours, it's fired.

230
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,084
this is the finished mold into which the bronze will be cast.

231
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:17,622
at the foundry, they heat the bronze to 2,084 degrees...

232
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:23,427
then carefully pour it into the mold.

233
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,966
the molten metal takes just a few minutes to solidify.

234
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,902
then they chisel off the ceramic casing

235
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,438
to reveal the bronze statue inside.

236
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,952
they sandblast the statue to remove the ceramic residue.

237
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,798
then, they saw off the sprew.

238
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:09,040
they weld shut any holes or other imperfections...

239
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,580
then polish the statue using various abrasive heads.

240
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:22,453
they heat the statue, then spray on an acid coating.

241
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,958
this coating, called patina,

242
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,061
gives the bronze its shimmer and richness of color.

243
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,420
finally, a coat of wax makes the statue shine.
