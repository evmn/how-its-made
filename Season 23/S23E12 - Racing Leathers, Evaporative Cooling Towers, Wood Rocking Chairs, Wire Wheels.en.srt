    discovery communications

00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,520
            narrator:           
 with no car frame around them, 

4
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:59,058
     motorcycle racers look     
to their clothes for protection.

5
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,327
     one-piece suits called     
   racing leathers provide it.  

6
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:05,530
 they're made of padded leather,

7
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:09,268
  and the design is form-fitting
         and aerodynamic.       

8
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:17,809
   motorcycle racing leathers   
    are a kind of body armor.   

9
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,746
      equipped with padding     
          and airbags,          

10
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,815
 the suit is a protective shell.

11
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,618
      it must fit the rider     
       like a second skin.      

12
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,689
to achieve this, racing leathers

13
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,892
     are usually custom made    
    by a team of specialists.   

14
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,227
 they take over 40 measurements 

15
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,430
          as the racer          
    assumes different poses.    

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
        the pattern maker       

17
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,369
     types the measurements     
        into a computer.        

18
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,840
    special software creates    
     a pattern for the suit.    

19
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,043
 she assembles the pattern parts
          on the screen         

20
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,778
     to ensure they match up    

21
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,715
   and then sends the drawings  
          to a printer.         

22
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:59,051
            it prints           
     the life-sized patterns    

23
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,887
        onto large sheets       
     of thin tracing paper.     

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,194
a member of the team then sprays

25
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,931
 the backs of the paper patterns
         with adhesive.         

26
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,835
    she presses the patterns    
    onto sheets of cardboard.   

27
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,939
   she cuts out the cardboard   

28
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,341
      following the designs     
          on the paper.         

29
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,610
      the cardboard backing     

30
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,480
       gives the patterns       
  a more substantial structure. 

31
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:32,150
   before cutting the leather,  

32
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,754
       they clamp a sample      
      in an automated tool      

33
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,090
    that moves it repeatedly    
  across a piece of sandpaper.  

34
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,826
       this confirms that       
  the leather is strong enough  

35
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,028
          to withstand          
      significant abrasion.     

36
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:46,432
       they apply graphics      
         to the patterns        

37
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,967
   to estimate the placement,   

38
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,836
 and then they're ready to cut. 

39
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:54,373
the cutter carves into the white
   leather with a thin blade.   

40
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,109
      he follows the lines      
         of the pattern         

41
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,377
  and leaves a generous margin. 

42
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:03,516
      the parts will be cut     
      more precisely later.     

43
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,787
 he transfers the leather panels
    to a large sheet of paper   

44
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:12,458
    stretched across the bed    
     of a printing machine.     

45
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,526
 light glue applied to the paper

46
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,797
    keeps the leather pieces    
    in place during printing.   

47
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:21,533
       the printer's jets       
  spray designs onto the parts. 

48
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,601
          it uses inks          

49
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:26,439
    that have been specially    
     formulated for leather.    

50
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:30,943
            the inks            
    start to dry immediately,   

51
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:34,680
   but they leave the printed   
    leather to set overnight    

52
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,947
        for a full cure.        

53
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,018
              next,             
  using a hinged scissor frame, 

54
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,687
     they stretch and expand    
       an elastic fabric.       

55
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,224
      a member of the team      
         sprays adhesive        

56
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,826
          onto the back         
       of a leather panel.      

57
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:51,163
  she presses a piece of kevlar 
        onto the leather,       

58
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,698
     and this reinforces it.    

59
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,567
         she then places        
  the kevlar and leather panel  

60
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,768
          on the fabric         

61
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,505
    that's still pulled tight   
      in the scissor frame.     

62
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,708
          she stitches          
   the leather and kevlar part  

63
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,879
   to the stretched material,   
   creating a ribbed pattern.   

64
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,519
     she now cuts the panel     
    to its final dimensions.    

65
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,521
  the elastic fabric contracts, 

66
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,058
  causing the leather to pucker 
   into accordion-like folds.   

67
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:24,330
          a seamstress          
    stitches the ribbed panel   

68
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,399
           to the back          
 of the motorcycle racing suit. 

69
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,201
     it takes over 200 parts    

70
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:32,538
           to achieve           
   the desired shape and fit.   

71
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,741
          some of them,         
 like these shoulder protectors,

72
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,810
   are made of molded plastic   
            and foam.           

73
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,381
  they're designed to dissipate 
     the force of an impact.    

74
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,352
  meanwhile, at a test station, 

75
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,887
        they slam weights       
     into a molded knee pad     

76
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,291
     and measure the energy     
        that penetrates.        

77
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,426
    now a member of the team    

78
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:58,096
     inserts a pair of pads     
      into suit leg pockets     

79
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,432
  and secures them with velcro. 

80
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,768
 the suit is ready for airbags. 

81
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:05,771
        she installs them       
       over the shoulders.      

82
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,239
  she tucks the microprocessor  

83
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,375
   and gas inflation canisters  
          in the hump.          

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,779
   this is an aerodynamic part  
    at the back of the suit.    

85
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:18,717
    she connects the sensors    
   and powers up the airbags.   

86
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,519
   l.e.d. lights on the sleeve  
           illuminate,          

87
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:25,057
           indicating           
    that they're operational.   

88
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:29,595
 with the leather suit complete,
  they sew a microfiber liner.  

89
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,864
      the liner wicks sweat     
       away from the body,      

90
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,333
 making the suit cooler to wear.

91
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,473
       the racer suits up       
       and tests the fit,       

92
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,076
          and they make         
     any final alterations.     

93
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,411
      these racing leathers     
          are now ready         

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,315
   for the thrills and spills   
          of the sport.         

95
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,699
            narrator:           
   evaporative cooling towers   

96
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,967
      keep large buildings      
  and industrial machines cool. 

97
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,569
       circulating liquid       

98
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,971
     carries the excess heat    
      to the cooling tower,     

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,640
typically installed on the roof.

100
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,309
    the tower uses cold water   
       to cool that fluid,      

101
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,845
     then transfers the heat    
        to the atmosphere       

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,214
 through an evaporation process.

103
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:27,119
      pumps move the fluid      
    carrying the excess heat    

104
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:30,122
   through the cooling tower's  
      closed-circuit coil.      

105
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,525
     nozzles spray the coil     
        with cold water.        

106
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,794
         the spray water        
        absorbs the heat,       

107
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,864
      and the cooled fluid      
    returns to the building.    

108
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,133
          fans blow air         
  onto the now warm spray water 

109
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:44,203
    to evaporate just enough    
      to release the heat.      

110
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:47,806
      then the cooled water     
 loops back to the spray system,

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,208
     and the cycle repeats.     

112
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,077
     depending on the size,     

113
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,747
       the coil is made up      
   of as many as 56 circuits.   

114
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:59,685
  a circuit is a zigzagged tube 
      one inch in diameter.     

115
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,757
   the mill forms a continuous  
          straight tube         

116
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,959
  from a strip of carbon steel. 

117
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,095
 the rollers progressively curve
        the edges upward        

118
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,631
   until they join at the top.  

119
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,366
  the last station on the mill  

120
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:20,272
 welds the joined edges together
   to form a continuous seam.   

121
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,577
          next, workers         
   transfer the straight tube   

122
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:30,049
to a semi-automated tube bender,
 which forms it into a circuit. 

123
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,392
      depending on the size     
         of the circuit,        

124
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,595
 there can be as few as 6 bends 
        or as many as 18.       

125
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,132
 to make a circuit with 18 bends

126
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:52,071
   can require a straight tube  
   that's over 300 feet long.   

127
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,617
once all the circuits are ready,
 workers stack them on a frame, 

128
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,820
     then weld the tube ends    

129
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,757
   to the corresponding holes   
        of a steel plate.       

130
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:16,628
     they close up the plate    
  with a cover called a header. 

131
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,030
    after clamping the header   
          in position,          

132
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:23,168
     they weld it in place,     
 forming a pressure-tight seal. 

133
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,575
            the coil            
    is now fully constructed    

134
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,243
     and ready for testing.     

135
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,446
           technicians          
      submerge it in water,     

136
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,849
      then pump air through     
        at high pressure        

137
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,050
      and look for bubbles,     

138
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,852
      which would indicate      
      a leak in a circuit.      

139
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,521
     if they do find a leak,    

140
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,190
       they either repair       
     or replace the circuit.    

141
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,526
  meanwhile, work is under way  

142
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,795
     on the cooling tower's     
       mechanical section.      

143
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:53,532
 a computer-guided laser cutter 
    prepares the steel panels   

144
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,269
   that make up the section's   
        rugged structure.       

145
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,871
  workers then bend the panels  
         where required         

146
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,741
         with a machine         
      called a press brake.     

147
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:05,077
 then, they assemble the panels 
     to build the structure.    

148
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,349
           meanwhile,           
   another team has assembled   

149
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,684
    the mechanical section's    
            ceiling,            

150
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,285
     which houses the fans.     

151
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,489
       workers lower this       
       onto the structure.      

152
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:21,092
 inside the mechanical section, 
      they install the belt     

153
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:24,563
  that links the motor's pulley 
       to each fan pulley.      

154
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,835
 after tightening the belt screw
     with an impact wrench,     

155
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,204
       they test the fans.      

156
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:38,911
       meanwhile, the coil      
 has been dipped in molten zinc 

157
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,647
 to make it corrosion-resistant.

158
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,981
        workers mount it        

159
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,917
   next to the cooling tower's  
       mechanical section.      

160
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,519
          they cover it         
      with a steel housing      

161
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,723
         and install the        
water-spray system on top of it.

162
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,793
     the sprayed cold water     
        absorbs the heat        

163
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,863
   from the fluid circulating   
        through the coil.       

164
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,599
  the fans then cool the water  
         by evaporation         

165
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:04,202
      as it flows downward      
 through a bundle of pvc sheets.

166
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:07,806
 the machine first heats the pvc
          to soften it,         

167
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,875
         then stamps it         
      with the mold plate.      

168
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,478
          this imprints         
      a proprietary pattern     

169
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,947
      of peaks and valleys.     

170
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,281
   this pattern is the secret   

171
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,750
       to the evaporative       
         cooling process        

172
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:21,553
    because it moves the air    
      and spreads the water     

173
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,958
            in a way            
   that maximizes efficiency.   

174
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,160
    workers stack the sheets    
        on pole supports        

175
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:32,030
      to construct a bundle     
         of 300 sheets.         

176
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,166
    after placing the bundle    
          in a housing,         

177
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,970
  they install it over a basin. 

178
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,105
           this basin           
    collects the cooled water   

179
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,574
   before it's pumped back up   
         to the sprayers        

180
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,243
      to repeat the cycle.      

181
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,112
   this completes the cooling   
      tower's lower module.     

182
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,448
        they now mate it        
     with the upper module,     

183
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,784
      containing the fans,      
     coil, and spray system.    

184
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,853
 this evaporative cooling tower 

185
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,522
     has more than 300 times    
          the capacity          

186
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,859
    of a typical residential    
    air-conditioning system.    

187
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,861
    now,<i> that's</i> pretty cool.    

188
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:16,808
            narrator:           
 the rocking chair was invented 

189
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,277
    back in the 18th century,   

190
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,478
 when when people first thought 
 of putting skates, or rockers, 

191
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:23,415
    on the bottom of chairs.    

192
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,084
the tilting movement it produces

193
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,220
     reminds us of a cradle     
       or a rocking horse,      

194
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:32,357
    which might be what makes   
  rocking chairs so comforting. 

195
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:39,164
 these stained jumbo rockers are
 caned in a herringbone pattern 

196
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,234
  with indonesian rattan vine.  

197
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,503
            22 pieces           
  of solid appalachian red oak  

198
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,974
   form the frame and the base  
    of these rocking chairs.    

199
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,043
            to start,           

200
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:54,512
the carpenter connects the tenon
    joints of the stretchers    

201
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,848
         to the mortises        
        of the back frame       

202
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,451
    and hammers them in place   
      with a rubber mallet.     

203
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,588
      a caner drains a coil     
         of binder cane,        

204
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,525
    which is soaked overnight   
     to make it more pliable    

205
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,461
 while weaving the back and seat
      of the rocking chair.     

206
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,265
           she uncoils          
     the rattan vine threads    

207
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,667
       and starts wrapping      
         the back frame         

208
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,135
       from bottom to top.      

209
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,204
the wrapping and weaving process
         for each chair         

210
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,740
     lasts about eight hours    

211
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,844
  and requires about 2,000 feet 
     of rattan vine threads.    

212
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,616
 when the caner reaches the end 
        of a rattan vine,       

213
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,087
     she fastens a new coil     
        to the first one.       

214
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,022
she staples the threads together

215
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,626
   and closes them tight with   
  a pair of needle-nose pliers. 

216
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,729
     she continues wrapping     
         the back frame.        

217
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,370
    she tightens the wrapping   
        around the frame,       

218
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:54,306
         leaving no gap         
    between the cane strands.   

219
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,709
 she then tucks the final strand
  underneath one of the rails.  

220
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,180
         she now starts         
       the weaving process      

221
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,915
   moving from left to right,   

222
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,052
       using the wrapping       
 as a base grid for the pattern.

223
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:11,656
 each thread passes over three, 
     then goes under three.     

224
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:12,991
    she turns the frame over    

225
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,094
 to weave the back of the frame 
      in the same fashion.      

226
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:21,533
    the challenge is to keep    
 the weaving straight and sleek 

227
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,535
     to give it the classic     
       herringbone finish.      

228
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,539
    a carpenter attaches side   
 stretchers to the front posts, 

229
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:32,344
   which are already assembled  
      to the front rounds.      

230
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,147
    he hammers the pieces in    
      with a rubber mallet      

231
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,884
  and assembles the seat frame  
      with the back posts.      

232
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,686
    there's no need for glue.   

233
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,090
  the seat caning will solidify 
     the rocker's structure.    

234
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:49,894
  a caner uses the same rattan  
 vine that was used on the back 

235
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,763
     to wrap the seat frame.    

236
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,300
 he makes sure there are no gaps
   between the strands of cane  

237
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,270
    before he starts weaving    
    the herringbone pattern.    

238
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,641
            he weaves           
     the over-under pattern     

239
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,308
   in the center of the seat,   

240
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,978
    where there's more slack    
        in the wrapping.        

241
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,914
  then he pushes the threads up 
       with a wooden wedge      

242
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,051
      to tighten the caning     
      as much as possible.      

243
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,523
        straps reinforce        
   the structure of the chair   

244
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,394
 before the seat frame is caned.

245
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,663
     to ensure authenticity,    

246
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,799
       a carpenter brands       
 the left armrest of each chair 

247
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:33,605
 with the original branding iron
 used by the company since 1875.

248
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:36,607
     he hammers the armrest     
       into the back post.      

249
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,410
    then he aligns the spokes   
        of the front post       

250
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,813
  with the hole in the armrest. 

251
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:45,216
     a clamp keeps the back     
     and front post aligned     

252
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,085
  while he inserts the armrest. 

253
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,954
   a wooden wedge in the spoke  
      prevents the armrest      

254
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,291
       from disconnecting       
 from the front post over time. 

255
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:58,763
   the carpenter hammers it in  
      with a steel hammer.      

256
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,499
            the wedge           
   replaces the need for glue   

257
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,703
 and ensures a snug fit between 
 the armrest and the front post.

258
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,040
      the carpenter secures     
    the armrest to the chair    

259
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,376
           by drilling          
   a solid brass carriage bolt  

260
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,045
     through the back post.     

261
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,380
       with a belt sander,      

262
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,385
       he levels the wedge      
 and front post with the armrest

263
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,988
       and makes it smooth      
          to the touch.         

264
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,726
 before the runners, or rockers,
   are assembled to the base,   

265
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,261
 the carpenter stains the chair.

266
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,930
       the oil-based stain      
        protects the wood       

267
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:37,201
and brings out the natural grain
     of the solid oak frame.    

268
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:41,273
    the stain is then sealed    
 with two coats of clear varnish

269
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,009
        that will endure        
   high humidity levels, sun,   

270
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,878
      and climate changes.      

271
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,081
     the carpenter assembles    
     the runner to the base     

272
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,017
    and measures the distance   
       to the front post.       

273
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:57,689
  this ensures an even rocking  
    movement on every chair.    

274
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,526
         he fastens them        
   with brass carriage bolts.   

275
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,698
       the finished chairs      
  will endure the test of time  

276
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,234
           and provide          
   comfortable seating options  

277
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,970
 for both indoors and outdoors. 

278
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,453
            narrator:           
     wheels with wire spokes    

279
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,922
       ruled the highways       
        until the 1970s,        

280
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,591
     when they were replaced    
       by cast alloy ones.      

281
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,461
          but factories         
     still make wire wheels     

282
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,930
   for the classic car market   

283
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:43,802
 and for drivers who want to use
  them to customize their ride. 

284
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,207
           wire wheels          
   suspend the weight of a car  

285
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,076
   with flexible metal spokes   

286
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,213
           arranged in          
  a specific geometric pattern. 

287
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:59,951
           they start           
  with an aluminum alloy disc.  

288
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:04,656
a factory worker clamps the disc
  in a metal spinning machine.  

289
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:12,697
    this machine shapes metal   
 as if it were a piece of clay. 

290
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,301
        it spins the disc       
        at a high speed,        

291
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,504
     while a series of tools    
    press it to a round form.   

292
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:28,646
it takes 20 minutes to transform
 the flat disc into a wheel rim,

293
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,283
      complete with a bead      
          for the tire.         

294
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:37,188
           the process          
      also causes the metal     

295
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,991
           to undergo           
    molecular transformation,   

296
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,960
    and it becomes stronger.    

297
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,332
        after polishing,        
     a worker moves the rim     

298
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,267
          under a tool          
   that punches dimples in it.  

299
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,803
           the dimples          
      will accommodate nuts     

300
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,674
        that will be used       
      to secure the spokes.     

301
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,009
   he drills into the dimples   

302
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:02,013
         to create holes        
    for attaching the spokes.   

303
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,349
  he angles the holes slightly  

304
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,819
       so that the spokes       
         sit correctly.         

305
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,288
            he stamps           
    the wheel's design number   

306
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,691
      and other identifying     
           information          

307
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,360
       into the outer edge      
        of the wheel rim.       

308
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,932
       by now, the wheel's      
        steel centerpiece       

309
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,833
      has also taken shape.     

310
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,837
      an employee turns it      
        for even spacing,       

311
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,773
            as a tool           
    repeatedly punctures it.    

312
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,909
this creates rows of small holes

313
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:33,778
     in both the inner ring     
        and outer flange.       

314
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,648
         he then drills         
       those holes larger       

315
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:41,052
    to prepare for the spokes   
  to be assembled to the part.  

316
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,788
      at the next station,      

317
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,391
     a worker inserts spokes    
          into a press          

318
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,360
 that bends its ends with hooks.

319
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,929
  the angle of the hook varies  

320
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,863
      depending on the part     
          of the wheel          

321
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,666
the spoke is to be assembled to.

322
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,269
           he adjusts           
    the settings on the press   

323
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,772
 to achieve the different bends.

324
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,478
         then it's over         
      to an automatic blade     

325
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,881
 that cuts the spokes to length.

326
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,949
        this also varies.       

327
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,154
  they cut outer spokes longer  
     and inner ones shorter.    

328
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,227
          he now places         
     the ends of the spokes     

329
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,630
   in a device that rolls them  
    against a cutting block.    

330
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:29,501
 it carves threads in the metal 
        in mere seconds.        

331
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:35,640
   with the spokes now hooked,  
       cut, and threaded,       

332
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,543
         the wire wheel         
     is ready for assembly.     

333
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,582
       the employee hooks       
     the appropriate spokes     

334
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,052
         into the holes         
       in the centerpiece.      

335
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:51,322
   he places the aluminum rim   
     around the centerpiece.    

336
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:56,127
  he attaches the threaded ends 
    of the spokes to the rim    

337
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,930
        using steel nuts        
that fit into the tapered holes.

338
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,934
         he screws them         
       loosely into place.      

339
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,736
    he configures the spokes    

340
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,806
        in a criss-cross        
       geometric pattern,       

341
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:12,343
   specified by the engineers.  

342
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:16,748
    this pattern is designed    
  for strength and flexibility, 

343
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,317
   but it also gives the wheel  
        a visual appeal.        

344
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:26,157
 once he's laced all the spokes 
from the centerpiece to the rim,

345
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,526
    he tightens the fittings.   

346
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:35,400
   this secures the assembly,   
 but it's not the final torque. 

347
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:41,372
  they now transfer the loosely 
 assembled wire wheel to a shaft

348
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,909
    and turn a crank to lower   
 the centerpiece within the rim.

349
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,114
     this brings the spokes     
   into the correct position,   

350
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,449
   and a worker tightens them   
         substantially.         

351
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,786
         all 72 of them.        

352
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:57,589
   he does the final tweaking   
            by hand.            

353
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,258
   seven hours in the making,   

354
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,128
         this wire wheel        
      is now ready to roll.     

355
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:07,398
 with the rubber tire attached, 

356
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:11,469
 he secures the wheel to the car
    using a single large nut.   

357
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,337
   it's called a knockoff nut   

358
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,674
 because you simply knock it off
       to change the tire.      

359
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,409
   it's just one of the things  

360
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:22,280
    that makes the wire wheel   
        a classic choice.
