narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,994
inflatable watercraft...

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,732
...couscous...

4
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,238
...modeling dough...

5
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,943
...and wicker products.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,321
today's inflatable watercraft range from rafts and dinghies

7
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,057
to canoes and kayaks.

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,593
they're less expensive than conventional boats

9
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,662
and easier to store and transport.

10
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,930
you don't need a trailer --

11
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,067
just throw your boat in the trunk,

12
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,668
then unfold and inflate it

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,571
when you get to your aquatic destination.

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,277
whether it's a raft shooting the rapids

15
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,079
or a motorized boat gliding across a calm lake,

16
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,614
an inflatable watercraft

17
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,884
begins with sturdy, waterproof material.

18
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:32,424
this company uses pvc fabric .04 of an inch thick

19
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,960
that has a nylon or polyester fiber core.

20
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,629
after workers trace and cut out

21
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,765
the pieces that will form the boat,

22
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,467
they connect them with a strip of the same material,

23
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,572
fusing them together using a machine with a propane flame.

24
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,318
the intense heat melts the surface of the pvc

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,320
until the pieces bond.

26
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:06,125
here's that bonding action in slow motion.

27
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:11,863
next, they fuse a strip of pure pvc

28
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,533
to the underside of the joint.

29
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:17,402
this assures that air won't leak out of the boat

30
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,171
where the pieces connect.

31
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,343
inflating the boat

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,547
will pull on the material surrounding the air valve,

33
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,281
so they reinforce that area

34
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,819
with a round piece of pvc called a doubler.

35
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,289
this high-frequency welding machine

36
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,291
applies 280 pounds of pressure

37
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:43,761
and heat-generating f.m. waves to fuse the doubler in place.

38
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,432
then they cut a hole in the middle of the doubler

39
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,967
for the air valve.

40
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,175
next come the cones.

41
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,510
cones support the weight of the motor

42
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,112
and enable the boat to plane,

43
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:04,383
to rise above the water when traveling at high speed.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,387
using the propane-flame machine,

45
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,456
workers seal together the ends of the boat...

46
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,658
then insert the inside cone piece

47
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,996
just before they close it up completely.

48
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,965
they finish off the seal

49
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:23,401
using the high-frequency welding machine,

50
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,337
then pull the cone piece through.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,743
they inflate the boat

52
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,580
until the pressure forces the cone piece into place.

53
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:41,954
they seal all around it with heavy-duty caulking...

54
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:47,292
stick on the outside cone piece...

55
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:51,696
then screw it securely in place.

56
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,166
they fully inflate the boat to perfect the seal

57
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,202
and expel the excess caulking.

58
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,506
now they install what's called the transom,

59
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,441
a plank of wood that supports the motor

60
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,244
at the rear of the boat.

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,113
they cover it in boat fabric,

62
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,315
using a plastic resin-based glue

63
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,552
that's resistant to the fiery heat of the sun.

64
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,189
they apply the same glue to the piece of material

65
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,726
that will become the underside of the boat,

66
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,995
then position it in place.

67
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,869
after gluing on a bumper made of hard pvc,

68
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:34,806
they coat the boat's underside in a liquid plastic resin.

69
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,675
this protects the bottom

70
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,412
when the boat runs aground over rocks and sand.

71
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,813
they test-inflate the keel,

72
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:46,084
a stabilizer that runs the length of the boat.

73
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:51,156
then they deflate it and begin installing the floor.

74
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:54,626
the floor is made up of five connected pieces,

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,028
three made of aluminum

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,831
and two made of fiberglass, plastic, or wood.

77
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,435
the hole in the floor is for the keel's air valve.

78
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:06,838
after inflating the boat...

79
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,341
they inflate the keel.

80
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,247
now they take measurements

81
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,550
to determine where to position the oars.

82
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,387
first, they glue on the oarlocks,

83
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,590
the pieces that hold the oars in place.

84
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,925
the oars are made of aluminum,

85
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,962
so they're lightweight and they won't rust.

86
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,269
the motor is 6 horsepower to 50 horsepower,

87
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,838
depending on the size of the boat.

88
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,882
narrator: couscous is a traditional staple

89
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,151
of north african cuisine.

90
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,422
it looks like a grain, but it's actually pasta.

91
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:01,493
these days, few people make couscous from scratch.

92
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:02,761
even in north africa,

93
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,430
they usually buy their couscous ready-made

94
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,799
and just steam-cook it.

95
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,106
couscous is the product of culinary simplicity.

96
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:18,509
it's made from one ingredient and one ingredient alone --

97
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,047
wheat, most often, the durum species of wheat.

98
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,917
when you remove the grains, grind them,

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,019
and sift out the finer flour,

100
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,857
you're left with a coarser wheat flour called "semolina."

101
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,927
that's the flour from which they make couscous.

102
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,930
the first step is known as "hydration."

103
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,732
an automated food processor

104
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,735
measures about 1/3 water to 2/3 semolina,

105
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,505
then mixes them for 3 minutes.

106
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,475
the flour particles absorb the liquid

107
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,544
and bloat into a raw dough.

108
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:02,087
the dough particles then go into a rotating drum,

109
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,756
where they spin for seven minutes.

110
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,193
this rounds them into balls of varying sizes.

111
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,910
a screen inside the drum sifts out the big clumps.

112
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,987
the raw doughballs go into a giant steam-cooker

113
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,189
for 15 minutes.

114
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,860
the intense heat, over 210 degrees fahrenheit,

115
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:45,263
cooks the dough by gelatinizing
the starch in the wheat.

116
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:53,004
as the couscous balls exit the steam-cooker stuck together,

117
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,941
giant revolving blades break them up.

118
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:14,292
the soggy couscous now enters a rotating dryer,

119
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,295
where it spins for 18 minutes.

120
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,465
this removes 22% of the water.

121
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,634
the remaining moisture is necessary

122
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,304
to prevent the couscous from drying out in the package.

123
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,982
now the couscous pours out of the dryer

124
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:41,252
and onto the conveyor belt that
funnels it to the next station.

125
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,721
you can see that the balls are much drier

126
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,325
and relatively uniform in size,

127
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,528
but they're still steaming hot,

128
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,997
so they go off to a refrigeration chamber

129
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,666
for two minutes to cool.

130
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,204
as the couscous exits the chamber,

131
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,406
it runs through a screening machine

132
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,610
that separates the balls, called "grains," by size.

133
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,878
medium and fine couscous

134
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,813
go off to their respective storage silos,

135
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,150
while grains that are too big or too small

136
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,420
go back to be reprocessed.

137
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,155
the couscous-making process,

138
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,958
from wheat semolina to the finished product,

139
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,161
has taken just 45 minutes.

140
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,428
as we've seen,

141
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,298
most of the cooking's been done by the factory,

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,367
so all the consumer will have to do

143
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,169
is steam this ready-made couscous for five minutes

144
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,806
on the stove or in the microwave.

145
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:43,047
this factory packages its couscous in bulk quantities,

146
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,384
as well as in smaller, meal-sized portions.

147
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:03,068
today, ready-made couscous comes in many different flavors.

148
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,405
and depending on the dish you're making

149
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,307
or your personal preference,

150
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,477
you can choose medium grain...

151
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,512
or fine grain.

152
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,617
plain or flavored couscous

153
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,687
is becoming an increasingly popular side dish,

154
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,759
an alternative to rice, potatoes, or noodles.

155
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,895
you can even buy main-course couscous kits

156
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,431
that come with a can of vegetables

157
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,767
and a packet of sauce.

158
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,510
narrator: there's nothing little kids love more

159
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,315
than digging their hands into a mound of squishy modeling dough,

160
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,851
then rolling and shaping it.

161
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,653
it's a hands-on experience in creativity,

162
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,322
made all the more fun by modeling doughs

163
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,526
that come in bright colors and yummy scents.

164
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,265
just in case little billy

165
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,134
decides to snack on his artistic creation,

166
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,870
this scented modeling dough

167
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,539
is made entirely of food ingredients --

168
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:19,410
flavorings and colorings, salt, flour, hot water,

169
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:24,015
and some secret ingredients the company won't divulge.

170
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,418
the key to achieving just the right consistency

171
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,487
is meticulous measurement.

172
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,458
they use electronic scales to precision-weigh each ingredient.

173
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,899
bit by bit, they pour the dry ingredients

174
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,435
and flavorings into the mixer.

175
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,637
the amount of hot water they add

176
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,775
varies according to the color and scent they're producing.

177
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:56,514
the proportions are about 30% water to 70% dry ingredients.

178
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,584
the last ingredient is food coloring --

179
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,953
in this case, cherry red.

180
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,591
for the modeling dough to come out just right,

181
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,992
the mixing time has to be

182
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,863
precisely 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

183
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,931
when the dough comes out,

184
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,468
it's roughly the consistency of pie dough.

185
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,937
it's quite hot from all that churning,

186
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,941
almost 160 degrees fahrenheit,

187
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:27,412
but there's no need to cool it before packaging.

188
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,415
it goes right into a machine called the stuffer,

189
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,552
which cuts it in container-sized portions.

190
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,166
the finished product is soft and malleable,

191
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,968
enough for endless hours of playing.

192
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,037
besides smelling delightful,

193
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,706
this modeling dough doesn't crumble,

194
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,441
doesn't stick to things,

195
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,178
and won't stain clothes or upholstery.

196
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,451
a machine called the container distributor

197
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,021
lines up the plastic containers.

198
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,200
then the stuffer drops a wad of hot dough into each one.

199
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,874
as the containers move down the line,

200
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,410
on goes a cover stamped with the production date.

201
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,413
a compression roller then runs over the cover

202
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,349
to create an airtight seal.

203
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,554
last but not least,

204
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:47,058
a colorful sticker to boldly identify the scent.

205
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,108
the containers pass through a metal detector,

206
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,576
a precautionary measure

207
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,579
in case some metal shards wore off the machinery

208
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,715
and landed unnoticed in the dough.

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,889
the company lab is continually developing new scents.

210
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:25,730
this brand comes in 36 different scents so far...

211
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,099
from a variety of fruits...

212
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,972
...to kid-friendly foods.

213
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,017
the lab is also constantly experimenting with new colors,

214
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,754
though some, such as purples, are quite difficult to produce.

215
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,691
children, of course, can make their own colors

216
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,960
simply by combining existing ones.

217
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,705
if you leave the modeling dough

218
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:11,175
out of the sealed container for too long, it'll dry out.

219
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,778
but because this brand is water-based,

220
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,646
not oil-based like some others,

221
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,515
you can revive it.

222
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,318
all you have to do is add a few drops of water,

223
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,585
knead it a bit,

224
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,588
then put it back in the sealed container.

225
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,123
after a few hours,

226
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,360
your scented modeling dough will be as good as new.

227
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,539
narrator: wicker is thin branches or vines

228
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,008
flexible enough to be woven.

229
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,210
many plants can be used for wicker,

230
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,480
such as willow and rattan.

231
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,882
quality wicker is very durable.

232
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,285
you can find antique wicker furniture

233
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,323
that's as sturdy today as it was in its heyday.

234
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:10,167
the oldest piece of wicker on record dates back to 1400 b.c.

235
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,971
archeologists discovered it in egypt,

236
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,774
where, in ancient times, people used wicker chairs.

237
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,909
handwoven wicker furniture

238
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:23,181
was the rage in europe and north america in the 1800s.

239
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,649
to meet this demand,

240
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,985
trade schools churned out master wicker weavers.

241
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,056
but by the 1930s, manufacturers
developed a paper fiber

242
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,392
to mimic the look of wicker

243
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:38,429
and large mechanized looms to do the weaving.

244
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:49,807
today's genuine wicker items are usually made of rattan core,

245
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,344
rattan palm-tree branches stripped of their bark

246
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,615
then processed into different diameters and profiles.

247
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,950
at this workshop,

248
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,286
they use a manual loom to weave wicker hampers.

249
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,556
taking what's known as "flat oval rattan core" --

250
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,426
flat on one side, rounded on the other --

251
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,829
they run horizontal strands through vertical strands

252
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,764
in an under-and-over pattern,

253
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,567
working between the hamper's wooden frame

254
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,236
and its fiberboard lining.

255
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,905
they keep the vertical strands taut

256
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,175
by tying them to weighted ropes.

257
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,309
it's important

258
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,645
to keep moistening the rattan with hot water

259
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,148
to keep it supple enough to manipulate.

260
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,919
they weave one thin round strand

261
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,322
after every 5-inch-high section
of flat oval.

262
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,659
there's no structural reason for this pattern --

263
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,062
it's purely aesthetic.

264
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:50,001
a wicker wastebasket begins with
a base that dictates the shape.

265
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,337
they insert vertical stakes of round rattan core

266
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,739
along its perimeter, then below the base,

267
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,077
bend each stake over the next, then under the one after that.

268
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,147
this forms what's called the foot border,

269
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:08,886
a bottom rim that holds the base securely in place.

270
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:13,357
now they insert a wooden form and begin weaving.

271
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,426
first, a small section of round rows,

272
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,697
then a large section of flat oval ones.

273
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,101
slowly and patiently, they work their way to the top,

274
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,636
never resorting to glue or staples

275
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,505
to hold the strands together,

276
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:31,909
only a hook to compress the rows
for a neat and tight weave.

277
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:36,914
every so often, they use pliers
to tear off a stray fiber.

278
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,582
now for the finishing touch.

279
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,319
they braid what's left of the vertical stakes

280
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,321
into a decorative top rim.

281
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,725
this particular braiding technique is very complex,

282
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,594
requiring all 10 fingers and a special tool

283
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,232
to pry stubborn strands apart.

284
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,969
they snip off the excess with a cutter.

285
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,474
when they're finished, they remove the modular wooden form.

286
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,410
its components are numbered,

287
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,679
so they'll know how to reassemble them

288
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,780
for the next basket.

289
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,554
another more decorative way to finish the top of the basket

290
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,756
is this arch technique.

291
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:23,293
they trim each vertical stake, bend it into an arch,

292
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,864
then tuck it into the basket three stakes over.

293
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:34,638
this measuring tool ensures the arches are of equal height,

294
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,174
while this metal device creates a space

295
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,010
into which to tuck each stake.

296
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,717
wicker weavers create magnificent designs

297
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,521
by combining various shapes and sizes of rattan.

298
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:55,793
a strand can be as thick as a pencil or as thin as a needle.

299
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,864
while this doesn't quite fall under the category of wicker,

300
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,399
it's not uncommon to see wicker workshops

301
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,535
use other natural materials.

302
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,940
here, they're weaving a chair seat

303
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,476
out of cord made from sea grass.

304
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,891
there's also wicker seating material.

305
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,494
this prewoven sheet is called "cane seating,"

306
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,496
or "rattan peel."

307
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,833
it's made from the bark stripped off the rattan branch.

308
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,636
first, they force it into a groove

309
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,438
in the chair's wooden frame,

310
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,307
then they glue in what's called "spline,"

311
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,176
a strip of rattan core with a pointed edge.

312
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,512
they wedge that edge into the groove

313
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,915
and bring it down to the hold the rattan peel in place.

314
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,552
then they trim off the excess.

315
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,525
because wicker is wood,

316
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:06,530
it can be stained or painted or left its natural color.

317
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:07,998
whatever the finish,

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,401
they give it two or three coats
of varnish for protection.
