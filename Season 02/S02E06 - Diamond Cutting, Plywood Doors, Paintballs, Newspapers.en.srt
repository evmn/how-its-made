narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,360
...diamond cutting...

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,029
wood doors...

6
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,830
paintballs...

7
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,399
and newspapers.

8
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:41,373
diamonds are rare crystals composed mostly of carbon.

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,376
they're the hardest natural substance on earth.

10
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,244
a superb cut manipulates light

11
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,580
to maximize a stone's brilliance.

12
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,217
that enhances the diamond's beauty and increases its value.

13
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,990
diamonds come in a variety of colors,

14
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,193
the most common of which for jewelry is white.

15
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,929
they begin as a larger, rough stone.

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,332
the goal is to cut as big a diamond as possible from it

17
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,667
while cutting away any imperfections

18
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,470
that lessen the value.

19
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:14,739
to do this precision work, master diamond cutters

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,544
use a magnifying glass that enlarges the stone 10 times.

21
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,213
they carefully examine and re-examine the rough diamond,

22
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:26,151
trying to determine the best way
to divide the stone.

23
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:30,021
they must saw the diamond in the direction of its grain,

24
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,624
then, using hot glue,

25
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,093
secure the rough diamond into a holder

26
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,030
positioned over the saw.

27
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,700
the saw has a very fine bronze blade,

28
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,703
but it can't cut through the diamond on its own.

29
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,972
only diamond can cut diamond,

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:51,042
so they coat the blade in a mixture of diamond dust and oil.

31
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,246
sawing an average-size rough diamond in two

32
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,782
can take up to four hours.

33
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,919
the second stage of diamond cutting is called polishing.

34
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,789
it's the process of forming the diamond.

35
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,325
a special machine first tailors the basic shape.

36
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,729
then the diamond cutter puts glue in a mounting tool

37
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,930
called a dop.

38
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,000
this will hold the diamond firmly in place.

39
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:19,238
he presses the diamond against a spinning cast-iron wheel

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,407
coated with a mixture of diamond dust and oil.

41
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,077
first, he removes any marks that were left by the saw.

42
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,480
then, to give the stone its brilliance,

43
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,015
he forms facets --

44
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:34,620
a particular pattern of tiny, flat sides of various shapes.

45
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:38,289
the facets are designed to reflect light off each other.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,628
each one must be exactly the right size and shape and cut

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,098
at precisely the right angle in relation to the other facets

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,167
to create maximum brilliance.

49
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,103
here he starts with the table facet,

50
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,140
which is the flat top of the diamond.

51
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,710
how he proceeds

52
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,281
depends on the size and condition of the stone.

53
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,718
then come the pavilions --

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,788
the angled facets that end in a point

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,123
at the bottom of the diamond.

56
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,260
if they're cut too deep or too shallow,

57
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,262
light will leak out the bottom,

58
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,500
making the diamond dark in the center and dull overall.

59
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:28,072
the ideal slope is approximately 42 degrees.

60
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,542
the diamond cutter uses specialized tools

61
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,843
to measure the angle.

62
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,831
next, the diamond cutter fashions crown facets --

63
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,469
the ones circling the diamond directly under the table.

64
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,114
using another type of dop,

65
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,317
the diamond cutter fashions what's called the girdle --

66
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,586
the faceted rim that separates the crown facets

67
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,455
around the top half of the diamond

68
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,625
and the pavilion facets below.

69
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,131
diamonds are weighed using a measurement called karats.

70
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,668
one karat weighs 0.007 ounces.

71
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,338
polishing a one-karat diamond can take three or four hours.

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,842
when it's done, they boil it in acid to remove any debris.

73
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,882
this finished diamond has 58 facets.

74
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,084
it's called a brilliant cut.

75
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,754
it's by far the most common style of cut,

76
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,323
dating back to the 1600s.

77
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,765
the quality of the cut

78
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,235
is a key factor in grading diamonds.

79
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,172
experts also rate what's called the clarity --

80
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,640
the degree of imperfections in the stone.

81
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,576
then there's color.

82
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,913
the finest white diamonds are completely colorless,

83
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,350
and the rarest colors are the most valuable.

84
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,530
narrator: coming soon to a supermarket near you --

85
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,065
food that tells you when it's gone bad.

86
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,935
researchers are developing electronic devices

87
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,536
that monitor food freshness

88
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,341
and detect potentially fatal bacteria like e. coli.

89
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,076
these devices on the packaging

90
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:48,113
would give off a signal when the food inside spoils.

91
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,354
we open and close them several times a day,

92
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,889
day in and day out

93
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,957
and seldom give them a second thought,

94
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,494
but imagine your home without doors.

95
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,564
for one thing, you'd have absolutely no privacy.

96
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,767
and what would you slam when you get angry?

97
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:15,173
the first factory makes the door's plywood facing.

98
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,311
they start by loading logs into
steaming basins for three days.

99
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:23,782
this deices them in the winter and softens the wood fiber.

100
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:28,453
inside the factory, the steamed logs line up for the debarker --

101
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,655
a machine that removes the bark.

102
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,458
the operator projects concentric circles

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,529
and uses a laser to carefully center the log on the debarker.

104
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:40,165
positioning is crucial for two reasons --

105
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,266
so that as little wood as possible

106
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,734
comes off with the bark

107
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,873
and to ensure the debarked log ends up perfectly cylindrical.

108
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,343
that maximizes the amount of wood veneer a log will yield.

109
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,413
the next step is called rotary cutting.

110
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,618
as the log spins, a lathe skims off a sheet of wood veneer

111
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,486
just 2/100 of an inch thick.

112
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:06,625
the average log yields 440 linear feet of veneer.

113
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,066
next, they unroll the veneer and cut it into sheets.

114
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,575
then they stack the sheets by identical grain patterns.

115
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,111
using a laser to position the blade,

116
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,514
they cut through the stack to take out visual defects.

117
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,852
then they glue the pieces together.

118
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,986
to make veneer sheets

119
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,055
for the front of the plywood facing,

120
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,389
the side that will show,

121
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,124
they line up the wood's grain

122
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,261
and other features in mirror image.

123
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,597
for the back, the side that won't show,

124
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,666
they assemble the defective parts they cut out earlier.

125
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,804
they use three veneer sheets to make up the plywood door facing.

126
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,874
they apply glue to both sides of one sheet,

127
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,310
then sandwich it between two other sheets.

128
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,353
they feed the three sheets through a hot press

129
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,289
at more than 212 degrees fahrenheit.

130
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,359
in a minute and a half, the glue cures,

131
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,897
and those three sheets of veneer
become a 3-ply panel of plywood.

132
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,633
then they sand the panel.

133
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,503
plywood door facings can be made

134
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,305
from more than 15 different species of wood

135
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,575
from birch and oak to maple and mahogany.

136
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:35,113
at the second factory, they make the core of the door.

137
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,250
they glue together strips of wood to form the middle,

138
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,785
then frame them with pieces of white pine.

139
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,457
a press pushes the core pieces together,

140
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,460
then activates the glue,

141
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:52,130
not by heat as most presses do,
but by microwaves.

142
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,037
next, they sand and calibrate the core.

143
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,011
after the glue machine coats the core,

144
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,315
they stick a plywood door facing
on each side.

145
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,365
they stack a few doors at a time into a cold press

146
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,435
for a half-hour. until the glue dries,

147
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,904
then set them aside while the glue cures

148
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,873
for another eight hours.

149
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,984
next, they size the width and length to the final dimension,

150
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,185
bevel the edges,

151
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,589
and cut the exact height of the door.

152
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,858
then they inspect the door on both sides.

153
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,969
a machine prepares the door for hinges.

154
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,043
then another machine cuts the hole for the knob.

155
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,092
the finishing process takes just 70 seconds per door.

156
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,560
one side is sanded, stained, and sealed,

157
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,097
then sanded again and varnished.

158
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,231
the machine then flips the door over

159
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,335
and does the same thing to the other side.

160
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,577
narrator: the game of paintball

161
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,980
is a cross between tag, hide-and-seek,

162
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,581
and capture the flag.

163
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,917
you try to steal the other team's flag

164
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,186
and eliminate your opponents with an air gun

165
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,923
that shoots an exploding paint capsule called a paintball.

166
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:06,864
paintballs are made entirely of nontoxic food-grade ingredients.

167
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,333
to make the hollow shell,

168
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,137
they first pour water into a giant, heated mixing bowl.

169
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,472
they add a sweetener and a secret combination

170
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,408
of food ingredients the company won't divulge.

171
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,544
then, finally, the key ingredient

172
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,813
that gives the shell its shape -- gelatin --

173
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,617
the kind used to make gummy bears.

174
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,754
they melt and mix everything for a half an hour...

175
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,161
...then line it up for what they call the drop --

176
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,563
transferring the gel from the mixer

177
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,933
into a heated vat called the gel tote.

178
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,006
they filter out any globs that didn't melt.

179
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,855
once the gel is securely in the tote,

180
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,392
they lower in a giant blender.

181
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,871
they pour in food dye and blend for about 20 minutes.

182
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,363
elsewhere in the factory,

183
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,432
they use the same method to dye
what's called the fill --

184
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,769
the paint that goes inside the shell of the paintball.

185
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,105
it's made of polyethylene glycol --

186
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,441
the inert liquid in cough syrup.

187
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,742
they thicken it with crayon wax.

188
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,845
the gel and fill meet their maker

189
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,581
in what's known as the feed room.

190
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,384
here, the vats of gel and fill

191
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,320
feed a capsulation machine one floor below.

192
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,190
this machine is the same kind

193
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,394
used to make bath beads and gelcap medicine.

194
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,797
first, the machine spreads out the gel onto a cool drum.

195
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,801
this creates a continuous thin sheet of gel

196
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,202
called a gel ribbon.

197
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,338
this cooling cures the gelatin

198
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,674
to the point where it can now be molded

199
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,811
into the hollow shell of the ball.

200
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:37,015
the machine presses the gel ribbon into a dye

201
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,483
with half-circle pockets,

202
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,285
each forming one half of a ball shell.

203
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,488
the machine does the next three steps in one shot.

204
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,292
it aligns the two half shells together to form a hollow ball,

205
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,497
injects the fill, then seals the two half shells together.

206
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,178
these newly minted paintballs are still quite soft, though.

207
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,782
if they're not dried out, they'll lose their shape,

208
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,551
so they fall down onto a conveyor...

209
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,655
...then roll into a tumble dryer.

210
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,798
from here, they'll go onto a bakery-style rack

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,801
until they dry out completely.

212
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:38,542
to make dual-colored paintballs,
they use the exact same process

213
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,745
but feed two colors of gel ribbon

214
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,614
into the capsulation machine --

215
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,383
one color for each half of the shell.

216
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,827
the finished paintballs

217
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,297
go through an automatic counting machine.

218
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,835
this one is set to count out and package 200 balls at a time.

219
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:07,038
manufacturing this messy ammunition

220
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,306
is a painstaking process,

221
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,109
but well worth the effort

222
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,911
to the millions who love the game of paintball.

223
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,314
invented just 15 years ago,

224
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,984
it's caught on in more than 40 countries worldwide,

225
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,919
and it's not just for kids.

226
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,922
more and more companies are booking paintball outings

227
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,492
for their employees to help build teamwork.

228
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,535
narrator: there was a time when our only source of news

229
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,937
was the newspaper.

230
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,073
today, though, newspapers have to compete

231
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,942
with radio, television, and the internet.

232
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,212
still, to get context and analysis of news events,

233
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,248
most still turn to the newspaper.

234
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:00,290
in medieval times, people got the news of the kingdom

235
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,893
from the town crier

236
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:06,030
and from official notices posted in public places.

237
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,433
by the late 1400s,

238
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,969
the first printed news pamphlets
appeared in germany.

239
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,772
the first english-language newspaper

240
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:19,444
hit the stands in london in 1622.

241
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,313
by the 1800s, new printing technology

242
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,716
brought the price of newspapers down.

243
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,852
this finally made them affordable to the masses,

244
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,822
who were becoming more literate.

245
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,266
the news editor selects the stories and photographs.

246
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:46,003
they come from the newspaper's own reporters and photographers

247
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,938
and from wire services.

248
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,076
the news editor accesses the wire services via the internet.

249
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,611
local reporters file their stories

250
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,447
to the newsroom computer system.

251
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,283
the photo lab scans the photographers' pictures

252
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,951
into the system as well.

253
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,088
that puts everything at the news editor's fingertips.

254
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,757
it's just a matter of moving the various items

255
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,293
into the page layout.

256
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,162
once the layout's complete,

257
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,231
they group the pages in sets of four called flats.

258
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,901
the manager checks each flat for errors,

259
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,703
paying special attention to the advertisements,

260
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,706
the newspaper's main source of revenue.

261
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,377
next, they prepare the printing plates for each page.

262
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,380
a plate is a plastic-coated sheet of aluminum,

263
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,916
just 1/100 of an inch thick.

264
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:35,052
it goes into the cylinder of a machine called the imager.

265
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,322
the imager's laser beam scans the plate,

266
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,257
hardening the plastic coating

267
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,661
wherever the computer tells it there will be text or pictures.

268
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,330
the coating in the blank areas that don't harden

269
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,633
then washes away in a series of chemical baths.

270
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,603
it takes about a minute for a plate

271
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,073
to pass through those processing basins.

272
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,277
next, a machine punches registration marks

273
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,079
on each side of the plate.

274
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,215
the press operators will use those marks as a guide

275
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,151
to correctly position the plate
on the printing press.

276
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:11,889
after they oil the press cylinder,

277
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,558
they attach the plates.

278
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,227
there's one plate per page per color

279
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,963
to a maximum of four colors.

280
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,369
the newsprint comes in jumbo rolls

281
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,706
weighing about 1,900 pounds apiece.

282
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,251
workers feed several rolls

283
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,387
into the reeling machine under the printing press.

284
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,524
2-sided tape connects one roll to the next,

285
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,694
ensuring a continuous, uninterrupted run.

286
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,135
this is a 4-color printing process.

287
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,937
there's a station for each color of ink.

288
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,273
the paper passes through each color one at a time

289
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,410
like a car going through an automatic car wash.

290
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,016
the printing starts out slowly,

291
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,753
but within a few seconds revs up
to 25 miles per hour.

292
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,861
press operators adjust the colors as needed.

293
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,199
each line of the press prints a 4-page flat.

294
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,668
then it cuts the sheet in half lengthwise,

295
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,771
separating two and two.

296
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,080
then it cuts the continuous lengths widthwise

297
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,882
into a 2-page spread.

298
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,020
machines automatically assemble the pages in order,

299
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,489
then send them off to the shipping department.

300
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:44,108
the stacker makes piles of 50 copies for delivery.

301
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,754
then workers hand-stuff the inserts one by one.

302
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,134
if you have any comments about the show,

303
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,871
or if you'd like to suggest topics for future shows,
