00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,491
            narrator:           
    today on "how it's made,"   

4
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,359
      firefighter boots...      

5
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,165
       ...garden tools...       

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,737
    ...automated machines...    

7
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,576
      ...and gypsum board.      

8
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:55,654
     firefighters need boots    
 they can pull on lightning fast

9
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,390
       to get to the blaze      
     as quickly as possible.    

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,661
     those boots have to be     
 fire-resistant and waterproof. 

11
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,531
 they have to provide good grip 
      for climbing ladders      

12
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,732
      and be sturdy enough      
         not to puncture        

13
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,302
          when stepping         
      through sharp debris.     

14
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:18,077
  firefighter boots start out   
  as a chunky block of rubber.  

15
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,949
    the first step is to put    
    the block through a mill.   

16
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,753
  it passes through the rollers 
       over and over again      

17
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,056
   until it gradually flattens  
         and thins out.         

18
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,561
  workers then add chemicals -- 

19
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,964
     anywhere from 15 to 35     
       different types --       

20
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,233
 depending on the model of boot 
         they're making.        

21
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:45,504
 the rubber formulation is what 
 makes the boot fire-resistant. 

22
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,442
         once the rubber        
    is smooth and malleable,    

23
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,911
      about the consistency     
       of modeling dough,       

24
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,647
    they form it into sheets    
     from which they'll cut     

25
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,183
       the various pieces       
     that make up the boot.     

26
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,652
      they feed this sheet      
         through rollers        

27
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,588
   that imprint vertical lines  
         on the rubber.         

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,458
      they'll cut the sheet     
        along these lines       

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,061
to make the strips that run down
      the back of the boot.     

30
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,532
  from another sheet of rubber, 
      using a handheld die,     

31
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,802
       they cut one layer       
    of the multilayered sole.   

32
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,472
  they run an extra-thick sheet 
            of rubber           

33
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,809
         through rollers        
  that imprint a tread pattern. 

34
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,446
      then workers cut out      
        the bottom soles.       

35
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,625
     they mark the boot size    
         on the bottom.         

36
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:44,429
 using yellow rubber, they cut  
 out the boot's toe-cap covers. 

37
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,566
         the boot's leg         
       has a stiff lining       

38
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,235
  to prevent it from wobbling.  

39
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,905
       workers cut it from      
  a rubber-backed cotton fabric 

40
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,440
      following a pattern.      

41
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,242
  once all the pieces are cut,  

42
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,978
  workers can assemble the boot 
           on a form.           

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,715
  they start with the lining,   
  wrapping it around the front  

44
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,251
      and gluing it closed      
          at the back.          

45
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,387
  then they glue on the insole. 

46
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,923
    for this model, it's made   
     of rubber-backed felt.     

47
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,926
   they secure the lining seam  

48
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,230
  and seal it with one of those 
  rubber strips we saw earlier. 

49
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,934
         now the van --         

50
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,538
   a piece of felt reinforced   
  with a thin layer of rubber.  

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,541
  this gives the boot strength. 

52
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:33,945
     next, a toe-cap sponge     
    made of rubber compounds.   

53
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,480
    when they cure the boot,    

54
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,084
the sponge will inflate and hold
   the steel toe cap in place.  

55
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,755
           to protect           
     the firefighter's feet     

56
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,757
          when walking          
      through sharp debris,     

57
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,627
      they add a steel arch     
        and a steel sole.       

58
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,364
    next, an adhesive-backed    
         toe-cap cover.         

59
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:59,104
then a felt sole to protect the 
firefighter's foot against heat.

60
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,306
       it has a steel arch      
         for stability,         

61
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,576
   useful when the firefighter  
    needs to climb a ladder.    

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,112
         after applying         
  a rubber heel-reinforcement,  

63
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,781
    they cover the lower part   
           of the boot          

64
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,984
with yellow foam for insulation.

65
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,725
         they secure it         
    using a strip of rubber.    

66
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:24,529
   now they finish the bottom   
  of the boot in black rubber.  

67
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:30,068
     they reinforce the back    
  and sides in yellow rubber... 

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,472
       and finish them off      
        in black rubber.        

69
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,882
next comes the yellow toe cap...

70
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,152
        then a rubber pad       
to protect the front of the boot

71
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,622
      when it rubs against      
    the rungs of the ladder.    

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,492
      now the bottom sole.      

73
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,096
        they use a press        
      to seal it in place.      

74
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,833
     rubber bonds to rubber     
         under pressure.        

75
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,036
    they apply a rubber trim    
        around the bottom       

76
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,839
      using a small roller      
      to press it in place.     

77
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,710
workers then press all the seams
to ensure they're well-adhered. 

78
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,781
 then it's into a vacuum machine
     for about four seconds     

79
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,317
   to create an airtight bond.  

80
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,054
            finally,            
 the boots go into a giant oven 

81
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,124
         that heats them        
   to 280-degrees fahrenheit.   

82
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:31,797
  an hour and 45 minutes later, 
the rubber is cured and hardened

83
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,399
       and all the pieces       
      have fused together.      

84
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:38,136
           these boots          
   are ready to take the heat.  

85
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,348
  narrator: anyone with a green 
    thumb knows that it takes   

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,818
     both skill and patience    
   to make a garden flourish.   

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,422
      it also helps to have     
    the proper tools on hand.   

88
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,758
   an avid gardener's arsenal   
     can contain everything     

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,094
     from shears, trimmers,     
           and pruners          

90
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,865
   to rakes, hoes, and spades.  

91
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,505
  the handles of these garden   
  tools are made of white ash,  

92
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,306
          a sturdy wood         
  that can withstand the force  

93
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,975
     of shoveling, digging,     
           or raking.           

94
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,514
     these dried-ash dowels     
 measure two to seven feet long,

95
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,049
      depending on the tool     
           being made.          

96
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,853
        they first enter        
what's called the chucking line,

97
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,589
    where specially designed,   
       automated machines       

98
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,858
    shape them into handles.    

99
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,327
       the first operation      
        rounds the dowels       

100
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,062
   to the required diameter --  

101
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,599
        about two inches,       
     depending on the tool.     

102
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,469
   the next operation cuts the  
  dowels to the required length 

103
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,005
    and profiles their ends.    

104
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,082
       two chucking heads,      
        one on each side,       

105
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,418
 carve the ends simultaneously. 

106
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,222
  one shapes the bottom of the  
 handle to fit the tool's blade.

107
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,025
         certain blades         
   go over the wooden handle,   

108
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,893
    while others go into it.    

109
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,363
      for inserted blades,      

110
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,298
      another chucking head     
     hollows out the handle.    

111
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,168
  meanwhile, the chucking head  
        on the other side       

112
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,370
           rounds off           
     the top of the handle.     

113
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,308
      the finished handles      
   spin against a sanding belt  

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,511
 as they exit the chucking line.

115
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,713
          this smoothes         
    the surface of the wood,    

116
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:33,384
    preparing the handles for   
  a coat of protective varnish. 

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:37,923
high-end shovels and spades have
what's called a steel d-grip -- 

118
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,792
       a steel handle grip      
      with a wooden insert.     

119
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,929
       an automated lathe       
   first shapes a piece of ash  

120
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,065
to the right length and profile.

121
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,435
     then an automated drill    
         pierces a hole.        

122
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,874
 to make the sides of the grip, 

123
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:01,279
 workers begin with two precut  
 pieces of steel called blanks. 

124
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,549
         they place them        
  in a manually operated press  

125
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,553
        that shapes them        
     in a two-step process.     

126
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,023
        they use the heat       
 of a strong electrical current 

127
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,293
        to melt the steel       
  and fuse the pieces together. 

128
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:19,430
         this is called         
       resistance welding.      

129
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,766
  next, they feed a steel rivet 

130
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,269
        through the sides       
      and wooden insert...      

131
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,107
          ...and fasten         
      everything together.      

132
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,647
    elsewhere in the factory,   
    a heated forming machine    

133
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,784
 stamps out the steel blanks the
 workers will shape into blades.

134
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,861
          a robotic arm         
 loads the blanks into an oven. 

135
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,937
      in just four minutes,     

136
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:03,575
the oven heats the steel to over
    1,800-degrees fahrenheit.   

137
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,122
        this intense heat       
   makes the metal malleable.   

138
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:26,564
      workers then take out     
 and shape one blank at a time. 

139
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,633
  they only have a few seconds  

140
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,902
        to form the steel       
      before it cools off.      

141
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,175
         the first press        
       forms the blade --       

142
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,244
      in this case a shovel     
      and a partial socket.     

143
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,982
      then the second press     
       closes the socket.       

144
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,918
 they quickly submerge the blade
        in lukewarm water       

145
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,120
     to cool the metal down.    

146
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,790
        by now, the steel       
      is extremely brittle,     

147
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,526
  so the blades go into what's  
   called a tempering furnace   

148
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,062
         for 15 minutes.        

149
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,664
           this alters          
 the metal's internal structure,

150
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,799
     restoring its strength.    

151
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,936
        the steel d-grip        
  has been cleaned and painted. 

152
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,808
workers insert the wooden handle
  and nail the parts together.  

153
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,278
        on the other end,       
     they attach the blade,     

154
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,149
     which, by now, has been    
 varnished to prevent corrosion.

155
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,552
  after drilling a hole through 
  both the metal and the wood,  

156
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,356
   they fasten the blade using  
a rivet if it's a high-end tool,

157
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,026
 a nail if it's a budget model. 

158
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,695
     these hot-off-the-press    
          garden tools          

159
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,699
        are finally ready       
  to put in a hard day's work.  

160
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:46,645
narrator: a couple of centuries 
after the industrial revolution,

161
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,514
         mass production        
        met automation --       

162
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:54,319
   a match made not in heaven   
     but in high technology.    

163
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,986
    in this special segment,    

164
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,124
     "how it's made" honors     
     the automated machine      

165
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,359
   with this "moving" tribute.  

166
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,539
      narrator: it's called     
  "gypsum board" or "drywall,"  

167
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,476
   and chances are your walls   
  and ceilings are made of it.  

168
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:50,614
 years ago, it replaced plaster 
 as the wall material of choice.

169
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,684
  workers just mount the sheets 
       onto wood framing,       

170
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,522
      plaster the joints,       
      then sand and paint.      

171
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,163
  gypsum is a natural mineral.  

172
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,901
since ancient times, it has been
mined to produce gypsum plaster.

173
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:15,173
 in fact, there's gypsum plaster
      in egypt's pyramids.      

174
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,976
   in 1894, a man by the name   
      of augustine sackett      

175
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,981
patented a board made of gypsum,
which he called "plasterboard." 

176
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,417
  but it didn't become the norm 
         in construction        

177
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,121
     until the building boom    
   that followed world war ii,  

178
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,057
      when busy contractors     
        abandoned plaster       

179
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,762
     in favor of this faster    
 and cheaper way to build walls.

180
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,473
  the process of making gypsum  
  board begins at the quarry,   

181
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,411
  where crews mine the gypsum,  
          a soft rock.          

182
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:57,214
  the loaders dump their haul   
  into what's called an apron.  

183
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,351
  the apron channels the gypsum 
        onto a conveyor,        

184
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,754
   breaking up the big chunks   
         along the way.         

185
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,358
      from there, it's sent     
    to a giant rotating drum.   

186
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,759
        within 8 minutes,       

187
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:13,097
 this hot-air rock dryer removes
   5% to 10% of the moisture,   

188
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,033
    turning the gypsum white.   

189
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,303
  next stop, a gas-fired silo,  
        called a kettle.        

190
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:23,908
       it cooks the gypsum      
   at 300 degrees fahrenheit,   

191
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,577
   until most of the remaining  
      moisture evaporates.      

192
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,579
   the kettle is fed by a mill  

193
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:32,517
   that grinds the lumpy rock   
  into what's called "stucco,"  

194
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,586
  a fine powder the consistency 
         of wheat flour.        

195
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,191
        in a mixing tank,       
      workers combine water     

196
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,526
 with several powdered chemicals
          and minerals          

197
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,329
      and a chemical soap.      

198
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:49,066
the dry additives give the board
     the required structure,    

199
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,469
     while the soap creates     
           air bubbles          

200
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,404
   to make the board lighter.   

201
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,942
 in a separate machine, they mix
 the stucco with an accelerator 

202
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:02,146
 to make the gypsum set faster. 

203
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,515
        now they combine        
    the two separate batches,   

204
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,284
       creating a mixture       
        called a slurry.        

205
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,353
it looks like thick, white soup.

206
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,089
       now they'll form it      
       into gypsum board,       

207
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,758
       which is basically       
       a slurry sandwich.       

208
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,829
    the bread is this thick,    
       heavyweight paper.       

209
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,899
  as the roll unwinds, "creaser 
   wheels," as they're called,  

210
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,568
   score a line about one inch  
        toward the middle       

211
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,238
        from both edges.        

212
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,573
  then a machine evenly spreads 
           the slurry,          

213
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,974
    like a sandwich filling,    

214
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,544
   between the top and bottom   
        sheets of paper.        

215
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,048
     then the paper-folding     
        operation begins,       

216
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,184
          most of which         
       is a company secret      

217
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,852
 and off-limits to our cameras. 

218
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,456
       they fold the edges      
      along the scorelines,     

219
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,659
     the bottom edges upward    
   and the top ones downward,   

220
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,396
gluing them over the bottom ones
   to trap the slurry inside.   

221
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,933
    drops of water smooth out   
           any ridges,          

222
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:00,004
ensuring a smooth and even fold.

223
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,473
    forming plates then shape   
        the folded edges        

224
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,942
      into straight sides.      

225
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:12,216
    an optical sensor checks    
the depth of the board's recess.

226
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,418
   the recess is where you put  
         the joint tape         

227
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,355
to connect one board to the next
  when you're building a wall.  

228
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,694
  the forming station spews out 
      1,000 continuous feet     

229
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,230
        of gypsum board.        

230
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,566
       a cutter now chops       
         that megaboard         

231
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,636
       into whatever size       
 they're producing in this run. 

232
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,374
 as the boards exit the cutter, 

233
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,578
   automated prongs flip them   
         recess-side up.        

234
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,048
     the recess side will be    
        the wall surface,       

235
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,317
   and they don't want to risk  
           damaging it          

236
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,153
    on the rollers that lead    
     to the drying station.     

237
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,793
  this gas-fired hot-air dryer  

238
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,396
         is kind of like        
  a multilevel parking garage.  

239
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:05,002
    it's almost 500 feet long   
        and has 8 decks.        

240
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:09,740
  the factory can cure hundreds 
      of boards at a time.      

241
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,074
       it takes 40 minutes      

242
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,744
   to move through the dryer's  
      4 temperature zones,      

243
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,014
           which start          
    at 660 degrees fahrenheit   

244
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:20,918
  and get progressively cooler, 
         to 300 degrees.        

245
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,889
  the boards are sold in pairs, 

246
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,826
 so the machinery stacks them in
 twos, then tapes them together.

247

248
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,032
       as well as the size

   and there's fire-resistant   
          gypsum board,
