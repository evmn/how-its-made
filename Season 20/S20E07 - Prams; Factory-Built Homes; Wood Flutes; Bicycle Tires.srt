00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,986
            narrator:           
     the best way to protect    
   your bicycle against theft   

4
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,388
      is a heavy-duty lock.     

5
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,924
           a u-lock is          
     the most secure option.    

6
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,992
  unlike a cable or chain lock, 

7
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:03,662
you can't quickly sever a u-lock
  with a pair of bolt cutters.  

8
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,932
            it takes            
   large conspicuous tools --   

9
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,468
not something a thief can likely
    get away with unobserved.   

10
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:15,875
  u-locks come in various sizes 

11
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,411
 so that you can lock your bike 
     to different structures    

12
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:22,080
      from thin bike racks      
     to thicker tree trunks.    

13
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,686
  the shackle and lock are made 
  of hardened high-alloy steel, 

14
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:30,356
 which is resistant to cutting, 
      sawing, and twisting.     

15
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:33,693
      to shape the shackle,     
     workers load steel bars    

16
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:36,696
     into a computer-guided     
        bending machine.        

17
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,769
       the machine applies      
   more than 25 tons of force   

18
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,405
         to bend the bar        
     in the shape of a "u".     

19
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,319
    the machine also notches    
    each end of the shackle.    

20
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,990
 these notches are what receive 
       the locking bolts.       

21
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,526
  to make the steel hard enough 
       to be tamper-proof,      

22
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,795
     they send the shackle      
     to an outside facility     

23
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,063
       for heat treatment.      

24
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,733
  this demonstration re-creates 
          a small part          

25
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:17,069
    of that complex process,    
  which is to heat the shackle  

26
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,405
            to almost           
    1,500 degrees fahrenheit    

27
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,807
          to rearrange          
    the molecular structure,    

28
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,942
         cool it in oil         

29
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:25,611
       to set the hardness      
     of that rearrangement,     

30
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,879
           then reheat          
     at moderate temperature    

31
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,282
   to restore the flexibility   
         the steel lost         

32
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,551
   due to the previous steps.   

33
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,022
    when the shackle returns    
         to the factory,        

34
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,889
         a laser machine        
       precision measures       

35
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,092
       and, if necessary,       
     corrects the dimensions    

36
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,228
     as per specifications.     

37
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,399
   then the shackle is dipped   
in durable anti-corrosion paint.

38
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,436
      once the paint dries,     

39
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:54,106
  and automated machine slips   
  a pvc tube over the shackle.  

40
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,586
        next, they screw        
        a plastic bracket       

41
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,789
   to one end of the shackle.   

42
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,724
          this connects         
   to a corresponding bracket   

43
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,058
  you screw to your bike frame  

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,994
  to mount the lock on the bike 
      when you're cycling.      

45
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,997
      the rectangular block     
 that houses the locking system 

46
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,332
    is called the lock body.    

47
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,401
            it, too,            
   is made of hardened steel.   

48
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,005
an automated press punches holes
   on the ends for the shackle  

49
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,142
        and in the middle       
     for the lock cylinder.     

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,813
the locking system has a housing
in the center for the cylinder. 

51
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,415
 workers mount two metal plates 
            over it.            

52
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,551
         when you insert        
     the security-coded key     

53
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,886
    in the cylinder and turn,   

54
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,756
      the cylinder rotates      
       within the housing       

55
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,357
   and the plates move apart,   

56
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,961
   triggering other components  
  to lock the inserted shackle. 

57
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:53,098
 the cylinder is made of brass, 
    a relatively soft metal,    

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,967
   so there's an impenetrable   
       steel plate on top       

59
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,637
       to prevent a thief       
     from drilling into it.     

60
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,441
    workers give the cylinder   
  grooves a squirt of grease -- 

61
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,376
     the housing, as well --    

62
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,247
        then insert pins        
        into the grooves.       

63
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,515
     these act as blockers,     

64
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:12,117
    preventing the wrong key    
     from opening the lock.     

65
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,854
      with the correct key,     
         they give way,         

66
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:18,390
 enabling the cylinder to rotate
       within the housing.      

67
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,992
   this spring applies tension  

68
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,728
     to the cylinder's steel    
       and drilling plate,      

69
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,330
     keeping it in position     

70
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,466
     so that the key inserts    
    easily into the cylinder.   

71
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,870
  on each side, workers insert  
        a lever and bolt.       

72
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,938
      when you turn the key     
     to the locked position,    

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,341
    the lever pushes the bolt   
    into the shackle's notch,   

74
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,943
    immobilizing the shackle.   

75
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,879
   this component spring-loads  
            the bolt            

76
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,714
 to prevent the inserted shackle
        from popping out        

77
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,750
     prior to being locked.     

78
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,219
   a pneumatic machine inserts  
       the locking system       

79
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,021
    into the steel lock body.   

80
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,025
 a two-tone plastic cover gives 
 the u-lock a snazzy appearance 

81
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:57,296
  and makes the surface easier  
    for the cyclist to grip.    

82
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,031
   here's how the lock works.   

83
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,234
     when you turn the key,     
     the cylinder rotates.      

84
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,037
    this moves the two plates   
        over it outward,        

85
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,306
      triggering the levers     
          on each side          

86
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,775
        to hold the bolt        
      in the shackle notch,     

87
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,776
  locking the shackle in place. 

88
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,847
      every lock undergoes      
  an opening and closing check. 

89
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,649
  random samples are subjected  

90
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,451
        to more extensive       
    quality-control testing.    

91
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,788
   it takes 13 tons of cutting  
   force to break the steel --  

92
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,191
     far more than even this    
 larger-than-typical bolt cutter

93
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,659
           can apply.           

94
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,195
     this torsioning machine    
   measures how much twisting   

95
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,464
    the u-lock can withstand.   

96
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,866
          a bike-robber         
       would have to apply      

97
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,469
      more than 350 pounds      
    of force with a crowbar.    

98
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:41,907
  the bike owner, on the other  
 hand, needs only the coded key.

99
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:56,155
            narrator:           
 the native north american tepee

100
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:59,425
    was designed to be a home   
    where the buffalo roamed.   

101
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,826
         centuries ago,         

102
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,696
     tribes were constantly     
on the move hunting the buffalo,

103
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,164
   which was their main source  
            of food.            

104
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,167
 easy to pack up and reassemble,

105
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,436
        the tepee served        
      as a portable shelter     

106
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,438
   for this nomadic lifestyle.  

107
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,177
 today, people are rediscovering
           the appeal           

108
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,114
      of a cone-shaped tent     
    with a cook fire inside,    

109
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:27,052
    and that's put the tepee    
     on the comeback trail.     

110
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,321
  no need to hand-stitch tepees 
            anymore.            

111
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,657
    today, they produce them    
          at a factory          

112
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,926
              using             
   industrial sewing machines.  

113
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,928
they start with the front panel.

114
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,397
        it's three layers       
      of canvas and vinyl.      

115
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,067
  they sew details like pockets 
  for poles to open smoke flaps 

116
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,368
    and rectangular patterns    

117
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,204
      to prevent stretching     
           and tearing          

118
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:48,006
      from holes for lacing     
 the front of the tepee together

119
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,075
          when pitched.         

120
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,412
   the sewer now chops through  
   the three layers of fabric   

121
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,747
          with a chisel         
      to make those holes.      

122
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,818
another sewer stitches strips of
buffalo hide to the door opening

123
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,888
     to make it more rugged.    

124
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,423
   using a pattern as a guide,  

125
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,526
      the next worker cuts      
another panel on a slight curve.

126
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,299
     he then pieces together    
        panel after panel       

127
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,169
          to construct          
   the rest of the tepee cone.  

128
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,311
      he reinforces the hem     
    with heavy nylon webbing.   

129
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,647
     he tucks loops between     
   the webbing and the fabric   

130
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,384
        and secures them        
      with more stitching.      

131
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:36,155
 the loops will be used to stake
    the tepee to the ground.    

132
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:43,062
     the team stretches out     
   the completed tepee cover.   

133
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:46,665
  an artist maps out some lines 
   for painting on the fabric.  

134
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,467
     there's 73 yards of it.    

135
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,538
    it becomes a huge canvas    
    for traditional artistry.   

136
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,874
         the designs are        
   southwest american in style  

137
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,609
      and highly symbolic.      

138
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,080
      circles can represent     
 phases of the moon or the sun. 

139
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,086
     a sample of the artwork    
  has been drawn up beforehand  

140
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:10,556
 for the client, and the artist 
   refers to it as she works.   

141
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:14,360
she brushes exterior latex paint
       thinned with water       

142
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:17,296
      around the perimeter      
         of the designs.        

143
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:19,631
     then she soaks up paint    
           onto a pad           

144
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,901
  and presses it to the fabric  
    within the painted lines.   

145
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,769
    this avoids brushstrokes    

146
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,607
   and produces a flat finish   
   that almost looks like dye.  

147
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,444
   with the artwork complete,   

148
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,614
    the tepee cover now makes   
      a colorful statement.     

149
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,785
   outside, an employee shaves  
    the bark off young trees    

150
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,986
      to prepare the poles.     

151
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,322
     there are 17 per tepee.    

152
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,124
   each one is 27 feet tall --  

153
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,793
           the height           
    of a two-story building.    

154
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,263
 a two-person team now arranges 
       three of the poles       

155
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,400
     in a specific sequence     
       to build the tripod      

156
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,336
   that is the basic framework  
          of the tepee.         

157
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,805
 the assembler lashes the poles 
          near the top          

158
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,807
         with thick rope        
        and a tight knot.       

159
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:08,547
  he leaves a length of rope to 
dangle as they raise the tripod.

160
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,949
   the rope will come in handy  
            later on.           

161
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,892
    the arrangement situates    
          the door pole         

162
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:23,562
  east towards the rising sun   
  and away from westward winds  

163
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,298
      that could interfere      
      with the cook fire.       

164
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,436
        the team props up       
       the remaining poles      

165
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,371
 between the main tripod poles. 

166
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:36,307
  the first two groups of poles 
  form the front of the tepee,  

167
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,777
     and a third group forms    
            the back.           

168
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,378
  the assembler grabs the rope  

169
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,847
       that still dangles       
    from the central tripod,    

170
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,248
      and, from the ground,     

171
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,953
  winds it around all the poles 
   where they meet at the top.  

172
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,458
     the last pole is called    
        the lifting pole.       

173
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,929
 it's used to lift the painted  
 tepee cover to the wood frame. 

174
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,867
     they unbundle the cover    
  and wrap it around the poles  

175
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,303
         like a blanket         
  around a person's shoulders.  

176
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,542
 once the fit is nice and snug, 

177
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,744
    he laces the front panels   
            together            

178
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,814
      using willow branches     
        for lacing pins.        

179
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,550
   there are 18 pins in total   

180
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:22,420
    fastened above and below    
          the doorway.          

181
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,691
he pegs the canvas to the ground
and then installs two last poles

182
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,429
     for opening and closing    
the smoke flaps from the ground.

183
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,633
      traditional in design     

184
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,369
    with modern-day materials   
        and construction,       

185
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:41,440
   the tepee is still an idea   
         worth pitching.        

186
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,658
    narrator: "croissant" is    
 the french word for "crescent."

187
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,462
   this flaky, curved roll is   
generally associated with france

188
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,664
even though many food historians
             believe            

189
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,865
    its origins are austrian.   

190
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,000
           regardless           
     of where it came from,     

191
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,670
        the croissant is        
   a popular breakfast pastry   

192
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,639
   in many parts of the world.  

193
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,080
        plain, with jam,        
  or dipped in a cup of coffee, 

194
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,150
 there's nothing like the light,
          flaky texture         

195
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,519
       and buttery flavor       
         of a croissant.        

196
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,425
  this commercial bakery makes  
         its croissants         

197
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,961
   with soft-spread margarine   
       in lieu of butter.       

198
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,631
the other ingredients are yeast,
       very cold water --       

199
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,967
       because warm water       
     would trigger the yeast    

200
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,301
     to react prematurely --    

201
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:50,776
     sugar, a touch of salt,    
  and white all-purpose flour.  

202
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,316
       all the ingredients      
  go inside an industrial mixer 

203
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:58,716
        for 10 minutes --       

204
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,654
  first at slow speed to blend  
 everything and form the dough, 

205
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,524
    then faster to knead it.    

206
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:11,663
next, the sticky, elastic dough 
enters the multi-roller machine.

207
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,997
    as an automated dispenser   

208
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,866
     lightly dusts the dough    
           with flour           

209
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,335
   to prevent it from sticking  
        to the equipment,       

210
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,606
     a series of 16 rollers     
progressively flattens the dough

211
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,941
         into a thinner         
       and thinner sheet.       

212
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,277
  the next process, lamination, 

213
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,147
         is what creates        
  the croissant's flaky layers. 

214
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,216
 the first station on this line 

215
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,752
    extrudes 44-pound blocks    
          of margarine          

216
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,088
   into a 2/10-of-an-inch-thin  
             sheet.             

217
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,124
      the next station lays     
       the margarine sheet      

218
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,558
 on top of the thin dough sheet 

219
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,229
then folds the ends of the dough
             upward,            

220
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,566
    enveloping the margarine.   

221
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,434
      then rollers compress     
    the overlapped dough ends   

222
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,902
  to seal the margarine inside  

223
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:55,507
and flatten the whole thing down
to about 4/10-of-an-inch thick. 

224
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,378
  the next station repeatedly   
  folds the dough over itself,  

225
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,046
    then, with rollers again,   

226
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,748
       presses the layers       
       into a thin sheet.       

227
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,784
  this laminating cycle repeats 
       over and over again      

228
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,454
     until each dough block     
       coming off the line      

229
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,923
      comprises 243 layers.     

230
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,993
  plastic wrap keeps the dough  
              moist             

231
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,997
       as it now undergoes      
  eight hours of refrigeration. 

232
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,266
       the cold re-hardens      
  the by-now softened margarine 

233
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,802
           and lessens          
     the dough's elasticity.    

234
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,806
     the dough is now ready     
    for the automated machine   

235
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,608
   that forms the croissants.   

236
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,812
 the first rollers progressively
  flatten the connected blocks  

237
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,548
       into a thin sheet.       

238
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,951
  then another roller runs over 
     the dough horizontally     

239
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,887
       to expand the sheet      
     to the required width.     

240
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,424
 next, cutters divide the sheet 
     into seven thin bands,     

241
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,693
   each one four inches wide.   

242
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,030
     then a roller surfaced     
      in triangular blades      

243
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,700
     cuts each band of dough    
         into triangles.        

244
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:59,104
 a robot separates the triangles

245
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,372
       and turns them all       
      in the same direction     

246
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,741
   with the flat side forward.  

247
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,714
   a stopper running the width  
      of the conveyor belt      

248
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,450
      aligns the triangles      
        in straight rows        

249
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,517
      for the next station,     

250
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,587
          inside which          
  a device rolls each triangle  

251
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,923
into the shape of the croissant.

252
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,526
    the bakery's two forming    
            machines            

253
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:26,465
          output 50,000         
 raw-dough croissants per hour. 

254
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:30,202
    next stop -- the proofer,   
  a steam chamber inside which  

255
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,538
   the heat and high humidity   
       activate the yeast.      

256
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,806
        the dough rises,        

257
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:38,143
 and by the time the croissants 
       exit an hour later,      

258
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,878
    they've doubled in size.    

259
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
  they now bake for 14 minutes  
        in a tunnel oven        

260
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,485
        at a temperature        
   of 350 degrees fahrenheit.   

261
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,219
    the moisture in the dough   
           evaporates,          

262
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,490
 the resulting steam, along with
     the melting margarine,     

263
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,159
      producing air bubbles     
   which separate the layers,   

264
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,161
            creating            
    that signature flakiness.   

265
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,098
         the croissants         
      are now fully baked,      

266
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,368
   golden brown, and fragile.   

267
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,104
    soft rubber suction cups    
    delicately transfer them    

268
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,073
       to a conveyor belt.      

269
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,578
         the belt leads         
       to a spiral tower.       

270
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,781
   by the time the croissants   
     descend to the bottom,     

271
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,516
   they've completely cooled.   

272
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,853
  as they travel to packaging,  

273
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,490
    a quality inspector pulls   
    any misshapen croissant.    

274
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,663
   a multi-tasking robot slaps  
        an adhesive label       

275
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,532
        on plastic bags,        

276
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:36,268
     counts out and drops in    
      two dozen croissants,     

277
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,604
  then securely seals the bags  
    to lock in the freshness    

278
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,774
   until the croissants reach   
      your breakfast table.     

279
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,560
            narrator:           
     thousands of years ago,    
   someone invented the wheel.  

280
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,032
    in 1970, this fundamental   
invention was applied to luggage

281
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,568
             thanks             
to an american luggage executive

282
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,836
  who came up with the concept  

283
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:13,638
    while carrying heavy bags   
           on a trip.           

284
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,676
     by the 1980s, virtually    
     all luggage had wheels.    

285
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,383
 today, we take rolling luggage 
 with us everywhere we travel.  

286
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,785
   they take the heavy lifting  
          out of a trip         

287
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,787
      so it feels more like     
           a vacation.          

288
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,456
  these hard-shell rolling bags 

289
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,660
              start             
   with polypropylene pellets.  

290
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,929
   it's a synthetic material.   

291
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,599
     they add a small amount    
of colored polypropylene pellets

292
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,534
     to the uncolored ones.     

293
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:47,538
      they'll act as a dye      
         for the batch.         

294
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,208
       they allow the mix       
       to dry for an hour,      

295
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,346
  getting rid of humidity that  
would freeze in icy temperatures

296
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,014
      and cause the luggage     
          to fracture.          

297
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,151
        they mix and melt       
    the polypropylene pellets   

298
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,219
    into a thick blue liquid.   

299
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,223
 then it's over to the injection
         molding system.        

300
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,358
         the molds close        

301
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,862
      and a nozzle injects      
    the liquid polypropylene.   

302
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,500
     the molds are equipped     
     with a cooling system      

303
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,170
    so that the polypropylene   
    hardens almost instantly    

304
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,239
       into a lightweight       
      yet durable material.     

305
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,576
    a pile of pellets becomes   
     half of a luggage shell    

306
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,912
        in mere seconds.        

307
00:17:26,914 --> 00:17:31,216
  a robot transfers the molded  
   shell to the next station.   

308
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:37,322
        an employee glues       
  the company logo into a slot. 

309
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:40,859
   to ensure it really sticks,  
 it's over to the logo machine. 

310
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,594
    it uses hydraulic energy    

311
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,596
        to press the logo       
      firmly into position.     

312
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,401
 he now screws a service handle 
      into its molded slot.     

313
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,536
 this handle is for those times 

314
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,939
  when the traveler has to lift 
   the bag by hand, up stairs,  

315
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,341
     or onto a baggage belt.    

316
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,681
  these triangular molded parts 
       are the side feet.       

317
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,082
    they'll keep the luggage    
            upright.            

318
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,752
         he fastens them        
   onto the base of the shell.  

319
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,488
  it's time to close this bag.  

320
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,757
     he adds the other half.    

321
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,361
     he threads a steel rod     
        into hinge holes        

322
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,197
to hold the two shells together.

323
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,842
     next, they mold wheels     
           from nylon.          

324
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:35,046
  a robot transfers the wheels  
  to another part of the mold.  

325
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:39,050
  the mold closes and a nozzle  
   pipes in hot liquid rubber   

326
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,052
           to apply it          
     to the rolling surface     

327
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,654
         of the wheels.         

328
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,957
 the rubber adheres to the nylon
         and solidifies.        

329
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,600
     they attach two wheels     
     to a polypropylene hub     

330
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,569
  for stable swiveling action.  

331
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,979
  a factory worker now inserts  
      an extendable handle.     

332
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,550
 then, working from the inside, 

333
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,020
      she screws the handle     
      to the luggage shell.     

334
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,689
  she reinforces the connection 
      with a metal bracket,     

335
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,824
            ensuring            
   that the extendable handle   

336
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,595
         will hold fast         
  even when the load is heavy.  

337
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,965
      she plugs the wheels      
        into their slots        

338
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:31,035
   in the base of the luggage.  

339
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,905
  she secures them with screws. 

340
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:39,443
  this bag is now mobile with   
  360-degree swiveling action.  

341
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:44,516
 the next employee installs this
 water-resistant rubber piping. 

342
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:48,319
      it will seal the bag      
     and keep the rain out.     

343
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:52,023
  she presses it onto the edge  
      of one of the shells.     

344
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:58,596
      she attaches brackets     
      for hanging dividers      

345
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,599
       to the other shell.      

346
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:05,070
   she snaps three side-locks   
and one central combination lock

347
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:08,740
          onto the bag.         

348
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,743
         she screws down        
  the hanging divider brackets. 

349
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:15,680
   the fabric liner, with its   
 zippered pockets, goes in next.

350
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:23,388
the elastic dividers extend from
  it to attach to the brackets. 

351
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,026
 it's time for the tumble test. 

352
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,228
 a technician places the luggage
    in a rolling steel drum,    

353
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,764
     and it bounces around.     

354
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,234
     they conduct this test     
         on a random bag        

355
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,702
       every now and then       

356
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:41,573
   to confirm that the luggage  
 will bear up to rough handling.

357
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:46,144
    and with that, these bags   
    are ready for a vacation.   

358
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,861
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,
