 in a powerful bending machine, 

26
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,465
       which is capable of      
   exerting 55 tons of force.

 using the square and calipers, 

28
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,772

          that the bend         

29
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,375
     is a perfectly uniform

  all four sides of the plate,  

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,787
    the worker then mounts it   
       onto a locator pin       

35
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,122
       in a second press,       

36
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,590
         which descends         
 and creates a small depression 

37
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,360
   around the central opening.  

38
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,002
 this depression will facilitate
      the welding process.

   using another locator pin,   

40

    a welder clamps the plate   
    into a purpose-built jig.   

41
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,012
   he then begins welding all   
   of the necessary components

43
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,549
         he uses a bolt         
       to correctly locate      

44
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,885
 an internal reinforcement plate

45
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,688
        and also welds in       
      the crucial pivot pin     

46
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,958
     on which the mechanism     
           will hinge.          

47
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,296
        the casing plates       
     are mounted on spacers     

48
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,698
          to help speed         
       the drying process.      

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,702
   then a worker spray-paints   
           them black.          

50
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:55,374
      once dry, he removes      
a protective cap from the pivot.

51
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,044
  it's now time to manufacture  

52
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:01,246
        the wall-mounted        
        spring mechanism.       

53
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,983
   a worker uses a drill press  
  outfitted with a countersink  

54
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:10,322
   to create a beveled recess   
      around the openings.      

55
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,325
       a worker then uses       
   a specially-designed press   

56
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:17,730
   to install a brass bearing   
     in one of the openings.    

57
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,932
          the mechanism         
       is nearly complete.      

58
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:27,273
however, there are still several
   steps to go in the process.  

59
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,542
  next, a worker brushes grease 

60
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:33,145
        onto the interior       
    of two mechanism casings.   

61
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,748
     he then flips them over    
        in order to apply       

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,918
     a specially-formulated     
    grease to the pivot pin.    

63
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,022
  he slides the bushing over it 

64
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,992
     and applies a c-shaped     
         locking washer.        

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,364
   an s-shaped stop will lock   
     the mechanism in place     

66
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,333
   until the bed is installed.  

67
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,905
 the spring-unit assemblage will
 provide the resistance required

68
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,708
     to help smoothly raise     
       and lower the bed.       

69
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:10,515
  a locking pin secures one end 
  of the spring unit in place.  

70
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,785
   the worker adds the bottom   
       plate of the unit,       

71
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:16,522
 which includes a threaded bolt.

72
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,458
     a nut threaded onto it     
  can be tightened or loosened  

73
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,195
            to adjust           
    the mechanism's tension.    

74
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,930

    is ready to be installed.   

76
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:33,338
    it's designed to connect    
 to this bed-mounted component. 

77
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,874
    once mounted to the bed,    

78
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:37,142
       the two components       
         work together,         

79
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,646
   allowing the user to easily  
    raise and lower the bed.    

80
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,619
    a worker quickly installs   
    the bed-mounted component   

81
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,990
    using pre-drilled holes,    
    bolts, and locking nuts.    

82
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,495
 he installs the wall bed's legs
        in the same way,        

83
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,564
     following a pre-drilled    
          hole pattern          

84
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,299
     to locate the component    

85
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,967
    and attach it with bolts,   

86
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,237
    locking nuts, and screws.   

87
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,374
     the legs fold down when    
      the bed is being used     

88
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,943
     and tuck out of the way    
     when the bed folds up.     

89
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,316

00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,570
 after a final stir, the mix is 
  ready for a freezing process, 

128
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,405
 during which, air will be added

129
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:24,376
         to turn the mix        
      into soft ice cream.      

130
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,711
it's time to cue the containers.

131
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,715
 two at a time, individual-sized
    sundae cups move forward    

132
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,385
     on the production line.    

133
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,554
        they meet up with       
    the ice cream dispenser.    

134
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,392
     it automatically pumps     
         precise amounts        

135
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,295
  of the soft vanilla ice cream 
         into the cups.         

136
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,002
        it fills the cups       
        to the 3/4 mark,        

137
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,438
     leaving plenty of room     
          for toppings.         

138
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,341
    it's now time to prepare    

139
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,944
         the next layer         
       of deliciousness --      

140
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,413
   the chocolate fudge sauce.   

141
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,014
    a worker mixes skim milk    

142
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,684
         and sweeteners         
    to a frothy consistency,    

143
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:11,156
and then adds several large bags
       of dark rich cocoa.      

144
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,360
    the mixer paddle agitates   
  the ingredients to distribute 

145
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,895
  the cocoa evenly throughout.  

146
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,968
  the chocolate fudge is pumped 
       into a plastic tote      

147
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,304
       to cool overnight.       

148
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:26,504
         during cooling,        

149
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,308
      the sauce thickens up     
         substantially.         

150
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,847
         it's now a rich        
     chocolate fudge syrup.     

151
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,584
  velvety smooth, the chocolate 
   syrup flows out of the tote  

152
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,420
      and into a big tank.      

153
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,591
  from there, nozzles dispense  
    the chocolate fudge syrup   

154
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:51,129
   onto the vanilla ice cream   
          in the cups.          

155
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,932
      next, a worker pours      
     a liquid-topping blend     

156
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,068
 into a high-speed mixer system 

157
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,470
          that beats it         
    to a whipped consistency.   

158
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,542
         nozzles deposit        
       the whipped topping      

159
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,279
     onto the syrup-covered     
           ice cream.           

160
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,748
      now it's time to add      
      some chocolate crunch     

161
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,117
  to the smooth, sweet sundae.  

162
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,022
      the system sprinkles      
   semi-sweet chocolate chunks  

163
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,359
    onto the whipped topping.   

164
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,095
      it's the final touch.     

165
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,364
       these single-serve       
        chocolate sundaes       

166
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:30,368
       have been prepared       
  almost entirely by machines.  

167
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,905
    a conveyor now sends them   
   through an icy blast of air  

168
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,441
       for a quick freeze.      

169
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:42,114
 exiting the freezer, the frozen
     sundaes travel forward,    

170
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:46,518
   shielded by overhead guards  
    for food-safety reasons.    

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,754
       the sundaes funnel       
    into a single-file lane.    

172
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,391
       this positions them      
        to receive lids.        

173
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,062
   the lids slide down a chute  
         and land on top        

174
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,132
  of the ice cream sundae cups. 

175
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,802
     rollers press the lids     
        down on the rims.       

176
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:10,776
 a revolving apparatus deposits 
plastic collars around the lids.

177
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:17,282
  moving forward, the machinery 
      sorts the sundae cups     

178
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,084
         in row of two.         

179
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,553
       this allows a robot      
      with suctioning arms      

180
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,588
    to pick up six at a time    

181
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,893
          and pack them         
      into a cardboard box.     

182
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,962
 the boxes travel under and over
          packing tape          

183
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,132
  to seal the tops and bottoms. 

184
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:41,506
    incredibly, this factory    
    produces 1,440 ice cream    

185
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:45,244
  sundae cups every 15 minutes. 

186
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:49,847
     and it's all thanks to     
   the magic of mechanization.  

187
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,385
 this company also produces tubs
     of flavored ice cream,     

188
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,654
        so there are many       
     mouth-watering choices     

189
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,123
           to be made           
        at dessert time.

  narrator: digital painting is 
    a relatively new medium.    

193
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,279
  it's an artistic hybrid that  

194
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,481
         marries modern         
       computer technology

196
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,020
 today, some photography studios
     offer digital painting     

197
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,756
      as a way to transform     
     photographic portraits     

198
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,525
     into painted portraits.    

199
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,366
  this specialized photographer 
     offers digital painting    

200
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,835
  to enhance original portraits 

201
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,238
    and cherished snapshots.    

202
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,174
   his studio also specializes  

203
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,044
in creating life-story collages.

204
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,845
  the in-house artist assembles 

205
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,714
    photos and illustrations,   

206
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,782
       depicting elements       

207
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,584
   of the subject's lifetime.   

208
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,387
 she scans and digitizes photos 

209
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,590
 which are not already digital. 

210
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,927
     she manually retouches     
 every image with a digital pen 

211
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,597
           and tablet           
    to maximize the quality.    

212
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,740
     then she begins working    
  on the layout of the collage. 

213
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,746
     once she has finalized     
           the layout,          

214
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,081
      she blends the edges      
          of each image         

215
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,216
      so that the elements      
         flow seamlessly        

216
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,452
        into each other.        

217
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,558
      now the artist begins     
       digitally painting.      

218
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,095
  she chooses from a selection  
   of brush shapes and sizes,   

219
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,264
  and from a myriad of colors.  

220
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,840
    she applies digital paint   
     to blur the hard lines     

221
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,041
       of the photographs       

222
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,044
     to make them look more     
      like painted images.      

223
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,049
      this painting process     

224
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:09,788
       takes several hours      
      of painstaking work.      

225
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,724
 she sends the digital painting 
      to the lab technician     

226
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,861
      who prepares to print     
     the work onto a canvas.    

227
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,199
        first, he tweaks        
      the entire painting,      

228
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,036
    balancing the brightness    
         and the colors.        

229
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,077
  he prints a small test sample 

230
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,013
           on canvas.           

231
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,682
       both the technician      
         and the artist         

232
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,686
 meticulously examine the sample
      under magnification,      

233
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,890
    looking for any painting    
       or printing errors.      

234
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,625
    if everything is perfect,   

235
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:50,695
 the technician installs a large
   canvas roll on the printer.  

236
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,631
       the machine prints,      
     not with regular inks,     

237
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,100
   but with archival pigments,  

238
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:59,037
    which last for centuries.   

239
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,505
        after each pass,        

240
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,240
   the head waits six seconds   

241
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,109
    to let the pigments dry.    

242
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:08,780
this prevents them from smearing
        on the next pass.       

243
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,317
  a digital painting this size  
   takes five hours to print.   

244
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,456
      the pigments must dry     
          for 72 hours          

245
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,359
   to ensure they're embedded   
        into the canvas.        

246
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,795
   then the technician applies  
  a coat of stabilizing lacquer 

247
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,730
           to protect           
     the surface from damage    

248
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,801
   caused by ultraviolet rays   
          or handling.          

249
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,770
     the lacquer takes about    
         an hour to dry.        

250
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,806
      then they can safely      
        mount the canvas        

251
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,542
      on a stretcher frame.     

252
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,344
    the workers pull it tight

   and thinner ones in others.  

258
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,900
      this gives the print      
   the texture of a painting.   

259

    as it dries for 24 hours.   

260
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,574
     then the artist paints     
    the entire printed canvas   

261
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,976
      with acrylic paints.

      the fabric in plastic     

293
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,546
  to hold the prepreg in place. 

294
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:57,215
 then he suspends the cylinders 
           from a rack          

295
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,184

307
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,786
      of prepreg material,      

308
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,222
         which she folds        
        into thin strips.       

309
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,928
     the key is to make sure    
    each strip is identical.    

310
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,129
       in the next phase,       

311
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,799
    a worker wraps the strip    
   around a purpose-built mold  

312
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,202
       to create the shape      
       of a racquet frame.      

313
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,343
 she introduces the carbon-fiber
      shaft into the mold.      

314
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,412
  the racquet is taking shape.  

315
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,148
  another piece of carbon fiber 

316
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,484
  forms the joint between them. 

317
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,986
        the frame-shaped        
      prepreg carbon fiber      

318
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,155
         then goes into         
       a shaping machine,       

319
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,758
       and the lid closes.      

320
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,228
    the shaping machine heats   
   and then cools the prepreg   

321
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,531
         over the course        
      of about 30 minutes.      

322

     a worker lifts the lid     

323
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,636
  and removes the fully-formed  
         racquet frame,         

324
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,339
     which has excess resin.    

325
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,244
  resin holds the carbon fibers 
            together            

326
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,246
   before the curing process.   

327
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,181
    heating expels the resin,   

328
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,585
   which must then be removed.  

329
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,387
       a narrow bit drills      
   the first sequence of holes  

330
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,856
      in an offset pattern      

331
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:47,292
       to make the racquet      
        easier to string.       

332
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,664
    a larger-gauge bit drills   
       holes large enough       

333
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,100
      to permit two strings     
        to pass through.        

334
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,405
   quality-control inspectors   
choose a racquet frame at random

335
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,474
        to test how much        
      pressure it can bear      

336
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,710
        before it reaches       
       the breaking point.      

337
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:13,150
    it's finally time to add    
        the wooden handle       

338
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,454
      and cap to the shaft      
  and put everything together.  

339

    the painting department,    

340
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,696
 where they receive a base coat.

341
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:29,100
 then workers meticulously apply
       a series of decals.      

342
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,835
    the decals soak in water    

343
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,271
        to make it easier       
     to remove the backing.     

344
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,179
    a worker slides each hole   
           over a pin           

345

   specially-designed grommets  

347
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,652
         into the holes.        

348
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,124
    the grommets are slightly   
       too long to ensure       

349
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:56,861

  to the frame by this machine. 

350
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,135
     in a two-part process,     
   this pressing machine heats  

351
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,738
  and then presses the cut side 
         of the grommets        

352
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,206
       to smooth them out.      

353
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,814
  a worker carefully clamps the 
 racquet into a winding machine 

354
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,949

355

 of the handle wrap at the base,

356
