      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications

00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,252
   narrator: the jaws of life   
     were first used in 1963    

4
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,922
     to free racecar drivers    
        from car crashes.       

5
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,256
         it was so big,         

6
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,559
     it had to be suspended     
from the back of a pickup truck.

7
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,263
         today it weighs        
     as little as 33 pounds     

8
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,332
       and is small enough      
   for one person to operate.   

9
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:10,803
 it can free an accident victim 
     from a car in minutes.     

10
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,944
   in an emergency situation,   
      timing is everything.     

11
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,818
  a rescue tool has to pry open 
a vehicle as easily as a tin can

12
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,087
   or cut through solid steel   
          like butter,          

13
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,124
      because a few seconds     
  can make all the difference.  

14
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,566
  what gives the cutting blades 

15
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:43,836
     and the spreading arms     
 their power is hydraulic fluid.

16
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,109
     the jaws of life begin     
     with a milling machine     

17
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,644
  that shapes the spreader arms 

18
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,981
       from a bar of solid      
    aircraft-grade aluminum.    

19
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:07,091
   the spreader arms then get   
      a protective coating.     

20
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:12,064
 a lathe now makes the cap that 
  fits on the end of the tool.  

21
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,267
 a high-speed carbide tip shapes
       the solid aluminum       

22
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,336
     into a finished endcap     
      that is then drilled      

23
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,907
      and treated to a coat     
  of rust-resistant protection. 

24
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:33,351
  arms that both cut and spread 
    are made from tool steel.   

25
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,489
 a surface grinder ensures that 
the two arms are perfectly flat.

26
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,560
    a worker installs a seal    

27
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,428
          that prevents         
       the hydraulic fluid      

28
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,531
        from leaking out        
        of the cylinder.        

29
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,836
     he lubricates a piston     
      with hydraulic fluid      

30
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:55,240
 so it slides into the cylinder 
 without damaging the interior. 

31
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,778
       then he taps it in       

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,748
       so it will connect       
     with the link assembly.    

33
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,120
   he attaches a link assembly  
          to the piston         

34
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,557
    and secures it in place.    

35
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,193
 the link assembly relays power 

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,696
      to the cutting blades     
        or spreader arms.       

37
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,602
  he then attaches an assembled 
     end cap to the cylinder    

38
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,705
     and bolts it in place.     

39
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,678
    he connects the two hoses   

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,016
     that lead to the tool's    
       hydraulic cylinder.      

41
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:41,152
      he puts on a handgrip     
     that protects the hoses    

42
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,690
       and makes it easier      
     to work the thumbwheel.    

43
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:48,427
      he tightens the bolts     
and completes the control valve.

44
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,829
        he then attaches        
        the front handle        

45
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,166
    that allows the operator    
    to hold the tool safely.    

46
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,438
 this protective guard will keep
    all the moving components   

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
  away from a rescuer's hands.  

48
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,783
    then he aligns the holes    
    in the blades to the tool   

49
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:15,020
 and inserts a steel pivot pin. 

50
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,396
      he puts on a locknut,     

51
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,199
   and, as with all fasteners   
       on the rescue tool,      

52
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,669
   he tightens it to a precise  
   engineering specification.   

53
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,476
   after mounting the blades,   

54
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,210
         he secures them        
      to the link assembly      

55
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,514
     with a steel-alloy pin     
        and a snap ring.        

56
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,424
          then he folds         
    the protective guard back   

57
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,092
     and finishes assembling    
            the tool.           

58
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,710
  a worker then tests the tool, 
      which has been filled     

59
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,313
       with fire-resistant      
        hydraulic fluid.        

60
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:18,250
 the fixture he uses is designed
     to measure the pressure    

61
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,086
     at the strongest point     
         in the cutting.        

62
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,561
         the tool passes        
       the pressure test.       

63
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,864
   whether it's a rescue tool   

64
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,066
     that cuts through metal    
        or pries it open,       

65
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,870
    emergency-response teams    
  arriving on an accident scene 

66
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,540
     will have what it takes    
       to help save lives.      

67
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,084
      narrator: the quest       
      for the perfect tree      

68
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,485
is a rite of the holiday season.

69
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,288
         and ever since         
     the late 19th century,     

70
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,023
 people have been trying to come
 up with an artificial version. 

71
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,892
             first,             
    there were feather trees    

72
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,495
           and, later,          
 trees made of animal bristles. 

73
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,430
        but by the 1960s,       

74
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:10,068
  the use of synthetics finally 
  gave us the perfect fake fir. 

75
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,774
        today's faux firs       
 can be several stories tall -- 

76
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,176
big enough for your town square.

77
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,778
        you can get them        
   with many of the trimmings   

78
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,714
          so decorating         
      isn't such a stretch.     

79
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,919
these big artificial trees start
     with a steel skeleton.     

80
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,789
    rollers bend steel tubing   
           into arcs.           

81
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:35,059
   they'll be joined to form    
   the base of the framework.   

82
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,663
 workers weld vertical supports 
          to the arcs,          

83
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,032
     building the structure     
          in sections.          

84
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,738
   a spray of polyester powder  

85
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,207
     gives the welded metal     
         a smooth finish        

86
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,277
     that's actually tougher    
           than paint.          

87
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,714
       they bake the parts      
       to set the coating.      

88
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,752
     after a quick cooling,     

89
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,755
      it's time to assemble     
         all the pieces.        

90
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,960
           they fasten          
     the structure together     

91
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,396
   with u-bolts and a ratchet.  

92
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,770
           meanwhile,           
   a roll of green pvc plastic  

93
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,238
 winds its way towards a roller 

94
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,908
            equipped            
   with many circular cutters.  

95
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,912
          they slice it         
    into 4-inch-wide strips.    

96
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,249
       each of the narrow       
         plastic strips         

97
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,119
    then goes under a roller    
     with even more blades.     

98
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,922
       they shred it into       
   a needlelike configuration,  

99
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,123
      leaving a solid spine     
          at the center         

100
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,694
  to hold the simulated needles 
            together.           

101
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:51,403
an automated spool then winds up
     the fringed green pvc.     

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,475
these artificial needles come in
    an assortment of colors,    

103
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,446
      so if you want glitz,     
you can really go out on a limb.

104
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,485
              here,             
  streams of the fringed green  

105
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:11,356
 and a strip of brown pvc travel
  over tension-control guides.  

106
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:16,561
  steel wire unwinds and merges 
  with the green and brown pvc. 

107
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,364
          this machine          
      twists them together.     

108
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:23,501
    the brown strip lands at    
 the core of the twisted fringe,

109
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,172
      creating the illusion     
  of a stem among the needles.  

110
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,107
    this twisting technology    

111
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,677
 churns out a continuous supply 
     of artificial greenery.    

112
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,983
     giant scissors slice it    
     to the correct length.     

113
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,257
        to make branches        
    that appear snow-tipped,    

114
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,260
       this machine twists      
 and then frosts the pvc needles

115
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,863
          with a spray          
      of white latex paint.     

116
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,337
   they use this ring fastener  

117
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,742
 to crimp the artificial foliage
   together, branch by branch.  

118
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:07,211
   this creates a tightly knit  
        mass of greenery        

119
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,815
   that will be used to cover   
      the tree's framework.     

120
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,691
   they apply single garlands   

121
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,294
          on key parts          
     of the tree grid first,    

122
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,564
        using a handheld        
       pneumatic fastener.      

123
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,901
          they fill in          
    the sections between them   

124
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,902
  with the assembled branches.  

125
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,373
       this is easier than      
 attaching them to the framework

126
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,075
        branch by branch.       

127
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,579
     they string the lights     

128
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,416
      and then plug them in     
       to check each bulb.      

129
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:51,389
           after all,           
  it's easier to change one now 

130
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,458
       than after the tree      
        has been erected,       

131
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,394
    especially since this one   
will be a story and a half tall.

132
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:00,665
  they also wire the ornaments  
        to the branches.        

133
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,001
        it's one less job       
     for the customer to do.    

134
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,505
        and now it's time       
       to put up the tree.      

135
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,275
       they bolt the cone       
       of wired greenery        

136
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,677
    to the lower framework...   

137
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,682
   ...and then hook the panels  
     of artificial greenery     

138
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,751
 onto the rest of the structure.

139
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,622
    it has taken just one day   

140
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,358
    for this artificial tree    
        to come together,       

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,627
    where growing a real one    
            this size           

142
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,563
     would take many years.     

143
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,799
 and the convenience is unreal. 

144
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,583
     narrator: soda crackers    
    are also called saltines,   

145
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:55,854
  originally a brand name that  
over time became a generic term.

146
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,455
     you can eat them plain     

147
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,992
   or spread something on them  
   or crumble them into soup.   

148
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,394
     doctors even recommend     
      eating soda crackers      

149
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,528
      when you're nauseous,     

150
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,832
       because they're dry      
       and easy to digest.      

151
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,205
     they're flat and bumpy     
         on the outside,        

152
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,673
      with a tasty texture      

153
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,143
 resulting from some interesting
       chemical reactions.      

154
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,746
     workers first dump ice     
          into a trough         

155
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:25,416
    to prevent the dough from   
overheating during fermentation.

156
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,617
      the first ingredient      

157
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,220
      is a specific amount      
        of finished dough       

158
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,423
 to kick-start the fermentation 
       of this new batch.       

159
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,094
    to that, they add water,    
       wheat flour, yeast,      

160
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,264
           and enzymes          
    to help the fermentation.   

161
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:43,100
 a mixer blends the ingredients 
      for about 5 minutes.      

162
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,903
     they let the dough sit     
          for 16 hours          

163
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,439
  while the enzymes break down  
    the starch and the wheat    

164
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,908
       into simple sugars.      

165
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,711
      the yeast then reacts     
       with those sugars,       

166
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,915
  producing carbon-dioxide gas, 
   which makes the dough rise.  

167
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,320
        then they adjust        
 the fermented dough's ph level 

168
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,921
     with sodium bicarbonate    

169
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,258
  to produce the right flavor,  
     color, and shelf life.     

170
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,396
 then, for additional flavoring,
          some salt...          

171
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:15,066
     malted barley flour...     

172
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,901
       and vegetable oil.       

173
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,277
     then the mixer remixes     
  the dough for about 5 minutes 

174
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,813
           to blend in          
     these new ingredients.     

175
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,684
 now they let the dough ferment 
      for another 6 hours.      

176
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,019
     the sodium bicarbonate     

177
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,488
     counteracts the acidity    
          this produces         

178
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,957
     and relaxes the gluten     
        so that the dough       

179
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,226
        now breaks easily       
        when stretched --       

180
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,896
     the perfect consistency    
       for soda crackers.       

181
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,965
     a machine then extrudes    
        the massive dough       

182
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,902
          into a sheet          
      that's 2 inches thick     

183
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,038
      and folds the sheet       
      over itself 3 times.      

184
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,779
      this folding creates      
   the light and flaky layers   

185
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,781
       inside the cracker.      

186
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,285
    the dough sheet then goes   
   through a series of rollers  

187
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,787
         that reduce it         
     to its final thickness,    

188
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,723
       about a millimeter.      

189
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,594
         a revolving die        
    cuts the cracker shapes,    

190
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,863
      perforations and all.     

191
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,799
    the little pins puncture    
            the dough           

192
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,201
       and push it firmly       
     onto the conveyor belt.    

193
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,603
      this keeps the dough      
         from deforming         

194
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,674
 when moisture and gases escape 
   during the baking process.   

195
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,678
  from there, the sheet passes  
     under a shower of salt.    

196
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,084
            the sheet           
  now takes a three-minute trip 

197
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:44,622
    through a long oven with    
  different temperature zones.  

198
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:49,760
    gas flames bake the dough   
      from above and below.     

199
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:53,297
     the heat transforms the    
 sodium bicarbonate in the dough

200
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,965
    into carbon-dioxide gas,    

201
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,568
    which then breaks through   
          and escapes.          

202
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,704
this drives out trapped moisture

203
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,340
       and forms blisters       
        in the crackers.        

204
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,845
 as the sheet of baked crackers 
         exits the oven,        

205
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,380
  a roller breaks it into rows. 

206
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,325
     the rows then run from     
 one conveyor belt to the next, 

207
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,627
  stacking like roof shingles.  

208
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,465
        alignment wheels        
       keep them straight       

209
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,067
  until the next set of wheels  
     gently breaks the rows     

210
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,570
    into individual crackers.   

211
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,415
     each row makes its way     
    through a series of gates   

212
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,351
   that guide it onto a track   

213
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,453
           that leads           
   to the packaging equipment.  

214
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,161
  the crackers are upright now, 

215
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,364
         and the machine        
      begins dividing them      

216
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,166
     according to the number    
   of crackers per package --   

217
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,969
          in this case,         
  those little 2-cracker packs  

218
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,939
    you often get with soup.    

219
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,047
     the cracker pairs enter    
      the wrapping machine,     

220
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:21,051
  which sandwiches them between 
a sheet of printed plastic film.

221
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,320
          a wheel then          
      simultaneously seals      

222
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,857
      and cuts the wrapper      
       between each pair.       

223
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,660
        this all happens        
     at an astonishing rate     

224
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,096
   of 525 packages per minute.  

225
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,700
       and that's the way       
      the cracker crumbles.     

226
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,214
    narrator: ratchets come     
    in many shapes and sizes    

227
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,550
 and can tackle almost any job. 

228
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:56,286
ratchets with socket attachments
  deliver more power and speed  

229
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,157
        without slipping        
  or damaging the bolt or nut.  

230
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,426
  just snap an interchangeable  
    socket onto the ratchet,    

231
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,130
 and you're ready to get the job
   done quickly and properly.   

232
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,768
   versatile and easy to use,   

233
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,904
  a ratchet tightens or loosens 
         nuts and bolts         

234
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,506
     in a continuous motion.    

235
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,975
    it uses removable sockets   

236
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,512
  that fit many different sizes 
   of fittings and fasteners.   

237
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:25,115
  to start, a steel bar travels 
     into a shearing machine    

238
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,085
          that cuts it          
     into specific lengths.     

239
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,858
  these pieces, called billets, 

240
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,362
          will be used          
      to make the ratchet.      

241
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,866
   a machine feeds the billets  
     into an induction coil,    

242
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,971
    which heats them to about   
    1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

243
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:53,711
    a forge press then shapes   
 the soft billets into ratchets.

244
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,220
      the first die creates     
   the ratchet's general form.  

245
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,956
     the second die gives it    
       its finished shape.      

246
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,094
   and the third die cuts off   
          excess metal.         

247
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,497
        the ratchets exit       
         the forge press        

248
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,300
 and fall into a collection box,
        where they cool.        

249
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,039
 then a vertical milling machine
    prepares the body cavity    

250
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,708
     to receive the internal    
  working parts of the ratchet, 

251
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,577
    called the gear assembly.   

252
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:34,585
a worker then places the ratchet
      on a hydraulic press,     

253
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,454
   which stamps the brand name  

254
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,657
  and the on-and-off indicator  
     on the ratchet's face.     

255
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,663
  a lathe cuts away the rough   
  forged metal from the handle  

256
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,465
     and trims off the end,     

257
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,001
         making it ready        
    to receive the handgrip.    

258
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,205
      a worker then grinds      
         any rough edges        

259
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,708
    off the machined ratchet.   

260
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,615
    then he crimps each side    
      of the smooth handle      

261
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,652
         so it will hold        
   a rubber handgrip in place.  

262
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,692
    the ratchets now undergo    
   a 3-stage tempering process  

263
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:18,062
          that hardens          
   and strengthens the metal.   

264
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,703
         ceramic stones         
     and a chemical solution    

265
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:30,241
      prepare the ratchets      
 for nickel and chrome plating. 

266
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,777
        a plating machine       
      cleans the ratchets,      

267
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,915
  then treats them to a nickel  
 and a trivalent chrome plating.

268
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:42,386
      the two platings make     
the ratchets corrosion-resistant

269
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,089
          and give them         
    a bright cosmetic finish.   

270
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,395
    a worker then lubricates    
       the ratchet cavity,      

271
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,397
  puts in an on-and-off switch  

272
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,634
     and a spacer to support    
     additional components.     

273
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,410
 a worker sets a retention ball 
      onto a ratchet gear,      

274
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,580
       then a punch press       
       locks it in place.       

275
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,886
 next they fit a gear mechanism 
        into the cavity,        

276
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,222
           then attach          
   all the internal components  

277
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,292
   that control the movements   
         of the ratchet.        

278
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,163
         once completed,        

279
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,800
    the gear assembly allows    
     or restricts movement.     

280
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,176
  so, putting the assembly into 
  either the on or off position 

281
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,147
   is all it takes to tighten   
    or loosen a nut or bolt.    

282
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,718
   she then puts a rubber seal  
       onto a cover plate       

283
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,887
   and closes up the ratchet.   

284
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,797
she makes sure the gear assembly
         works properly.        

285
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,066
     finally, this machine      
     friction-fits a handle     

286
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,102
     on the ratchet's shaft.    

287
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,741
    evolving from a steel bar   

288
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,477
      to a finished product     
          in 10 steps,          

289
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,680
    the ratchets must undergo   
    a final test of strength    

290
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,618
       to prove they meet       
 the highest quality standards. 

291
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,693
   ratchet sets are available   
     in a variety of sizes.     

292
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:32,697
      they're used for big      
   and small jobs by handymen   

293
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,700
   and professional mechanics   
             alike.
