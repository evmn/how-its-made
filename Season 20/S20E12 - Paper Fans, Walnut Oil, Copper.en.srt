00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,454
narrator: the oldest existing chinese fans,          

2
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:58,991
made of woven bamboo, date to the 2nd century b.c.   

3
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,594
the folding fan was invented in japan      

4
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,462
between the 6th and 9th century.            

5
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,932
fans were typically made of paper or silk,        

6
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,535
and famous artists were often commissioned to paint them.   

7
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,342
the traditional asian fan --   

8
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:19,345
an object of beauty with a practical purpose.    

9
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:23,082
the structure is comprised   
of bamboo sticks, called ribs.  

10
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,085
the paper surface is called the leaf.       

11
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,088
in this fan workshop in northern thailand,      

12
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,424
they begin with narrow poles of locally harvested bamboo.   

13
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,892
with a sharp knife,       

14
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,628
workers cut them to the approximate length of the ribs,              

15
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,298
then split them down the middle.             

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,966
using traditional blades,    

17
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:44,303
they shave each bamboo strip to the shape of a rib.      

18
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,439
ribs are typically about 7/100 of an inch thick   

19
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,908
and perfectly flat        

20
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,379
so that they can smoothly slide on top of one another.      

21
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,384
workers drill a hole in each rib 2 to 3 inches above the base,  

22
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,119
depending on the fan size.    

23
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,788
then they assemble the ribs on a bolt.            

24
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,191
the number of ribs and their length         

25
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,193
are what determine a fan's size.              

26
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,462
the two ribs on the extremities           

27
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,197
are wider and thicker than the others         

28
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,598
and are rounded on the outside.            

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,668
these are called thumb guards  

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,138
because you flick your thumb on them to open the fan     

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,675
and they guard the ribs in between from damage.     

32
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,010
to make the leaf,        

33
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,278
they begin by spreading the ribs,      

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
spacing them out evenly.     

35
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,881
they lay this onto white cotton             

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,885
and cut out the semicircular shape of the leaf        

37
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:36,088
with the fabric extending 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 inches      

38
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,622
beyond the rib tips.       

39
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,226
this fabric will be       
the leaf's structural backing,  

40
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:44,096
giving the paper rigidity and strength.          

41
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,501
they make that paper      
just as their ancestors did --  

42
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,236
mixing the fibrous bark of the mulberry tree       

43
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,638
with natural dyes --       

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,774
the marigold flower for yellow, for example,           

45
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,708
or, as we see here,       

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,847
the root of the madder plant for vibrant red.         

47
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,983
they mix the dyestuff      
with the mulberry bark fibers,  

48
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,985
then gather a thin layer of dyed fibers          

49
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,188
onto a rectangular mesh screen.           

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,457
they keep repeating this process,          

51
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,791
adding layers          

52
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,260
until they build up       
the paper thickness they need.  

53
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,530
then they let the fibers dry in the sun            

54
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:20,332
into a finished sheet of paper.             

55
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,068
when the paper's ready,     

56
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,870
they cut a piece to match the shape of the cotton backing             

57
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,338
and iron them together.     

58
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,007
the two layers naturally adhere to each other,             

59
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,411
thanks to the paper's moisture and a compound in its fibers,  

60
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,614
called lignin, which acts as a natural glue.  

61
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,282
they fold the leaf in half    

62
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,617
and trace a template       

63
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,754
in the shape of the lower section of the fan,  

64
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:43,155
where no paper is required.   

65
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,890
then they cut this part off.   

66
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,096
they brush homemade glue made with white flour      

67
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,698
onto the parts of the ribs    

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,367
that will be in contact with the leaf.          

69
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,702
they lay the ribs on the paper  

70
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,371
and, with an upward sweeping motion,         

71
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,639
press them down,         

72
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,708
at the same time wiping away the excess glue.   

73
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,312
next, they trim the leaf,    

74
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:09,081
leaving about 7/10 of an inch beyond the tips of the ribs.   

75
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,054
they glue the edge...      

76
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,792
...and fold it back over the ribs.          

77
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,605
then they trim the edges along the thumb guards.     

78
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:37,475
now for the most delicate step of the entire process --     

79
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,545
folding the fan for the first time.       

80
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,681
each fold is permanent and will give the fan its form,              

81
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:47,485
both open and closed, so precision is everything.   

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,689
now the fully constructed fan is ready for decoration     

83
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,358
with water-based acrylic paints.             

84
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,095
sometimes the customer requests a certain theme or scene,    

85
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:02,067
but usually it's left to the artist's creativity.   

86
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,105
the artist can manipulate the paints    

87
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,840
to produce a range of effects,  

88
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,176
modifying with acrylic gels, media, or pastes         

89
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,178
to create the bold effect of oil paint           

90
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,715
and diluting with water to varying degrees        

91
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:21,320
to create a transparent effect much like watercolors.      

92
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,590
the final touch is what's known as piping --   

93
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,259
paint applied through a cone-shaped tip    

94
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:30,062
to produce a raised line.    

95
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:33,065
this highlights the artwork with raised details.       

96
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,938
the paint becomes water-resistant once dry,    

97
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,007
protecting the artwork from damage           

98
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,343
and ensuring this ancient objet d'art     

99
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,246
will always be simply fantastic.           

100
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,431
narrator: walnut oil       

101
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,300
has a distinctive, mild, nutty flavor and aroma.     

102
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,635
it's also nutritious       

103
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:12,237
because it's high in omega-3 fatty acids,     

104
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,639
which are crucial for brain function,       

105
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,108
reduce inflammation,       

106
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,711
and may even help lower the risk of heart disease,        

107
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,913
arthritis, and other chronic conditions.  

108
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,387
walnut oil is sometimes used for sauting,           

109
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,922
but it's more often consumed cold,          

110
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,325
typically in salad dressings.  

111
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,594
walnut oil for nonculinary purposes     

112
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,798
goes through a refining process which removes the flavor.    

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,734
walnut oil produced for gastronomy is unrefined,   

114
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,804
so it retains its nutty taste and scent.            

115
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,677
walnut oil has one ingredient and one ingredient only --    

116
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,679
english walnuts.         

117
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,584
the oil factory buys them from the supplier already shelled.  

118
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,290
production methods       
are much the same as they were  

119
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,092
150 years ago.          

120
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:10,829
the first step is to shovel the walnuts into a grinder.   

121
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,230
the grinder pulverizes      

122
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,967
this combination of full kernels and broken pieces        

123
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,770
until everything's fairly uniform,         

124
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,106
roughly 1/10 of an inch in size.              

125
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,442
next step -- roasting.      

126
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,577
workers pour the ground walnuts             

127
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,513
into a cast-iron kettle on a gas burner.         

128
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,848
for 30 minutes or so,      

129
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,717
a rotating arm continuously stirs them     

130
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,187
to ensure they roast evenly.   

131
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,325
roasting enhances both the flavor and aroma.    

132
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:44,129
the shelled walnuts have gone from large pieces        

133
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:48,066
to ground pieces to roasted pieces.        

134
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:52,538
now they're ready to have the oil squeezed out of them.  

135
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,544
this cast-iron expeller press  
dates back to the early 1900s.  

136
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:02,681
workers line the bottom with a mat made of natural fibers.  

137
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:07,018
this will prevent the walnuts from leaking out under pressure.            

138
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,823
after loading the press with the walnuts,        

139
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,959
they close it up         

140
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,195
and set the press in position.  

141
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,966
then they release the piston.  

142
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,237
it descends and applies 2,800 pounds per square inch,  

143
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,172
crushing the walnuts       

144
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,709
and expelling the oil in the process.         

145
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,912
the oil exits the press     

146
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,582
through small slots around the perimeter,      

147
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,183
flows down to a trough,     

148
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,186
which channels it to a spout,  

149
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:46,458
which pours it into a collection vat.      

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,561
4 1/2 pounds of nuts yields 1 quart of oil.      

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,275
what's left in the press is walnut meal.         

152
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:07,612
it's used by pastry chefs to add a nutty crunch to cakes.             

153
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,649
it's also sold to farmers who use it for cattle feed.   

154
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,888
the extracted oil, meanwhile,  

155
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,690
moves on to the last phase of the process --        

156
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,826
filtration.           

157
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:24,763
the filter press is comprised of 16 grooved plates       

158
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,934
made of food-safe plastic,   
with paper filters in between.  

159
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,909
workers compress the plates and filters...          

160
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,116
...then start up a powerful pump,         

161
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,584
which forces the walnut oil   

162
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,921
from one end of the press to the other.          

163
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:52,257
along the way, the filters trap all the miniscule particles   

164
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,327
of walnut, wax, and other natural materials,   

165
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,929
clarifying the oil.       

166
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,865
this process takes a few hours,             

167
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,536
at the end of which the once-cloudy oil is clear.  

168
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,275
packaging walnut oil in clear glass bottles      

169
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,077
would look appetizing      

170
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,013
but would actually shorten the product's shelf life.    

171
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:19,084
that's because walnut oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,             

172
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,820
which, while good for you, are sensitive to light.     

173
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:26,024
therefore, walnut oil is traditionally bottled in tin.              

174
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,827
after the automatic equipment fills the tin container,     

175
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,963
workers loosely apply a snap-on cap,          

176
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,268
which the next machine presses into position.      

177
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,307
last stop -- labeling.      

178
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,443
as the tin spins,        

179
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,245
the machine wraps it in an adhesive-backed label,   

180
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:51,583
neatly aligning the label's seam with the welded seam on the tin.              

181
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:56,120
now the oil's ready       
to drizzle a rich walnut taste  

182
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,325
onto your pasta, grilled meat or fish, or salad.             

183
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,676
narrator: humans have been making things out of copper   

184
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,144
longer than any other metal.   

185
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,413
archaeological digs around the world         

186
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,883
have unearthed copper vessels, tools, weapons, and jewelry   

187
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,619
dating back at least 10,000 years.      

188
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,287
fast-forward to today      

189
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,224
and copper is one mineral we still really dig.       

190
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,164
peel back the layers of modern civilization,     

191
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,532
and there's a lot of copper.   

192
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,635
it's used for electrical motors and wiring,           

193
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,170
high-tech gadgetry and plumbing.            

194
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,174
the metal known chemically as cu               
is essential to modern living.  

195
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,511
pure copper is rarely found in nature.    

196
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,248
it usually occurs with other elements, like iron and sulfur.             

197
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,651
to mine the copper-bearing rock,              

198
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,188
a huge drill chews into this arizona terrain.    

199
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,592
it drills around 130 holes at least 50 feet down.      

200
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,262
a truck pumps explosives into them.            

201
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:15,333
it's a powerful mix of     
ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.  

202
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:18,536
a mine worker lowers the electronic detonating devices  

203
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,073
into each of the 130 holes.   

204
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:27,079
from a safe distance away, he actives the detonators,    

205
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,048
staging the explosions milliseconds apart.       

206
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,955
it's an explosion sequence designed to fracture       

207
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:41,760
as much of the copper-bearing rock as possible.        

208
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,296
shovels scoop up the blasted rock,        

209
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:48,433
lifting 55 to 88 tons in one bite.           

210
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,170
the rock is less than one half of 1% copper.      

211
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,907
freeing the copper from it   
involves different techniques.  

212
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,310
the technique depends on whether the ore is iron-oxide-based   

213
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,313
or sulfide-based.        

214
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:04,116
to process copper from oxide ore,         

215
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:08,520
they pile the rock in specially prepared leeching areas.     

216
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,389
they irrigate the rock      

217
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,258
with a diluted sulfuric-acid solution.     

218
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,662
over months, the solution percolates down   

219
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,262
and dissolves the copper.    

220
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,334
the copper solution drains into a pond.       

221
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:26,003
a pump transfers this solution to the plant.          

222
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,406
in this channel,         

223
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,607
the copper solution binds with an organic agent   

224
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,810
and floats to the top.      

225
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,211
they add an acidic solution   

226
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,947
that increases the concentration of the copper          

227
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,750
and makes it electrically conductive.     

228
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,286
they transfer the copper solution       

229
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,954
to a series of tanks       

230
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,958
that contain starter sheets of pure copper, called cathodes.            

231
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,694
they pass an electrical current through the tank,        

232
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,831
and the copper migrates to the cathodes.         

233
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,034
at the outset, the cathodes are wafer-thin,   

234
00:13:56,036 --> 00:14:01,172
but over a period of 10 days, they thicken substantially.   

235
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,776
they're now an inch thick.    

236
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,246
each one weighs about 275 pounds.        

237
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:12,384
the purity is now 99.99%.    

238
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,987
that's important if the copper is to be processed        

239
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,990
into electrical products.    

240
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:23,528
freeing copper from the sulfide rock is more difficult.     

241
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,299
it starts in a massive tumbler, called a sag mill.        

242
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:31,670
inside, steel grinding balls smash wet rock to pieces.    

243
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,271
exiting the mill,        

244
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,208
the smashed rock travels over a perforated conveyor    

245
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,609
to screen out smaller, pebble-sized rocks.       

246
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,547
these smaller rocks continue on to different grinding mills.   

247
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,483
the larger rocks circle back to the sag mill   

248
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,952
for another round.        

249
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,621
once all the rock has been sufficiently ground,  

250
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,824
they add chemicals which coat the copper particles            

251
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,026
and mix in a frothing substance.           

252
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,829
the slurry flows into floatation tanks.      

253
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,498
air blasts create bubbles    

254
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,701
that the chemically coated copper minerals attach to.    

255
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:06,171
the bubbles carry the minerals to the top of the tank,     

256
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,239
and they overflow.        

257
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,841
after filtering the overflow,  

258
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:14,513
they have a concentrate that's now 25% to 30% copper.  

259
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:20,852
they transfer the concentrate  
by rail to a smelter facility.  

260
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:24,189
here, it goes into several large beds.     

261
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,793
each one is the size of two basketball courts.    

262
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,864
they add silica sand,      

263
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,268
creating a layer cake of sand and copper concentrate.     

264
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,340
the silica sand is known as a flux.       

265
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,675
it will serve as a purifying agent       

266
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:47,145
as the concentrate is smelted.  

267
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,681
in the intense heat of the furnace,         

268
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,484
the silica sand melts to form a slag          

269
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,620
that absorbs the iron and other unwanted minerals.   

270
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,557
the slag floats up, and the copper sinks.      

271
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,159
its purity is now 60%.      

272
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,760
then it's into a second furnace,            

273
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:07,299
where they up the copper content to 98%.             

274
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,769
coming up, there's much more to the story of copper.     

275
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,652
narrator: there are networks of copper   

276
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,587
in the walls of modern buildings --      

277
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,923
wires and pipes that supply utilities      

278
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,125
and keep the household humming.            

279
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,395
hidden behind drywall, it's easy to overlook the contribution   

280
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,464
of this thermally and      
electrically conductive metal.  

281
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,035
but behind the scenes, copper is a big player.     

282
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,075
with the copper now extracted from the ore,   

283
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,612
they pour the residue onto a heap.           

284
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:57,281
this molten slag flows down like lava from a volcano.    

285
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,818
as it cools, it becomes part of the landscape.      

286
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,554
meanwhile, in the smelter,    

287
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,223
a crane delivers the fiery liquid copper     

288
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,560
into another furnace for further purification.    

289
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,295
inside this furnace,       

290
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:16,901
the purity level increases from 98% to 99.4%.        

291
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,105
the molten copper flows out of the furnace     

292
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,706
and into rotating molds.     

293
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,912
the molds shape the copper into big, rectangular slabs,   

294
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,814
called anodes.          

295
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:35,720
the slabs will serve as positively charged electrodes  

296
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,390
in the electrorefining process that's still to come.      

297
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,929
that process will take the purity level up one last notch.             

298
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,602
the copper begins to cool in the molds.          

299
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:54,539
a sprayer douses them with water to speed the cooling process,  

300
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,375
and the copper hardens into the anode shape.      

301
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,049
a hydraulic cylinder pops them out of the molds.   

302
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,420
then a carrier system retrieves them          

303
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,557
and takes them for a rinse.   

304
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,825
this gets rid of any traces   

305
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,362
of a nonstick substance applied to the molds earlier   

306
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:22,233
for easy release of the copper slabs.       

307
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,901
hooks formed during the molding             

308
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,770
make it easy to rack up the slabs       

309
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,908
for shipment to a texas refinery hundreds of miles away.     

310
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,110
at the refinery,         

311
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,646
the copper slabs shed any lingering impurities     

312
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,913
in this tank           

313
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,849
as an electrical current is applied.           

314
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,386
the current causes the copper to gravitate           

315
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,987
to thin starter sheets.     

316
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,323
the impurities fall to the bottom.       

317
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,660
the copper deposited on the starter sheets      

318
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:51,395
is 99.99% pure,         

319
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:55,266
the purity level required by wire manufacturers.      

320
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:59,404
they load it into a furnace that's essentially a tall shaft.             

321
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:02,473
midway down, the pure copper melts      

322
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,943
and flows to the bottom of the furnace.         

323
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:09,747
from there, they transfer it  
to an insulated metal channel,  

324
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,282
which keeps it molten      

325
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,219
as it now travels into a vertical mold.      

326
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,689
this mold shapes it into rectangular forms      

327
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,490
known as copper cakes.      

328
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,893
copper cakes are used for manufacturing things     

329
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,596
like copper sheeting and plumbing parts.       

330
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,300
fresh from the mold,       

331
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,903
the copper cakes are roughly 20 feet long.    

332
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,906
a conveyor serves them up to a circular saw        

333
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,209
that slices them to lengths required by the customer.    

334
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:47,519
stacked and labeled, this pure copper cake      

335
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,654
is now ready to ship to the manufacturer.       

336
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,258
they also process pure copper into rods,            

337
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,563
a form more suitable for manufacturing electrical wiring.             

338
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,334
molten copper moves through an opening in a mold,      

339
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,803
and, cooled by water,      

340
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,672
the copper forms a continuous rectangular bar.  

341
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,344
these grooved rollers      

342
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,947
will now take it from rectangular to round    

343
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,483
and reduce the diameter substantially.          

344
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,819
as the copper travels through the grooves,       

345
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:26,157
it becomes a 3/10 of an inch thick copper rod.        

346
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,759
the rod exits,          

347
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,294
and the machine loops it into coils.           

348
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:36,468
they land neatly onto a steel spool.       

349
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,573
machinery compresses the copper coil,         

350
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,907
squeezing it down        

351
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,644
so it will take up less space when it's transported.      

352
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:54,718
there's one last squeeze from an overhead press.     

353
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,323
and an employee ties the tightly coiled copper    

354
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,558
with extra-strong plastic banding.         

355
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,997
from the earth's crust to the factory floor,      

356
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,200
it's been quite a journey.    

357
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,535
shipped to manufacturers,    

358
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,805
it will now be drawn into electrical wiring,     

359
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,342
and the future is sure to be high-voltage.
