00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:55,520
narrator: top hats and bowler hats both originated in england.  

2
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,058
the top hat emerged in the late
1700s as a daring new style,  

3
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,794
radically higher than the flat 3-cornered hat  

4
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,195
men wore at the time.     

5
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,697
then the bowler was invented around 1850,   

6
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,434
as a lower alternative to the top hat.        

7
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,472
today, even women wear bowlers.    

8
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,944
top hats remain, by and large, a masculine fashion statement, 

9
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,612
reserved for formal occasions, 

10
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:22,147
although magicians are still known to use them  

11
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,882
to produce rabbits.      

12
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,351
at the hat factory,      

13
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,554
workers spray a fine mist of water on hoods,       

14
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,823
pre-cut hat forms made of 100% wool felt.    

15
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,960
after the moisture penetrates overnight,     

16
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:36,095
they steam them for about two minutes.     

17
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,365
the moisture and heat deactivate
a chemical stiffener      

18
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,232
in the felt,          

19
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,835
making the material malleable. 

20
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:46,305
then they place the hood in an aluminum top-hat mold,  

21
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,375
which applies heat and pressure simultaneously.  

22
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:53,112
they place a string in a groove
along the perimeter and pull. 

23
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:56,248
this rolls back the edge of the felt to form a rim.    

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,517
then they trim off the excess felt.        

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,054
after about 90 seconds of molding           

26
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:04,790
at approximately 230 degrees fahrenheit,          

27
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,526
they remove the string and open her up.        

28
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,596
the top hat is now dry and fully shaped.       

29
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,399
however, the felt is still malleable.  

30
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,602
so, to re-activate the stiffener
and lock in the shape,     

31
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,672
they set the hat aside for about 30 seconds to cool. 

32
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,940
to make a bowler hat,     

33
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,542
the process up to that point is identical,         

34
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,011
but with a bowler-shaped mold. 

35
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,813
for both hat styles,      

36
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,749
it takes two sets of hands to pull the hood taut     

37
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,616
over the bottom part of the mold,          

38
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,321
to avoid creating pleats or creases.          

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,893
there's a separate mold not just for each hat style,  

40
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,898
but for each size of each style.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,634
after the bowler comes off the mold and cools,      

42
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:53,239
they give it a second, more precise trimming.     

43
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:01,514
both styles are finished the same way.         

44
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,250
first a seamstress takes a wide ribbon,      

45
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,385
folds it over the edge of the hat,          

46
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:10,056
and sews it down on both sides,
encasing the edge.       

47
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,931
another seamstress uses a gold-leaf stamping machine  

48
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,801
to apply the traditional british
milliner's crest        

49
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:25,805
and "made in england" to the hat's lining.      

50
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,809
the lining fabric is a silk/satin blend.     

51
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,479
she sews the stamped top piece to the side piece.       

52
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,415
the machine automatically pleats
at regular intervals,     

53
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:41,420
so the lining will lie flat against the hat's crown.    

54
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,024
bowler hats are more rigid than top hats,         

55
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,026
so they require an extra application of stiffener    

56
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:48,461
inside the crown.       

57
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,299
once the stiffener dries thoroughly,        

58
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,235
which takes the better part of a day,           

59
00:03:56,237 --> 00:04:00,172
the hat is ready to receive its elegant lining.      

60
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:04,977
they attach it with hot glue, which dries almost instantly. 

61
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:12,184
next they cut a strip of leather
to the hat size        

62
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,588
and sew the ends together with a decorative zigzag stitch.  

63
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,057
the leather has been specially treated       

64
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:21,594
to prevent mildew build-up resulting from perspiration.  

65
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,130
they sew this leather band to the inside of the hat,    

66
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,601
at the base of the crown,   
covering the edge of the lining.

67
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,937
not only does this produce a neat and classy finish,    

68
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,140
the leather band also makes  
the hat more comfortable to wear

69
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,408
by cushioning the forehead.  

70
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,015
now it's time to finish the outside of the hat.    

71
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,552
first they hot-glue a cotton ribbon        

72
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,587
around the base of the crown. 

73
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,430
next they glue on a matching bow.        

74
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,314
the grand finale is a small silk/satin bow   

75
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,583
on the interior leather band, 

76
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:20,452
then below that, the manufacturer's label.   

77
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,522
a few taps with the sticky side
of adhesive tape        

78
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,226
easily removes lint, dust,   
and wayward strands of hot glue.

79
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,464
these elegant toppers and bowlers          

80
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,533
are the product of several experienced,          

81
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,202
skilled craftspeople.     

82
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,737
hats off to them.       

83
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,954
narrator: domestic water heaters     

84
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,224
traditionally run on electricity, natural gas,  

85
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:00,358
or oil, for which you have to pay   

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,761
and which have an environmental impact.    

87
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,497
a newer alternative is a solar-energy system.   

88
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,832
it warms water with the heat of the sun,          

89
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,570
a resource that's not only renewable but free of charge. 

90
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,110
solar panels absorb the sun's energy,       

91
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,311
heating water,         

92
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,780
which a pump circulates in a closed loop        

93
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,981
to a heat exchanger.      

94
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,918
the exchanger then transfers the incoming heat       

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,789
to the potable water in the household tank.     

96
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,859
inside the solar panels are copper strips       

97
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,463
electroplated with tin, which absorb the sun's heat.  

98
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,932
the copper surface must be pristine        

99
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,000
for the plating to adhere.   

100
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:46,605
therefore, the first operation is a 3-stage cleaning process. 

101
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,411
tin doesn't adhere directly to copper,           

102
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,613
so they first electroplate with nickel,          

103
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,882
then plate the nickel with tin.

104
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:01,220
the plating is brittle, so to protect it,       

105
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:04,757
the next station sprays on a thin coat of liquid glass.  

106
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,695
the strip then passes through an infrared oven        

107
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,832
that hardens the glass into a durable protective shield.  

108
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,969
as the strip exits the oven,  

109
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,905
a fiber-optic instrument measures reflectivity.     

110
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:24,242
the less reflective the surface,
the better it absorbs heat.  

111
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,512
from there, the strip enters the welding machine      

112
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,582
that fuses it to copper tubing entering from another feeder.  

113
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:36,655
a nozzle sprays cold water onto the mated components,   

114
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,258
still hot from the welding process.   

115
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,493
they're wound onto a giant reel.

116
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,664
the reel feeds a forming machine,       

117
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,868
which uses heavy steel rollers to press ridges into the strip.

118
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,403
this increases the surface area,

119
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,073
meaning it compacts more heat-absorbing metal      

120
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,943
into a given length of strip. 

121
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,745
next, the machine cuts this continuous fin tube,   

122
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,814
as it's now called,      

123
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,283
into the standard-length pieces
required            

124
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,753
to construct the solar panel's internal piping.        

125
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:11,556
then, a piece at a time, it slices 7/10 of an inch   

126
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,493
off each end so the tubing protrudes.    

127
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,396
each solar panel contains 10 fin tubes          

128
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,433
that connect on either side to a header.          

129
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,102
to make each header,      

130
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,907
workers slide an inch-wide copper tube onto a mandrel.  

131
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,911
then they punch 10 holes in the tube,          

132
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,714
one for each fin tube.     

133
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,919
they fit the protruding ends of the fin tubes        

134
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,856
into these holes and weld the connections.   

135
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,928
the finished assembly is called
an absorber plate.       

136
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,332
it's the key component of the solar panel.      

137
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,933
the fins absorb the sun's heat 

138
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,402
and warm the water circulating through the tubes, 

139
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,605
down to the heat exchanger.  

140
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:03,141
they pressure-test the absorber
by submerging it in water   

141
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,410
and injecting air through the tubes.       

142
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:09,014
any bubbles in the water would indicate a leak to be repaired.

143
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,751
now they cover the headers with a decorative trim     

144
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,552
and lay the manifold      

145
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,756
into the solar panel's insulated aluminum housing.  

146
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,425
the front is a sheet of tempered glass       

147
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,163
that allows sunlight to reach the fins inside.   

148
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:26,297
after putting caps on the headers         

149
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,367
to protect them during transport,       

150
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,169
they apply the manufacturer's label.   

151
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,305
the solar panel is finished.  

152
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:36,441
now for the other end of the system --        

153
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,377
the heat exchanger.      

154
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,481
its tank is made of welded stainless steel.   

155
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,851
it has connections for the heat-exchanger pipes  

156
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,920
running to and from the water heater,       

157
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,656
as well as for the pipes running the circulating water 

158
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,660
to and from the solar panels. 

159
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,197
workers install the      
heat-exchanger unit in the tank,

160
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,066
then test it for leaks by filling the tank with water,  

161
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,870
injecting air through the pipes,
and looking for bubbles.    

162
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:07,606
if the unit passes the leak test,         

163
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,276
they drain the water, close the top of the tank,   

164
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,213
and center it in an a.b.s. plastic jacket.   

165
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:17,616
then they inject expanding foam insulation        

166
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,019
into the void between the tank and jacket.      

167
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,756
how does it all work?     

168
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,692
the potable cold water in the home's water heater   

169
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,762
circulates through the loop inside the exchanger.     

170
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,032
it absorbs the heat brought in from the solar panels,     

171
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,568
via a completely separate set of pipes.         

172
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,037
the potable hot water then exits the exchanger    

173
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,207
and returns to the water tank. 

174
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,389
narrator: eat one of these,       

175
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,459
and you'll be sure to find yourself in a sticky situation.

176
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,395
but no worries -- it's all ooey-gooey fun.    

177
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,931
a sticky bun is all about messy eating.   

178
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,602
consuming one is a lip-smacking,
finger-licking experience --  

179
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,038
no utensils required.     

180
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,545
sticky buns are sometimes called schnecken,       

181
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,014
due to their german origins.  

182
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:25,417
"schnecken" is the german word for snails,          

183
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,820
which the cinnamon swirl on top resembles.       

184
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:32,758
they start with all-purpose flour,    

185
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,493
then blend in a pre-mix of sugar, salt,        

186
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,895
and baking powder.       

187
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,631
cream cheese and butter come next.     

188
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,967
these fats are just the right consistency   

189
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,703
for an automated dough hook to efficiently work them    

190
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,238
into the dry ingredients.   

191
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,575
an employee then pours milk into the blender.       

192
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,443
it binds the ingredients,   

193
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,712
turning the mix into biscuit dough.      

194
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,516
the dough needs to stay cool for food-safety reasons,    

195
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,718
so they monitor the temperature.

196
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,921
the next worker loads the dough
into an extruder        

197
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,524
that squeezes it into a wide, flat strip    

198
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,059
called the dough band.     

199
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,594
the dough band rides a conveyor

200
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,529
that slopes down to a narrow channel.      

201
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,064
as it enters,         

202
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,001
the dough folds over from the sides, creating two layers.

203
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:22,074
a roller squeezes the layers thinner.      

204
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,543
a device called the fanner now zigzags back and forth   

205
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,680
to layer the dough, ribbon-style.         

206
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,415
the layers pile up six deep.  

207
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,284
and because they were originally
two layers,          

208
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,087
there are now 12 in total.   

209
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,156
metal rollers press the pack down      

210
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,825
and thin it substantially   

211
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,728
until it's about 2/10 of an inch thick.     

212
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,300
next up is the sticky-bun filling,   

213
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,768
called cinnamon schmear.    

214
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,706
it starts with blocks of butter
and lots of ground cinnamon.  

215
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,442
they add brown sugar instead of white.       

216
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,845
it has an intense molasses flavor        

217
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:03,448
and is stickier than white sugar.       

218
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,652
canola oil loosens       
and homogenizes the ingredients,

219
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:11,055
transforming the mix into the sugary cinnamon paste   

220
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,491
known as the schmear.     

221
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,260
this cinnamon schmear is the consistency       

222
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,462
of cake frosting,       

223
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,332
so it can be easily pumped over to the dough.       

224
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,739
a series of nozzles deposit dollops of the cinnamon schmear

225
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,541
onto the sticky-bun dough.   

226
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,544
the dough travels under a long blade       

227
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,346
that spreads the cinnamon schmear evenly.  

228
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,882
a device called a plow     

229
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:40,419
then lifts the outside edges and folds them over.      

230
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,022
rollers press down the curled edges to tighten them.     

231
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,424
each tightly curled edge    

232
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,759
will now become the center of a sticky-bun roll.     

233
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,696
angled rollers called rollwinders       

234
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,832
pick up the curled edges of the dough          

235
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,368
and fold it into two parallel cinnamon rolls.        

236
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,374
a guillotine blade slices the parallel rolls into buns, 

237
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,377
creating sets of two.     

238
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,913
meanwhile, the sweet and sticky topping  

239
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,515
is bubbling away in a big kettle.        

240
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,718
it's made of honey, brown sugar, and butter.    

241
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,355
this topping actually goes on the bottom of the baking tray. 

242
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,591
they pump it into the container

243
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,793
and then toss in pecans to give it some crunch.    

244
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,797
putting the topping      
on the bottom of the baking tray

245
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,199
means, of course,       

246
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,468
that these sticky buns are to be baked upside down,  

247
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,804
once purchased by the consumer.

248
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:35,540
it's a strategic baking technique.       

249
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,008
cooked upside down,      

250
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,179
the sticky topping will saturate
the buns for added moisture.  

251
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,283
and by not exposing the topping to direct heat,  

252
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,854
it won't burn as it caramelizes
into a sugary glaze.      

253
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,695
the sticky buns now head into a tunnel         

254
00:14:56,697 --> 00:15:00,432
chilled by liquid nitrogen for a very fast freeze.    

255
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,167
after about four minutes,   

256
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,304
the buns emerge frozen solid, with the freshness locked in. 

257
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,309
the sticky buns then ride another conveyor        

258
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,444
to the wrapping station.    

259
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,847
here, machinery quickly seals plastic film          

260
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,849
around each box of buns,    

261
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:22,320
after which it's into an oven to heat-shrink the plastic.  

262
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,523
it all happens in seconds,   

263
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,059
giving the frozen buns no time to thaw.        

264
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,462
it has taken hours of prep work
at the factory,        

265
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,933
but these frozen sticky buns are ready for baking.     

266
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,069
all the cook has to do is pop the tray in the oven,  

267
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,739
and the buns will be ready in 20 minutes.         

268
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,876
no need to get your hands sticky
by making them from scratch.  

269
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,426
narrator: electrostatic speakers     

270
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,095
added a whole new vibe to the home-music scene.    

271
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,364
unlike traditional box speakers,

272
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,834
electrostatic speakers are usually tall and skinny.  

273
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,569
and instead of using an electromagnet        

274
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,970
to produce sound,       

275
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,374
they rely on conductive layers of plastic and metal.     

276
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,982
electrostatic speakers generate rich audio      

277
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,317
in the high- and mid-frequency range,    

278
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,185
but they lack the thumping bass

279
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,388
needed for full sound reproduction.      

280
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,527
to compensate, most are now equipped with a woofer.    

281
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,795
to make the woofer,      

282
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,530
a computer-driven router cuts out cabinetry parts    

283
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,633
from veneered mdf.       

284
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,871
the router carves long grooves.

285
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,874
they'll be used to fold it into the woofer box.      

286
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:55,346
it also cuts out holes for a speaker cone and hardware.  

287
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,083
a worker glues and drills screws
into the bottom of the cabinetry

288
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,219
for installing the speaker feet.

289
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,892
he trims the excess      

290
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,529
from the edges of the cabinetry panel.    

291
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,900
he beads high-strength glue along the joints        

292
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,237
and folds the grooved panel to create the cabinet box.   

293
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,439
the glue is stronger than screws

294
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:25,109
and acts as a kind of cement to hold the cabinet together. 

295
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:29,014
he sands the wood veneer at the joints for a seamless look.

296
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,385
and now it's into the spray booth        

297
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,719
for the finishing touch --   

298
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,724
a dark, glossy varnish     
that accentuates the wood grain.

299
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,528
once the paint dries, a technician pads the inside  

300
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,397
with a poly-cotton baffle to reduce resonance.      

301
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,266
he then installs the crossover unit.      

302
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,269
it splits the audio signal to send low notes to the woofer

303
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:55,139
and the rest to the electrostatic panel.    

304
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,608
next up is the power supply  

305
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,746
and a step-up transformer for boosting the amplifier signal. 

306
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:06,651
he attaches the assembly to  
the interior wall of the woofer.

307
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:13,224
he now wires the speaker cone to the crossover unit.     

308
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,027
he inserts the cone in the slot machined for it,  

309
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,295
and it's a perfect fit.    

310
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,168
he boosts the bass with the built-in amplifier.  

311
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,769
he wires it to the crossover  

312
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,972
and pops it into the back of the woofer box.       

313
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,174
this woofer is now ready    

314
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,176
to be paired up with its electrostatic mate.    

315
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:34,112
they make the electrostatic speaker   

316
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,114
from two perforated metal panels.         

317
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:40,317
a technician applies a charge 
to them to check for thin spots.

318
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,588
next she bends each one to a 30-degree curve.     

319
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,126
this will allow sound to be  
more widely dispersed in a room.

320
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,595
she presses heavy-duty double-sided tape       

321
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,930
on to the edges        

322
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:55,800
and applies rigid plastic   
strips, called spars, crosswise.

323
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:01,006
they stiffen the panels to withstand electrostatic forces.

324
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:04,542
she now unfurls thin but super-tough plastic    

325
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,946
and stretches it to a precise tension.     

326
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,481
this plastic is the speaker diaphragm.     

327
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,417
it's been impregnated with a conductive coating   

328
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,419
to respond to an electrical charge.    

329
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,423
she positions one of the perforated panels     

330
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,824
under the diaphragm.      

331
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,761
and with the backing of the adhesive tape removed, 

332
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:26,164
she jacks up the table to press
the panel to the plastic.   

333
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,034
she attaches wiring that will deliver the charge  

334
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:33,038
to the diaphragm and make it vibrate.      

335
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,772
she applies more double-sided tape       

336
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,841
to the other side of the diaphragm        

337
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,309
and peels off the backing.   

338
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,712
workers position the second speaker panel on the diaphragm 

339
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:45,717
and align its fine mesh with that of the panel below. 

340
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:49,654
they place the speaker sandwich
in a metal capsule       

341
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,389
to vacuum-press it together.  

342
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,526
they then frame the speaker with an aluminum border    

343
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,529
and add a strut to the middle for reinforcement.       

344
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,732
and now it's time for the electrostatic speaker   

345
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,600
to be joined to the woofer.  

346
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,669
the tall, slim electrostatic speaker     

347
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,072
will deliver the high and mid frequencies.      

348
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:11,609
the short, boxy woofer will thump out the bass.    

349
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,945
then it's into the test booth 

350
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,947
to confirm that the speaker has the correct range.     

351
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,816
the technician runs an audio-tone sweep      

352
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,220
and checks for any dropouts in the frequency.       

353
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,554
using a special tool,     

354
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,358
he verifies that the sound waves
of the speaker set are in sync, 

355
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,228
a process called phasing.   

356
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,497
he then places the speaker in a padded room        

357
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,398
to test a full range of tones. 

358
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,502
[ tones pulsing ]       

359
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,638
a computer analyzes the tones. 

360
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,509
once it passes all the tests, 

361
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,311
this electrostatic speaker links up            

362
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,313
with the rest of the sound system.      

363
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,249
it's now ready for its audience.
