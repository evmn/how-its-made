00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,522
            narrator:           
          gas barbecues         

4
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,325
   were invented in the 1960s   
   by an arkansas gas company.  

5
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:05,063
they redesigned a charcoal grill
   to run on bottled propane.   

6
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,599
        people were drawn       
      to the instant flame,     

7
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,969
      and the gas barbecue      
     became a hot commodity.    

8
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:27,752
  gas barbecues run from basic  
     to extremely high-end.     

9
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,155
       there's no fussing       
    with charcoal briquettes.   

10
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,157
            you just            
    press the starter button    

11
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,827
      and adjust the flame      
    to the desired intensity.   

12
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,064
       then close the lid,      
  and you're cooking with gas.  

13
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:46,371
      making a gas barbecue     
      begins with a laser.      

14
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,840
it cuts holes for screws, knobs,

15
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,510
     and piping into a sheet    
      of high-gauge steel.      

16
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,913
          it will take          
  approximately 50 steel sheets 

17
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,517
to make the entire gas barbecue.

18
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,753
     this sheet will be used    
   for the grill's front hood.  

19
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,724
       computerized tools       

20
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,394
    punch out various holes     
    in the next steel sheet.    

21
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,431
         it will be used        
  to make the barbecue's cart.  

22
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,135
            the holes           
    are strategically placed    

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,739
  for vents and other features. 

24
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,140
     once holes are punched,    

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,544
  the team transfers the sheet  
        to a press brake.       

26
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,079
 they place it between the jaws 

27
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,882
           repeatedly           
     to make numerous bends.    

28
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,255
  the first set of bends create 
a ledge for the grill to sit on.

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,629
    other bends transform the   
flat sheet into a three-wall box

30
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,564
         that will serve        
      as the back and sides     

31
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,767
     of the barbecue's cart.    

32
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,904
the next employee places a sheet
  within the walls of the box.  

33
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,908
   this will serve as the base  
     of the barbecue's cart.    

34
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,445
     he clamps cross braces     
           to the cart          

35
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,481
  and welds the parts together. 

36
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,153
        the barbecue cart       
        has taken shape.        

37
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,258
           they return          
    to the front hood piece.    

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,128
        it's been rounded       
      since we last saw it.     

39
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,332
     a worker assembles two     
 steel side panels to the hood. 

40
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,600
         the side panels        
    are made of thicker steel   

41
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,402
  than the rest of the barbecue 

42
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,906
     because they will need     
 to support hinges and springs. 

43
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,278
       an employee presses      
          a belt sander         

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,815
    against the welded seams    
        to clean them up.       

45
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,417
then he sands the entire surface
           of the hood          

46
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,553
  so that the seams disappear.  

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,891
he inserts the temperature gauge

48
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,361
   and secures it to the hood   
        from the inside.        

49
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,364
   down the line, another team  
   member joins the rear part   

50
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,968
           of the hood          
  with the barbecue's firebox.  

51
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,369
           he installs          
    the gas manifold system,    

52
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,572
      complete with valves      
    that control the burners.   

53
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,041
    he hooks up the gas line    

54
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:07,112
         that will fuel         
   the barbecue's rotisserie.   

55
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,446
     he covers the manifold     

56
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,316
          with a plate          
 that has holes for the valves. 

57
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,923
   he places infrared ceramic   
   burners inside the firebox.  

58
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,497
 he connects the ignitor system 
for lighting the gas barbecue...

59
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,306
         ...and fastens         
    all the cables together.    

60
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,679
  now he fires up the barbecue  

61
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:45,883
  and inspects it for leaks or  
 any other operational problems.

62
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,486
       once the barbecue        
       passes inspection,       

63
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,224
  the employee mounts a glossy  
    steel panel to the front.   

64
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:56,761
       he attaches a knob       
   to the end of the ignitor.   

65
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,299
   he installs stainless-steel  
    grates above the burners.   

66
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,404
    he hinges the front hood    
        to the back one.        

67
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,642
   once the hinges have been    
   secured, he lowers the lid   

68
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,079
       to confirm that it       
closes tightly over the firebox.

69
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,051
 the team transfers the barbecue
          to the cart.          

70
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,088
   the cart has been equipped   
     with doors and drawers.    

71
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,259
   after they weld the firebox  
          to the cart,          

72
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:31,563
 this gas barbecue is on its way
      to a patio near you.      

73
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,801
     15 hours in the making,    

74
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,804
      it will provide years     
      of grilling pleasure.     

75
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,674
        no need to slave        
over a hot stove in the kitchen.

76
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,511
     just turn on the grill     
  and enjoy the great outdoors. 

77
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,825
            narrator:           
     a mattress pad protects    

78
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:04,296
    and preserves a mattress,   
 ensuring that it lasts longer. 

79
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,164
   quilted with plush filling,  

80
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,567
         a mattress pad         
 can also provide an extra layer

81
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,703
      of comfort for those      
  who prefer a softer mattress. 

82
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,780
    purchasing a comfortable    
    mattress is an investment   

83
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,915
    in a good night's sleep.    

84
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,052
         a mattress pad         
  can protect that investment.  

85
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,130
 to manufacture a mattress pad, 

86
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,800
    a crew first cuts straps    
 to keep the fibers compressed. 

87
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,003
    then they feed the clumps   
 of fibers into a revolving drum

88
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,806
       with steel spikes.       

89
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,810
 the spikes fluff up the fibers.

90
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,812
     this starts the process    
           of opening           

91
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:57,949
   and separating the strands.  

92
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:01,553
     fans propel the fibers     
 through ductwork in the ceiling

93
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,757
       and into a chamber       
    where they tumble around.   

94
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,559
          this process          
      introduces more air,      

95
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,027
 further separating the fibers. 

96
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,431
    it also helps mix the new   
  and recycled fibers together  

97
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,667
    with a polyester binder.    

98
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,377
    next, rollers with small    
  metal teeth align the fibers. 

99
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,312
 two streams of combined fibers 

100
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,515
    merge and enter a machine   
      called a crosslapper.     

101
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:37,022
  here carriages lay the fibers 
  perpendicular to each other.  

102
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,594
 multiple layers of crisscrossed
       fibers accumulate,       

103
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,297
            creating            
   a thick pile of polyester.   

104
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,668
        rollers compress        
    the layers of polyester,    

105
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,271
        then the padding        
   travels through a long oven  

106
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:58,944
          that's heated         
   to just under 400 degrees.   

107
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:03,448
  the heat activates the binder 
and unites the polyester fibers.

108
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:11,823
  the polyester exits the oven  
 and is taken up by a big spool.

109
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,226
       in the next stage,       
  the polyester wadding unrolls 

110
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,296
   and travels between sheets   
       of embossed fabric.      

111
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,570
        at the same time,       
 thread unwinds from 22 bobbins.

112
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,843
the thread and polyester wadding
  head into a quilting machine. 

113
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,583
         here 22 needles        
      chain-stitch a design     

114
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,353
         into the fabric        
     and polyester wadding.     

115
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,860
  the stitching creates pockets 
 that hold the filling in place.

116
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,329
    without it, the stuffing    

117
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,032
       would slide around       
  between the sheets of fabric. 

118
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,339
        a circular blade        
    slices the quilted fabric   

119
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,742
    to a width of 60 inches,    

120
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,545
          the standard          
   for a queen-size mattress.   

121
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,922
 the edges of the quilted layers
  are left open for inspection. 

122
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,294
      at the next station,      
      fabric for the skirt      

123
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,964
      unwinds into a large,     
    automated sewing machine.   

124
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,833
 it pulls elastic threads tight 

125
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,770
         as it sews them        
    into the nylon material,    

126
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,106
   creating a ribbed pattern.   

127
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,843
      this turns the fabric     
    into a stretchy material.   

128
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,448
          a seamstress          
 stitches the stretchy material 

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,384
   to the quilted rectangles.   

130
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,586
            she uses            
  an industrial sewing machine  

131
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,289
    that trims excess fabric    
           as it sews.          

132
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,665
      she also sews a label     
         into the seam.         

133
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,800
           it contains          
    manufacturing information   

134
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,769
    and washing instructions.   

135
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,009
     these overlock stitches    
    will encapsulate the seam   

136
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,545
       so that the fabric       
       will not unravel.        

137
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,282
      she trims the bottom      
      of the skirt by hand      

138
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,019
          and hems it.          

139
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,221
  the mattress pad is complete  

140
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,557
          and ready for         
 the quality control department.

141
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,761
  here an employee does random  
   checks of the workmanship.   

142
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,565
 he examines the fit of the pad 
          to a mattress         

143
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,500
 and looks for missing stitches 
           or defects.          

144
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,904
       with his approval,       

145
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:44,442
        the mattress pad        
 is ready to leave the factory. 

146
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,913
  it takes about 30 minutes to  
make one of these mattress pads.

147
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,683
     with the job complete,     
         it's nap time.         

148
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,797
 narrator: a prosthesis can help
 restore the physical appearance

149
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,067
 of a person who has lost a part
  of their face to an accident  

150
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,635
           or illness.          

151
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,805
   everyone's face is unique,   

152
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,942
    so the prosthesis must be   
 custom-designed for the patient

153
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,111
     by an anaplastologist.     

154
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,351
    anaplastologists combine    
      anatomical knowledge,     

155
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,554
        technical skill,        
      and artistic talent.      

156
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,156
         they can create        
    an artificial ear, nose,    

157
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,359
             or eye             
that looks remarkably realistic.

158
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,297
      entirely custom-made,     
the prosthesis blends seamlessly

159
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,233
       with the patient's       
         skin coloring.         

160
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,837
   the prosthesis is durable,   
 easy for the patient to apply, 

161
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,773
    and comfortable to wear.    

162
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,177
       to securely attach       
 an ear prosthesis to a patient,

163
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,979
            surgeons            
    implant titanium fixtures   

164
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,849
          into the bone         
      around the ear area.      

165
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,251
       once bone has grown      
        over the implant,       

166
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,321
       the anaplastologist      
     attaches metal markers     

167
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:08,593
called impression copings to the
  titanium implants' abutments. 

168
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,462
          these markers         
 register the abutment locations

169
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,533
 in the impression the surgeon  
 will now take of the ear area. 

170
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,002
          the material          
 she is using for the impression

171
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:22,607
  is the same material dentists 
  use to make models of teeth.  

172
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,944
        she then attaches       
abutment replicas to the copings

173
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,445
        with guide pins.        

174
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,017
       after taking photos      
   of the patient's other ear,  

175
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,488
  the surgeon sends the patient 
   home and begins the process  

176
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,225
    of making a plaster model   
    of the missing ear area.    

177
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:45,162
      she mixes the plaster     
and vacuums out any air pockets.

178
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,299
    this is to prevent holes    
  from appearing in the plaster 

179
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,934
          once it sets.         

180
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,107
    next, she gently presses    
    the ear-area impression     

181
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,311
 that she took from the patient 
        into the plaster.       

182
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,247
    once the plaster hardens,   

183
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,849
   she unscrews the guide pins  
          that connect          

184
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,186
  the implant abutment replicas 
   to the impression copings.   

185
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,988
then she removes the impression.

186
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,125
   she now has a plaster model  
   of the patient's ear area.   

187
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,461
      she sends this model      
    to an outside laboratory.   

188
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,864
        the lab produces        
        a solid gold bar        

189
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,201
      that is custom-fitted     
    to the abutment replicas.   

190
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,804
     she screws the gold bar    
   into the abutment replicas,  

191
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,073
      then fills in the gap     
      between the gold bar      

192
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:33,744
      in the plaster model      
        with heated wax.        

193
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,481
  this will create an air space 
        in the prosthesis       

194
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,283
      so the patient's skin     
          can breathe.          

195
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,753
    she traces the impression   
  on the plaster with a pencil  

196
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:47,625
    and bends a strip of wax    
     along the pencil line.     

197
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,961
         then she fills         
     the wax-enclosed shape     

198
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,963
   with flesh-colored acrylic.  

199
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,502
        it takes an hour        
  for the acrylic to solidify.  

200
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,173
    she removes the wax strip   

201
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,909
           and shaves           
     off any excess acrylic,    

202
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:07,845
  then cleans the newly formed  
         acrylic plate.         

203
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,849
 it will form the rigid internal
  structure of the prosthesis.  

204
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,786
        she drills holes        
for attaching the prosthetic ear

205
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,921
    and installs tiny clips.    

206
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:20,859
  these clips allow the acrylic 
 plate to snap onto the gold bar

207
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,827
  that is on the patient's ear. 

208
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,469
 now comes the artistic part -- 

209
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,741
    designing a wax prototype   
     of the prosthetic ear.     

210
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:40,411
       the anaplastologist      
places the acrylic plate and bar

211
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:44,015
     onto the plaster model     
   of the patient's ear area.   

212
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,751
    with fine sculpting tools   
        and her fingers,        

213
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,420
 she begins sculpting a wax ear.

214
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,360
    she refers to photographs   
  of the patient's existing ear 

215
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,829
             to try             
   to sculpt a perfect match.   

216
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,770
   sculpting the wax prototype  
     can take an entire day.    

217
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,171
        when she's done,        

218
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,708
    she carefully removes the   
 wax ear from the plaster model.

219
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,678
        the acrylic plate       
      is now lodged inside.     

220
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,450
       the patient returns      
    for his next appointment.   

221
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:23,187
    here the anaplastologist    
   snaps on the wax prototype   

222
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,523
         and compares it        
 to the patient's existing ear. 

223
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,994
she makes whatever modifications
are required to perfect the fit 

224
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,797
         and appearance.        

225
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,534
 this sculpting process can take
 two or three hours to complete,

226
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,604
and the patient must be present.

227
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,340
    once the anaplastologist    
is satisfied with the prototype,

228
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,010
  she conducts a comprehensive  
        final inspection        

229
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,612
        from every angle.       

230
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:57,422
  then she moves on to the last 
  phase using the wax prototype 

231
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,058
             to make            
   a silicone prosthetic ear.   

232
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,235
  narrator: a prosthetic ear is 
 made of medical-grade silicone.

233
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,238
   the material can be molded   
         into any shape         

234
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,974
           and colored          
     to match any skin tone.    

235
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,845
it does not react to temperature
  change or irritate the skin,  

236
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,247
            allowing            
for a natural-looking prosthesis

237
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,249
   that's comfortable to wear.  

238
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,788
             to cast            
   a silicone prosthetic ear,   

239
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,058
       the anaplastologist      
    makes a three-part mold.    

240
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,461
         she reattaches         
      the wax prototype ear     

241
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,597
      to the plaster model      
   of the patient's ear area.   

242
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:44,402
  then she tops the combination 
  with colored dental plaster.  

243
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,137
     once the plaster sets,     

244
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,139
    she transfers everything    
    into a taller container     

245
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,742
          and pours in          
      more dental plaster.      

246
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,413
    once that sets, she pours   
   boiling water over the mold  

247
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,483
    to melt the wax prototype   
         that is inside.        

248
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,485
this leaves an ear-shaped cavity

249
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:05,356
         in what is now         
   a three-part plaster mold.   

250
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,558
         next, she mixes        
        one to two ounces       

251
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,561
    of medical-grade silicone   
        with a catalyst.        

252
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,766
  she removes a small quantity  

253
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,636
 and mixes it with opaque powder
        in a separate cup       

254
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,671
  to make it less transparent.  

255
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,510
         then she mixes         
       this opaque mixture      

256
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,579
 with the rest of the silicone. 

257
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,515
        at the patient's        
        next appointment,       

258
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,850
       the anaplastologist      
       colors the silicone      

259
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,452
     to match his skin tone.    

260
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,522
     she works with an array    

261
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,460
       of pigment powders       
   diluted in silicone fluid.   

262
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,063
         the first step         
   is to produce a base color   

263
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,867
     that's a perfect match     
  to the patient's complexion.  

264
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,737
    there's no exact formula    
         for doing this.        

265
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,674
  it requires an artist's eye.  

266
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,010
      she needs the patient     
        right beside her        

267
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,280
    so she can check samples    
        against his skin.       

268
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,950
          once she has          
     the overall base color,    

269
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,221
  she transfers a small amount  
       to a separate cup,       

270
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:13,124
    adds a drop of thickener,   
           and mixes.           

271
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,896
        then she chooses        
     from her color palette     

272
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:22,500
 to produce a few deeper shades.

273
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:27,505
            every ear           
  has natural color variations. 

274
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,573
      so for the prosthesis     
          to look real,         

275
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,776
   it has to have variations,   
            as well.            

276
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,112
she uses the patient's other ear

277
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,315
         to match these         
   more pronounced skin tones.  

278
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,050
 once all the colors are ready, 

279
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:44,255
  she applies the deeper tones  
  in specific areas of the ear. 

280
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,194
    next, to simulate veins,    

281
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,698
           she applies          
  a few fine, red rayon fibers. 

282
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,336
           she repeats          
      this coloring process     

283
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,406
          for the back          
      of the silicone ear.      

284
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,276
    then she puts that part,    
  along with the acrylic plate, 

285
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,012
      on the plaster model      
        of the ear area.        

286
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,552
       she fills a syringe      
        with a base color       

287
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,955
         and injects it         
      into the mold cavity.     

288
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,697
she completely fills the cavity,
getting every nook and cranny...

289
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,874
 ...then closes the mold firmly.

290
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,153
         she wipes away         
     any excess silicone...     

291
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,891
       ...clamps the mold       
      tightly in a press...     

292
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,730
      ...and puts the press     
           in an oven.          

293
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,469
   the oven cures the silicone  
           for 2 hours          

294
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,672
      at about 200 degrees.     

295
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,213
      once the mold cools       
      to room temperature,      

296
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,717
    she opens it and extracts   
  the finished prosthetic ear.  

297
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:31,629
     it's identical in shape    
      to the wax prototype      

298
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,232
 and looks remarkably realistic.

299
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,836
      the patient returns       
      for his final visit.      

300
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,439
 she snaps on the prosthesis... 

301
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:48,779
and checks that the edges adhere
  well to the surrounding skin. 

302
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:53,584
  the life-span of a prosthetic 
ear depends on how it's handled.

303
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,853
          sun exposure          
    can wear out the silicone   

304
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,722
      or fade its coloring.     

305
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,793
   a patient typically returns  
      for a new prosthesis      

306
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,962
    every two to four years.
