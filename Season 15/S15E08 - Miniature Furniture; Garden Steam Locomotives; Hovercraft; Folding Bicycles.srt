1
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,587
  narrator: selecting furniture 
      is a matter of scale,     

2
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,056
         especially when        
     it's a dollhouse room.     

3
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,593
  miniature furniture is sized  
    for really small spaces.    

4
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,196
     a popular scale is 1/12    
   of full-sized furnishings.   

5
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,465
           but as far           
     as attention to detail,    

6
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:10,169
  there's no need to scale down 
       one's expectations.      

7
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,674
       these are replicas       
     of full-sized antiques,    

8
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,210
       meticulously copied      
          in miniature.         

9
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,880
    this grandfather clock is   
 modeled on an 18th-century one,

10
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:25,418
     and for the craftsman,     
     no detail is too small.    

11
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,353
        he first measures       
  and cuts numerous components  

12
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,889
      from pear-tree wood.      

13
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:33,025
     this wood's small grain    
        scales down well        

14
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:36,695
   to make the miniature clock  
      look more authentic.      

15
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,965
     the parts are too thin     
       and small to nail,       

16
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,967
   so he glues them together,   

17
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,636
    beginning with the front    
      of the clock's trunk.     

18
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,239
  he applies the glue sparingly 
     with a tiny brass tool     

19
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,377
   to prevent messy overflow.   

20
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:57,116
      he installs the sides     
on the front of the clock trunk.

21
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,384
           and he adds          

22
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:01,053
      a substantial-looking     
         pearwood base.         

23
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,859
    he spiffs up the front of   
  the base with veneer paneling 

24
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,329
   that's protected by a layer  
        of tape for now.        

25
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,130
    he carves angles and trim   

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:17,002
      to make it fit neatly     
      around the paneling.      

27
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,604
   he now peels away the tape   

28
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,207
   to reveal the swirled burl   
       of the veneer wood,      

29
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,476
which has been cut from the root
     of a south-asian tree.     

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,879
      he rubs the paneling      
        against sandpaper       

31
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:31,283
to smooth its surface and expose
     more of the wood grain.    

32
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,086
       once the feet have       
  been installed on the clock,  

33
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,889
  he applies a strip of molding 
        above the trunk.        

34
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,891
        the crisp profile       
      of this limewood trim     

35
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,093
       is a classic touch.      

36
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,829
      carving a mini gable      
with the thin blade of a fretsaw

37
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,966
      is tricky, especially     
   with this intricate design,  

38
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,901
       called a swan neck.      

39
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,104
       he sands the edges       
     to finish off the job.     

40
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:56,174
   the swan-neck gable is one   
 of numerous little parts that, 

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,111
      when pieced together,     
   form the hood of the clock,  

42
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:02,247
      which holds the face      
         and clockworks.        

43
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,050
 he joins the hood to the trunk,

44
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,786
  and with the basic structure  
          now complete,         

45
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:10,723
  he glues a tiny wooden crest  
 to the center of the swan neck.

46
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,461
          he tapers it          
    with a surgical scalpel.    

47
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,931
    after staining the clock    
    a deep antique mahogany,    

48
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,768
   he sands it to make it look  
         more authentic.        

49
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,939
    he then brushes on coats    
       of shellac sealer.       

50
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,675
    it both protects the wood   

51
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,179
  and provides a smooth surface 
      for the next finish.      

52
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,350
     after the sealer dries,    
      he sands it a little      

53
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:42,087
   and then applies two coats   
  of traditional french polish. 

54
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,822
 this mix of alcohol and shellac

55
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,493
      gives the cabinetry       
      a high-gloss finish.      

56
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:52,398
once it dries, he buffs the wood
 with wax to enhance the sheen. 

57
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,903
         the clock door         
     with its exotic veneer     

58
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,673
   is also stained, polished,   
           and waxed.           

59
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,644
      then, using tweezers,     

60
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:09,081
 he positions tiny brass hinges 
          on the door.          

61
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,522
  he presses little brass pins  
     into holes in the hinge    

62
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,724
    to secure it to the door.   

63
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,263
      he files the pinheads     
 until their flush to the hinge.

64
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:28,334
    he now dips the pendulum    
    and its weights in acid,    

65
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:32,604
        which gives them        
       an antiqued finish.      

66
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:36,275
    he installs them in their   
  compartment in the cabinetry. 

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,880
he now sets the clock upright...

68
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,351
and paints the back basic black.

69
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:49,555
       he inserts a piece       
        of clear acrylic        

70
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,824
        into the opening        
       of the clock hood.       

71
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,827
 acrylic has a slight wave to it
   that looks like old glass.   

72
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,294
    this small watch movement   

73
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,364
is what will make this miniature
     grandfather clock tick.    

74
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,901
    using double-sided tape,    
   he attaches it to the dial.  

75
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,838
      he fastens the hands      
    to the clockwork shafts,    

76
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
   and then he lowers the dial  
         and clockworks         

77
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,608
   into the hood compartment.   

78
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,714
        he signs the back       
     with a paint-filled pen    

79
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,782
    which makes his signature   
            stand out           

80
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,252
  against the black background. 

81
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:25,324
  and finally, he glues a tiny  
   tassel to the door handle.   

82
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,527
      including drying time     
    for the various finishes,   

83
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,396
  it has taken over three days  

84
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,798
     to make this miniature     
       grandfather clock.       

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,601
        no small effort,        
   but it's the little details  

86
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,872
     that make a difference     
        in a small space.       

87
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,622
    narrator: it's out of the   
 basement and into the backyard 

88
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,023
    for the model train set.    

89
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,358
           this trend           
  is called garden railroading, 

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,829
  and it merges two hobbies --  
  gardening and model trains.   

91
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,498
    these outdoor train sets    
        are often larger        

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,834
         and more rugged        
        than indoor ones,       

93
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,938
    so people can hop aboard    
  for a tour of the perennials. 

94
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,910
 these garden-variety train sets

95
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:21,446
 have become the fastest-growing
  segment of model railroading. 

96
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:24,516
      people design gardens     
  to the scale of these trains  

97
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,986
to provide the perfect backdrop.

98
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,721
   this particular locomotive   

99
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:34,726
    is a quarter of the size    
  of the 19th-century original. 

100
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,930
            it starts           
     with a sheet of copper,    

101
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:41,000
   cut to precise measurements  
    with a guillotine blade.    

102
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,738
     an employee then turns     
     the crank of a machine     

103
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,274
        to curl the sheet       
     into a cylinder shape.     

104
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,209
          this cylinder         
    will serve as the barrel    

105
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,346
 or outer casing of the boiler. 

106
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:59,284
  the next worker assembles the 
  boiler's internal components. 

107
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,620
       he groups together       
      numerous copper tubes     

108
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,022
         and welds them         
     to a firebox at one end    

109
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,958
and a copper plate at the other.

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,261
         he's now ready         
     to enclose the firebox.    

111
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,898
 he installs it on a base plate 

112
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,167
         and then builds        
  a protective shell around it. 

113
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,238
 he then encases the heat tubes 
         in the barrel.         

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,574
          these boilers         
     come in various sizes,     

115
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,912
     depending on the scale     
  of the locomotive being made. 

116
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:31,383
  next, a lathe spins as tools  
   contour a bronze cylinder.   

117
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,452
  this sizes it to fit a piston 

118
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,321
  that sets the steam engine's  
        wheels in motion.       

119
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:40,559
the cylinder on the right is the
 one that's just been machined. 

120
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:45,264
more tools transform basic steel
  disks into the train wheels.  

121
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,267
      they make four wheels     
         per locomotive.        

122
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,406
    the next worker inserts     
    a pre-cut sheet of steel    

123
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,542
        in a device that,       
         when activated,        

124
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,810
     bends it in two places.    

125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,347
       the folding action       
        shapes the sheet        

126
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,350
    into the locomotive cab.    

127
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:09,154
 then it's into the paint booth 
 for seven coats of epoxy paint.

128
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:14,426
 this gives this model train cab
       a heavy-duty gloss.      

129
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:17,429
       with a steady hand,      

130
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,631
      a painter now applies     
          plastic tape          

131
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,433
 around the perimeter of the cab

132
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,502
            to create           
    a kind of linear stencil.   

133
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,972
 he arcs the tape at the corners
       to soften the look.      

134
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,575
       and then he brushes      
  two coats of oil-based paint  

135
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,711
     into the tape stencil.     

136
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:36,849
      he allows three days      
      for each coat to dry.     

137
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,917
   then he peels off the tape   

138
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,055
to reveal the crisp, clean lines
     that now frame the cab.    

139
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,991
      he adds black border      
        next to the white       

140
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:50,662
       to give more depth       
    to this custom paint job.   

141
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,732
  they carve a piece of bronze  
          into a valve          

142
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,735
  to control the flow of steam  
         to the piston.         

143
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,207
  they assemble the locomotive  
      chassis and paint it.     

144
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,475
     they install the wheels    

145
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,611
    and the network of pipes    
 and parts that make them turn. 

146
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,080
     they run compressed air    
       through the system       

147
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,016
  to confirm everything works.  

148
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,952
  the worker adds a little oil  
     to lubricate the wheels    

149
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,355
   and the rest of the parts.   

150
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,957
 he then opens the steam chamber

151
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,226
            to check            
  the valve-and-piston action,  

152
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,696
   which is the driving force   
   of this steam locomotive.    

153
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,999
      he pulls the forward      
        and reverse lever       

154
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,635
   to confirm that the wheels   
     run in both directions.    

155
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:35,440
     he applies the brakes,     
 and the wheels grind to a halt.

156
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,443
       now that everything      
 on the chassis is checked out, 

157
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,847
 this steam locomotive is ready 
   for the chimney and boiler.  

158
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,584
         the steam dome         
 and a safety valve go on next, 

159
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,587
  followed by the cab and roof. 

160
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,126
and this garden steam locomotive
        is now complete.        

161
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:00,064
   a worker now shines a light  
    through the boiler tubes    

162
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,068
         to examine them        
      for any obstructions.     

163
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,805
  he pokes a brush through them 
          to be certain         

164
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,274
       and then gives them      
         the all-clear.         

165
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,748
 it's time to fire up the boiler
        using real coal.        

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,954
hot gases flow through the tubes
to heat the water in the boiler.

167
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:25,490
       like a big kettle,       
this locomotive builds up steam.

168
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,429
     the pressure increases     
    until it's ready to roll.   

169
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,034
       aboard one of these      
   garden locomotive replicas,  

170
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:40,105
  one can relive the heady days 
        of steam engines.       

171
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,724
  narrator: a hovercraft rides  
       on a cushion of air      

172
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,393
    created by powerful fans.   

173
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:05,464
this enables the craft to travel
     over both land and sea.    

174
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,533
           the concept          
  actually dates back to 1870,  

175
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,536
       but it wasn't until      
 the middle of the 20th century 

176
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,805
     that a british inventor    
          perfected it          

177
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,141
and the idea got off the ground.

178
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,347
    this model of hovercraft    
 is equipped with a single fan. 

179
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,882
   it both inflates the skirt,  

180
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,218
       lifting the vessel       
        about 10 inches,        

181
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,220
       and creates thrust       
    to propel the hovercraft    

182
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,523
   over virtually any surface.  

183
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,431
  production begins with a hull 

184
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,968
       made of lightweight      
          polyethylene.         

185
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,504
the fabricator installs aluminum
       skids on the bottom      

186
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,508
   to protect the hull during   
   landings on rough surfaces.  

187
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:58,049
  he screws plastic attachments 
    for the hovercraft skirt    

188
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,619
    into pre-marked positions   
          on the hull.          

189
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,258
      the technician drills     
    65 holes around the hull.   

190
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,927
          the fan's air         
  will pass through these holes 

191
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,664
  to fill the hovercraft skirt. 

192
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,067
  the hull consists of a thick, 
        hard outer layer        

193
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,405
  and a low-density inner layer 
that makes the material buoyant.

194
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,343
 it's what keeps the hovercraft 
 afloat during stops on water.  

195
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,416
      the crew now fastens      
    the seat base and console   

196
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,452
    in the front of the hull.   

197
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,092
   once it's secure, they fit   
  the gauge panel in its slot.  

198
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,165
       the team then moves      
     to the back of the hull    

199
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,300
   to install the drive belt,   
             pulley,            

200
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,302
    and the main drive frame.   

201
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,507
 this pulley will transfer power
   from the engine to the fan.  

202
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,311
        once they confirm       
    everything moves freely,    

203
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,913
      they assemble the fan     
     to the main drive frame    

204
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,883
    with high-tension bolts.    

205
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,859
 this duct will divide the fan's
      air into two streams.     

206
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:17,529
   one stream will be directed  
under the craft to provide lift.

207
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:22,734
    the other will be routed    
out the back to generate thrust.

208
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,936
 they now return to the cockpit 

209
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,407
      to attach handlebars      
    to a steering mechanism.    

210
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,615
    the engine can be either    
  a two-stroke or four-stroke,  

211
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:40,018
          depending on          
  the amount of power desired.  

212
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,420
         they connect it        
      to the drive assembly     

213
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,757
   and protect that connection  
       with metal casing.       

214
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,361
         once the engine        
   has been bolted into place,  

215
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,296
they equip it with a radiator...

216
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,900
        an air filter...        

217
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,168
      an exhaust system...      

218
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,772
 and a waterproof box containing
   the electrical components.   

219
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,974
 then they connect the fuel tank
          to the engine         

220
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,510
      and cover the engine      
    with a polyethylene hood    

221
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,779
         to keep it dry.        

222
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,382
      they install seating,     
     including a rear bench,    

223
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,519
    that accommodates three.    

224
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,623
  then the installer attaches   
  two rudders to the fan duct.  

225
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,931
    he links them with a bar    
   so they'll move in tandem.   

226
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,203
      these steering parts      
 are made of marine-grade steel 

227
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,205
       to prevent rusting.      

228
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,275
     a quick check confirms     
  the rudders are operational.  

229
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,016
     the hovercraft's skirt     
  is made of the same material  

230
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:49,354
      used on shoe soles --     
   sturdy polyurethane nylon.   

231
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:54,559
   they assemble the skirt to   
the hull in 65 different pieces.

232
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,761
  the worker loops each segment 
       over a side bumper       

233
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,431
         and secures it         
       with a steel clip.       

234
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,434
        he then attaches        
 the bottom of each skirt piece 

235
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:05,503
to the little hooks on the hull.

236
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,106
   he uses plastic cable ties   
          for this job,         

237
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,707
   and there's a good reason.   

238
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,244
          if the skirt          
  becomes snagged on something, 

239
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,113
     these ties will break      
     and free that section.     

240
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,582
  then other parts of the skirt 
        will balloon out        

241
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,285
       to fill the breach       
  and maintain the air cushion. 

242
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,657
   and they also won't have to  
    replace the whole skirt,    

243
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,461
        just the section        
      that's been damaged.      

244
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,665
    after a final inspection,   

245
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,868
    they take this hovercraft   
        for a test spin.        

246
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,671
     they check the steering    
     and overall performance    

247
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,741
    and enjoy gliding on air.   

248
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:02,360
   narrator: a folding bicycle  
   is a compact set of wheels.  

249
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,563
     in seconds, it folds up    
   into a neat little bundle,   

250
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,966
        less than a third       
        of its full size.       

251
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,635
   the concept has been around  
    for well over a century,    

252
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,104
      and in recent years,      
   it's on the comeback trail   

253
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,306
       as urban commuters       
     discover the advantages    

254
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,343
          of downsizing         
  this mode of transportation.  

255
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,316
 a few quick folds and this bike
  no longer carries the rider.  

256
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,651
         he carries it.         

257
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,321
   the bike can then be carted  
       onto public transit      

258
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,589
       or into the office,      

259
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,959
  and that makes it a handy way 
       to get around town.      

260
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,398
         they lubricate         
       the rim of tubing,       

261
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,135
      which makes it easier     
for machinery to pinch that end.

262
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:48,073
        the next machine        
       uses several blades      

263
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,276
     to trim the pinched end    
     and cut a small groove.    

264
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,945
        these exact cuts        
      will enable the team      

265
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,781
      to precisely install      
      a hinge to the tube.      

266
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,551
     hinges are now gripped     
        by a moving clamp       

267
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,486
 that angles them for contouring

268
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,955
    and the drilling of holes   
           for bolts.           

269
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,090
   it's computer choreographed  

270
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:11,696
  to produce a hinge that will  
 attach snugly to the main tube.

271
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,432
 once the hinge has been bonded 
        to the main tube,       

272
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,900
   a technician checks the job  

273
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,303
         by exposing it         
      to a magnetic field.      

274
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,506
     variations in the field    
     would indicate a flaw,     

275
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,508
       but he finds none.       

276
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,644
  so next, he secures the tube  
         on a work table        

277
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,314
    so a tool can make scoops   
        in the other end.       

278
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,650
scooping this end will enable it

279
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,387
  to interconnect with another  
     part of the bike frame.    

280
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,389
        a hydraulic tool        
    then bends the main tube    

281
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,191
    to give it a slight curve   

282
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:43,194
         so it will arch        
     around a bicycle wheel.    

283
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,935
   you can see the difference   
 in this before-and-after shot. 

284
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,804
 the main tube of the bike frame

285
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,807
     now undergoes a process    
      called shot blasting.     

286
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,475
    an operator turns a crank   

287
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,678
    to make the tube revolve    
     in an enclosed chamber     

288
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,982
    as nozzles blow fine grit   
       at the hinge point.      

289
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:10,154
         this cleans up         
   some of the rough patches.   

290
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:14,359
 a little manual filing smoothes
   the area around the hinge.   

291
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,761
          smaller parts         
      of the bicycle frame      

292
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,429
take a tumble with ceramic bits,

293
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,031
    and this agitation action   

294
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,934
       improves the finish      
         on these parts.        

295
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,841
          further down          
      the production line,      

296
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,110
  a worker locks the main tube  
            in a jig.           

297
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:37,248
  he butts a bracing tube to it 
   at just the right angle...   

298
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,217
      and then melts metal      
         into the joint         

299
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,718
  in a process called brazing.  

300
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,055
       as the metal cools       
         and solidifies,        

301
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,590
     it seals the two parts.    

302
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,525
 he now fits the bottom bracket 

303
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,928
      onto the scooped end      
        of the main tube        

304
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,596
    and brazes them together.   

305
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,933
 the frame of a folding bicycle 
      is much more complex      

306
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,136
   than that of a conventional  
     one-piece a-frame bike.    

307
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,207
 there are six parts to assemble
       in tight alignment,      

308
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:06,610
     and that means there's     
  absolutely no room for error. 

309
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,481
  once the main frame assembly  
        has been painted,       

310
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:13,284
     it's ready to be joined    
       to the rear frame.       

311
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,820
         he attaches it         
      by bolting the hinge.     

312
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,956
       he twists the bolts      
    to just the right torque.   

313
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,826
      he tests the folding      
      and unfolding action      

314
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,361
      of the rear assembly      

315
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,962
    and then checks the lock    

316
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,865
           to confirm           
   that it functions properly.  

317
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,170
           he installs          
     the steering mechanism     

318
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,573
         and wheel fork         
  in the front of the frame...  

319
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,576
    and bolts the front wheel   
          to the fork.          

320
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,848
        he verifies that        
  the assembled steering column 

321
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,251
         and handlebars         
     are in working order...    

322
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:50,988
 and then slides them into place
  at the front of the bicycle.  

323
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,324
     he adjusts the position    
          of the column         

324
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:56,027
           so it folds          
    at just the right angle.    

325
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,001
he then attaches the rear wheel,

326
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,371
    along with the gear hub,    
          to the frame.         

327
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,543
   he secures the chain wheel   
   and pedals to the bicycle    

328
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,280
       and fits the chain       
       into the sprockets,      

329
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,680
      joining the two ends      

330
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,818
    so the chain will travel    
      in a perpetual loop.      

331
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,020
   he flips the bicycle around  
      to install the seat,      

332
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,489
     and it's time to fold.     

333
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,959
   the rear frame flips neatly  
  under the main tube assembly. 

334
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,562
    the front wheel locks on    
       to the rear frame.       

335
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,498
  sliding the seat pillar down  
         locks the fold,        

336
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,867
          and he lowers         
      the steering column.      

337
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,771
    after a final inspection,   

338
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:43,307
      this folding bicycle      
   is ready for the big city.   

339
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,710
    and when dodging traffic    
  becomes too much of a hassle, 

340
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,782
  its owner can always fold it  
    and take public transit.
