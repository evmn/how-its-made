00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,560
   arrive at a camera station.  

130
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,597
     the camera clicks away     
and sends pictures of the boards

131
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,699
         to a computer.         

132

      the computer analyzes     
the placement of each component.

       the probes energize      
  the components on the boards

252
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,877

 the cordial's deepening flavor.

253
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,417
    when the taste and color    
        seem just right,        

254
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,753
 he removes the spices and pumps

     into 25-ounce bottles.     

256
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,859
      this bottling system      
    is equipped with a filter   

257
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,330
    to remove any impurities.   

258
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,833
 once full, he corks the bottle.

259
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,039
    using a special labeling    
 machine, he rolls on the label 

260
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,476
         that identifies        
   the product for marketing.   

261
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,650
 he then heat-shrinks a plastic 
      seal around the cork.     

262
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,491
   he puts a signature on it,   
    and this cinnamon cordial

267
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,986
     and you're sure to come    
  across a collection of rasps. 

268
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,422
a rasp is a hand tool with teeth
      that you push forward     

269
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,058
          with pressure         
     over wood to shape it.     

270
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,228
 rasps come in various textures,
         called grains,         

271
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,364
  ranging from coarse to fine.  

272
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,903
       machine-made rasps       
   may suffice for hobbyists,   

273
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:48,606
  but fine woodworking requires 
    premium rasps like these,   

274
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,742
which are made entirely by hand.

275
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,916
  a rasp starts out as a steel  
      bar, called a blank.      

276
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:01,219
  first, a worker heats one end 
     of the blank in an oven    

277
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,854
        at a temperature        
        of approximately        

278
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,490
    1,500 degrees fahrenheit.   

279
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:09,093
 when the steel glows somewhere 
     between orange and red,    

280
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:14,298
   he immediately cuts the end  
 to a crude point with a press. 

281
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,168
     then he places the end     
      under a spring hammer     

282
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,404
        which strikes it        
    repeatedly against a die,   

283
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,274
     forging the crude point    
        to a refined one.

286
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,322
      he inserts the blank      
    into a shearing machine.    

287
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,057
  this cuts across the middle,  

288
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,793
       dividing the blank       
      into two flat rasps,      

289
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,430
     each with a pointed end    
         and a flat end.        

290
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,470
    the worker puts the flat    
       end into the oven.       

291

      working temperature,      

292
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,775
    he places it in a press.    

293
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,478
the first strike tapers the end.

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,548
    the second cuts off steel   
   to form the tool's handle,   

295
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,784
        called the tang.        

296
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,854
 the rasp shape is fully forged.

297
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:14,325
    an experienced craftsman    
     now begins refining it.    

298
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,661
    first, he runs it against   
        a grinding wheel        

299
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:20,565
     to remove excess steel.    

300
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,868
       because steel warps      
     in the forging process,    

301
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,470
   he hammers along the tang,   

302
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:28,973
        point, and length       
     to straighten the rasp.    

303
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,543
      this step is critical     
     for structural strength    

304
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,846
   because if the grain of the  
 steel isn't perfectly straight,

305
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,883
     the rasp will warp when    
   the craftsman later hardens  

306
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,151
     the steel by tempering.    

307
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,521
   once the rasp is straight,   

308
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,591
   he grinds the flat surfaces  
       on a grinding belt.      

309
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,328
       then he returns to       
       the grinding wheel       

310
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,065
     to remove excess steel     
        around the point.       

311
00:18:58,671 --> 00:21:17,808
