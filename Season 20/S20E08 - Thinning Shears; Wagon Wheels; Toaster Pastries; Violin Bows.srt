    discovery communications

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,988
     narrator: when it comes    
   to choosing baby's vehicle,  

4
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,525
   as with any set of wheels,   
 there's no shortage of choices.

5
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,860
       some parents prefer      
         sporty models,         

6
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,464
    while others opt for the    
 elegance of a classic carriage.

7
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,800
           either way,          
    it's a stylish experience   

8
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,503
 baby will likely sleep through.

9
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,879
    the classic perambulator,   
      or "pram" for short.      

10
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,348
        while this style        
        of baby carriage        

11
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,083
    is unmistakably british,    

12
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:27,286
      this particular brand     
        is italian-made.        

13
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,690
       production begins        
       with this machine,       

14
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,727
    which bends steel tubing    
   to form the pram's handle.   

15
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:41,033
    the machine's every move    
       is computer-guided       

16
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,637
  for accuracy and consistency  
       from pram to pram.       

17
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,274
          once formed,          
  the handle is chrome-plated.  

18
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,985
         they construct         
  the base of the pram's frame  

19
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,854
       out of steel blade.      

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,990
       an automatic feeder      
         pulls the blade        

21
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,126
          off the roll          
    into a stamping machine.    

22
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,462
     the machine's die cuts     
         21"-long pieces        

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,531
       with rounded ends.       

24
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,871
          a press then          
     bends each piece twice,    

25
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,341
 forming it to the final shape. 

26
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,077
      to assemble the base,     
    workers align the pieces    

27
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,280
  in the correct configuration  
  with the help of a template.  

28
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,885
     they add two steel rods    
  for the front and rear axles, 

29
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,955
 then weld everything together. 

30
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,430
     the base then goes off     
    to be plated with chrome.   

31
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:48,434
   when it returns, following   
   some minor assembly steps,   

32
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,769
 the full frame assembly begins.

33
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,173
     workers mount two large    
oval, steel springs on the base,

34
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,576
          securing them         
      with pivoting hinges.     

35
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,279
  fold flat for easy transport. 

36
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,616
       they hammer a rivet      
       into each hinge...       

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,522
     ...then, using clamps,     
           lock it in.          

38
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,390
   the pram has a cargo basket  

39
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,326
     made of chrome-plated,     
       welded, steel mesh.      

40
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,395
  it hooks onto the frame base. 

41
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:19,598
  the pram's handle, meanwhile, 
       has acquired a grip      

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,801
   made of chrome-plated steel  
      and genuine leather.      

43
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,004
     they attach the handle     
          to the frame          

44
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,005
 with a plastic, pivoting hinge 

45
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,609
    which enables the handle    
to fold down flat for transport.

46
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,078
     a spring locking device    

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,214
secures the chrome-plated wheels
          to the axles.         

48
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,017
          a foot lever          
    at the rear of the frame    

49
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,920
      activates the brake       
      on both rear wheels.      

50
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,625
        the pram body has       
    an upholstered covering.    

51
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,160
    they make it by layering    

52
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,430
    a rugged polyester fabric   
  over soft polyester batting,  

53
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,768
  then fusing the two materials 
       along the perimeter      

54
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,573
    with heat generated by a    
 high-frequency welding machine.

55
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,110
  this upholstered covering is  
   made up of three sections.   

56
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,855
       after trimming off       
       the excess fabric,       

57
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,392
      a seamstress stitches     
  the three sections together,  

58
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,328
   then she lines the interior  
          with cotton,          

59
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,766
       a breathable fabric      
 that's soft against baby skin. 

60
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,271
   the body structure is made   
        of plywood sides,       

61
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:36,408
     poplar bottom supports,    
   and sturdy fiberboard ends.  

62
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,877
        after cushioning        
       the sides and edges      

63
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,346
     with polyester batting,    

64
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,282
       they dress the body      
  with the upholstered covering 

65
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,751
  and lay in a cotton mattress. 

66
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,893
        after installing        
      metal carry handles,      

67
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:55,828
  they affix the pram's canopy, 

68
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,430
       driving the screws       
     through the upholstery     

69
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,633
     into pre-drilled holes     
   in the plywood's structure.  

70
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,834
       the canopy is made       

71
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,304
       of water-resistant       
       laminated polyester      

72
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,573
sewn over a frame of steel ribs.

73
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,509
      the ribs are hinged,      

74
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:14,379
enabling the canopy to be opened
    and locked or collapsed.    

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,116
          the snap-on,          
    upholstered front cover,    

76
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:20,585
    like the canopy, is made    
     of laminated polyester     

77
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,188
         to protect baby        
       from rain and cold.      

78
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,326
 metal pins underneath the body 
  fit into slots on the frame,  

79
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:31,530
       locking it securely      
          with a lever.         

80
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,065
      for quality control,      

81
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,202
   the factory regularly tests  
         random samples,        

82
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:40,005
 putting them through 100 hours 
     of simulated bumpy road    

83
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,675
           at a speed           
     of three miles an hour.    

84
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:46,945
   the pram must survive this   
 not very baby-friendly journey 

85
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,216
       with nothing beyond      
      normal wear and tear.     

86
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:08,166
            narrator:           
   documents say a two-story,   
    panelized-frame dwelling    

87
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,570
    was shipped from england    
      to the u.s. in 1764,      

88
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,507
   but perhaps the first real   
  predecessors of modular homes 

89
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,711
    were sold from catalogues   
       in the early 1900s.      

90
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,846
 these kit homes eventually led 

91
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,515
         to houses built        
      in a factory setting.     

92
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,652
 not only do factory-built homes
           cost less,           

93
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:30,789
    they tend to be much more   
 energy-efficient and versatile.

94
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,257
     they are quick to build    

95
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,526
       and offer a variety      
        of space options        

96
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,995
      with all the comforts     
        and conveniences        

97
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,397
     of conventional houses.    

98
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,532
   they provide ease of living  

99
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,468
    and ease of construction,   
            as well.            

100
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,204
         in the factory,        
 a worker welds the steel pieces

101
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,607
          that make up          
   the undercarriage chassis.   

102
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,878
      its length depends on     
  the demands of the customer.  

103
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,347
          workers move          
      the completed chassis     

104
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,549
to the next part of the factory.

105
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,685
        they pull a layer       
         of polyethylene        

106
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,420
 over the length of the chassis 

107
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:06,025
       and roll a blanket       
of fiberglass insulation on top.

108
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,228
 framing for the home's subfloor
          is in place,          

109
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,165
      along with waterlines     
       and heating ducts.       

110
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,567
          an assembler          
     nails the framing joist    

111
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,670
      to a perimeter rail.      

112
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,641
         they apply glue        
       to the floor joists      

113
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:26,278
and cover the floor framing with
  composite wood floor decking. 

114
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,984
         the assemblers         
  nail the decking into place.  

115
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,854
   a worker glues vinyl tiles   
        onto the decking.       

116
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,856
        flooring comes in       
     a variety of materials,    

117
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:43,462
 including marble, ceramic tile,
   carpet, laminate, and wood.  

118
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,464
 in another part of the factory,

119
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,667
     framers are working on     
   the home's interior walls.   

120
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,068
     building them on tables    

121
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,471
       tends to make them       
     straighter and stronger    

122
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,007
    than walls that are built   
        standing upright.       

123
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,878
       workers fill these       
 exterior walls with insulation.

124
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,014
the efficiency of the insulation

125
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:06,018
 depends on the climate in which
   the home will be installed.  

126
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,387
     workers apply adhesive     
          to the studs.         

127
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,693
 they position interior paneling
    and staple it into place.   

128
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,766
             this is            
   the factory's cabinet shop.  

129
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,767
these specialized cabinet makers

130
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,370
       use a wide variety       
     of materials and styles    

131
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,907
       to create bathroom       
      and kitchen cabinets,     

132
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,778
    such as this double-sink    
         galley cabinet.        

133
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,984
 workers begin putting cabinets 
    on the floor of the home.   

134
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,787
     in factory-built homes,    
     cabinets are installed     

135
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,324
  before exterior and partition 
  walls have been put in place, 

136
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,894
   making the job a lot easier  
        and more precise.       

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,002
        once the cabinets       
  and interior walls are done,  

138
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,404
 workers install exterior walls.

139
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,274
       they add this wall       
    with the help of a crane.   

140
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,414
          the wall fits         
      precisely into place.     

141
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,285
both the wall and interior frame
        are pre-caulked,        

142
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,955
       and when they meet,      
   they form an airtight seal.  

143
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:20,359
  workers move this section to  
the next station in the factory.

144
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:27,699
    using a crane, they lower   
 the ceiling system into place. 

145
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,702
      the ceiling system is     
         all one piece.         

146
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,172
   workers lower it carefully,  

147
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:37,576
making sure the ceiling lines up
precisely with the walls below. 

148
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,845
 all the walls are pre-caulked, 

149
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:43,515
  and once they set the ceiling 
  down, it's completely sealed, 

150
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,118
      adding to the home's      
       energy efficiency.       

151
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,386
          workers blow          
      cellulose insulation      

152
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,523
      into the attic cavity     
   to form a thermal barrier.   

153
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,193
          before adding         
   the exterior roof covering,  

154
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,263
     specialized roofers put    
  wood decking over the trusses 

155
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,199
    and staple it into place.   

156
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:02,534
   pvc piping is used to drain  

157
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:06,138
     the home's waste water     
        and sewer lines.        

158
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,409
   assemblers now install lap   
 siding over a moisture barrier.

159
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:14,413
    sidings can be composite,   
     vinyl, cement, or wood     

160
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,281
    with different finishes.    

161
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,252
 this cement board is impervious
     to bugs and won't rot.     

162
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,690
  a drywall finisher is inside, 

163
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,759
      taping and texturing      
      the gypsum wallboard      

164
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,963
      and applying plaster      
     to walls and ceilings.     

165
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,636
     this particular home is    
     ready for off-grid use.    

166
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,974
    solar panels on the roof    
    charge batteries by day.    

167
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,043
    the batteries store power   
        for use at night.       

168
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,981
   this single-module cottage,  
 like most factory-built homes, 

169
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,718
can be transported and delivered
     anywhere in the world.     

170
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,255
    comfortable, affordable,    
      and energy-efficient,     

171
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:01,326
      factory-built houses      
 have redefined the dream home. 

172
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:18,810
            narrator:           
    the wood flute is one of    
 the oldest musical instruments.

173
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:22,881
  every culture had a version,  
 but the native american one has

174
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,552
  a particularly soulful sound  
    and a very romantic past.   

175
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:27,886
         for centuries,         

176
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,290
   native men played the flute  
     to court their beloved,    

177
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:34,226
       and it became known      
     as the courting flute.     

178
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,695
        [ flute playing ]       

179
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,567
    today, the courting flute   
    courts a wider following.   

180
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,571
       its appeal reaches       
  beyond the native community.  

181
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:51,109
with two chambers instead of one
 and a block-whistle mechanism, 

182
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,879
    the native american flute   
           is unique.           

183
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,716
 it takes less skill and effort 
           to play it,          

184
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,052
     and the tranquil tones     
          offer relief          

185
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,288
          from the din          
      of the modern world.      

186
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,259
 to make one, a native craftsman

187
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,662
 cleanly splits a piece of cedar
        with a table saw.       

188
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,131
       no need to craft it      
        entirely by hand        

189
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,401
       when there are now       
  mechanized woodworking tools. 

190
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,471
         with a router,         
 he carves a hollow in one end. 

191
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,540
         it will be half        
of the flute's slow air chamber,

192
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,510
   which is the first chamber   
       to receive breath.       

193
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,148
          he now shapes         
 the much longer sound chamber. 

194
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,951
        it's the one that       
  sets the pitch of the notes.  

195
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,891
  after routering corresponding 
hollows in the other cedar half,

196
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,760
         he applies glue        
     and spreads it evenly.     

197
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,563
    a consistent application    
           is crucial.          

198
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,634
            any gaps            
    and the flute won't work.   

199
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:50,234
    me matches up the pieces    

200
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,404
         and clamps them        
        for a solid seal.       

201
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,708
           the clamps           
     squeeze out some glue,     

202
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,544
   so he wipes it away quickly  
        before it dries.        

203
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,049
     he cleans up the inside    

204
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:08,119
  with sandpaper wrapped around 
the end of a spinning metal rod.

205
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:12,190
    once the assembly dries,    
    he builds the mouthpiece,   

206
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,660
      using a brand of dark     
    african wood for contrast   

207
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,463
     and then a thick chunk     
         of myrtlewood.         

208
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,932
          myrtlewood is         
    finely-grained and hard,    

209
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,001
so it will hold up to heavy use.

210
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,406
     he drills into the wood    
   to carve out the mouthpiece  

211
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:30,475
       and breaks through       
    to the slow air chamber.    

212
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,345
      it's time for a spin      
          in the lathe.         

213
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,346
   the craftsman turns a wheel  

214
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,217
  to move a chain-driven router 
    along the spinning wood.    

215
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,287
   it shaves the wood a little  
         with each pass         

216
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,556
to take it from square to round.

217
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,559
       he mills the flute       
    between the two chambers    

218
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,094
       to create the nest,      

219
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:53,365
     a flat area with holes     
 upon which the block will rest.

220
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,899
     it's through this area     

221
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,035
         that air passes        
 from one chamber to the other. 

222
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,107
he cuts off splinters that could
  ruin the sound of the flute.  

223
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,909
   he builds up the nest area   

224
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,911
     with a precisely-shaped    
       flat piece of wood.      

225
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,514
       he bores through it      
       into the nest hole       

226
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,384
          to reopen it          
  and give it its final shape.  

227
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,520
        he carves a ramp        
  to compress and speed up air  

228
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,857
        as it passes from       
the first chamber to the second.

229
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,959
            he drills           
     the smaller sound hole.    

230
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:27,265
  after he files the sound hole 
     to a rectangular shape,    

231
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,868
     he positions the block     
         over the nest.         

232
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,137
      it's this wood block      
          that creates          

233
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,473
     the clear whistle tone     
          of the flute.         

234
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,275
     the length of the tube     

235
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,544
      determines the pitch      
       of the instrument.       

236
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,145
     he blows into the flute    

237
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,015
       and checks the dial      
      of the digital tuner.     

238
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,018
    the key is a bit too low,   
       so he cuts the end       

239
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,421
      to take it up to "g"      
          on the scale.         

240
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:55,226
    satisfied with the pitch,   
   he drills six finger holes.  

241
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,696
         he spaces them         
   in a precise configuration.  

242
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,299
      the size of the holes     
          vary slightly         

243
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,835
         to help create         
       the desired notes.       

244
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,511
       he files the edges       
 of the finger holes on an angle

245
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,713
  to bring the notes into tune. 

246
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,584
    he tests the flute again.   

247
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,922
  it's in the correct range --  
       no tweaking needed.      

248
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:29,194
  he now tapers the mouthpiece  
      using a belt sander.      

249
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,262
   he uses a fairly rough grit  

250
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,332
          to transform          
   the cylindrical mouthpiece   

251
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,602
        into a cone shape       
   that's easier on the lips.   

252
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,341
         he scrutinizes         
  the newly-sculpted mouthpiece 

253
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,077
          and confirms          
    that the shape is right.    

254
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,381
     he signs and numbers it    
    with a wood-burning tool.   

255
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,152
        finally, he coats       
   this native american flute   

256
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,087
    with protective acrylic.    

257
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,826
          using modern          
     woodworking techniques,    

258
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,896
     a centuries-old musical    
   instrument has been updated  

259
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:08,200
and it's now ready to entertain.

260
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,460
   narrator: in the first half  
      of the 18th century,      

261
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,396
  bike tires were made of wood, 
           then metal,          

262
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,331
  and after that, solid rubber. 

263
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,601
        finally, in 1888,       

264
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,203
     a scottish veterinarian    
        named john dunlop       

265
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,472
            developed           
    an air-filled rubber tire   

266
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,642
   to give his son's tricycle   
        a smoother ride.        

267
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,815
   the air-filled bicycle tire  

268
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:00,084
         continues to be        
the hottest thing on two wheels,

269
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:04,289
but a modern spin on the concept
takes it into the 21st century. 

270
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,024
        computer designed       

271
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,826
   for minimal road resistance  
        and aerodynamics,       

272
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,163
the inflatable bike tire has had
         a major update.        

273
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:18,036
 additives such as mineral oil, 
    sulfur, and carbon black    

274
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,239
          make the tire         
    more elastic and durable,   

275
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,443
   and they use a combination   

276
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,446
     of natural, synthetic,     
      and recycled rubber.      

277
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,181
      they weigh and bag it     

278
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,251
        and send it into        
     an enormous hot mixer.     

279
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,154
        the white blocks        
    are the synthetic stuff.    

280
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,026
    other ingredients include   
       anti-aging agents.       

281
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,663
       during the mixing,       
       a chemical reaction      

282
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,465
     causes the plastic bags    
        to disintegrate,        

283
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,001
          leaving only          
      the desired elements.     

284
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,337
       the components melt      
      into a rubbery dough,     

285
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,674
     and rollers squeeze it     
       into thick sheets.       

286
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,211
   this rubber sheet will now   
   be used to make the tire,    

287
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,680
    beginning with the tread.   

288
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,083
         narrower strips        
       enter an extruder.       

289
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,552
       it heats the rubber      
          to soften it          

290
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,220
   and takes it through a die   

291
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,757
   to form a strategic profile  
    for the bike-tire tread,    

292
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,761
leaving it thicker in the center
  and thinner along the edges.  

293
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,300
      the tire-tread rubber     

294
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,836
    now takes a long cool dip   
       in a tub of water.       

295
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,908
       this solidifies it,      
   setting the profile shape.   

296
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,711
 an automated spool winds it up 

297
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,914
     with a fabric separator    
    between the rubber layers   

298
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,450
          to keep them          
     from sticking together.    

299
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,121
        in the meantime,        
 rubber for the bike-tire casing

300
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,057
       has been reinforced      
        with nylon mesh.        

301
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,694
       this casing rubber       
  now enters a cutting station. 

302
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,666
 blades slice the casing rubber 
           into strips          

303
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:58,403
   that are the correct width   
   for building bicycle tires.  

304
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:01,072
      it will take several      
       to build one tire.       

305
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,146
   an employee pieces all the   
 strips together for production.

306
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,685
  he winds the assembled strips 
        of casing rubber        

307
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,754
      onto fabric backing.      

308
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,288
   neatly rolled onto spools,   

309
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,325
    the rubber can be stored    
    until the tire assembly.    

310
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,096
   and they're ready to roll.   

311
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,966
        an employee winds       
   the nylon-reinforced rubber  

312
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,634
      around a metal drum.      

313
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,837
        she then applies        
   two strong, kevlar threads   

314
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,305
       for the tire beads.      

315
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,775
  the beads will hold the tire  
        to the wheel rim.       

316
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,110
         once in place,         

317
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,514
     devices fold the rubber    
  at the sides over the beads.  

318
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,251
  she then wraps a kevlar strip 
     around the tire casing.    

319
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,287
this is for puncture protection.

320
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:56,227
  a machine now rolls the tread 
  rubber onto the kevlar strip. 

321
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,668
       with all the layers      
   of the bike tire in place,   

322
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,003
  she removes it from the drum. 

323
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,140
         then it's over         
    to the branding station.    

324
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,744
   this worker arranges labels  
       on the tire rubber       

325
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,580
      and bonds them to it      
     with hot metal plates.     

326
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,684
        the next employee       
     places the tire rubber     

327
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,419
    in a clamshell-like mold.   

328
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,623
       this mold contains       
  a large balloon, or bladder.  

329
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,025
         they pump steam        
        into the balloon,       

330
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:32,764
 causing it to press the rubber 
 against the sides of the mold. 

331
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,500
      this shapes the tire,     
      including the tread,      

332
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,837
            and fuses           
    all the layers together.    

333
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,373
   it also transforms the tire  
       from limp to rigid       

334
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,310
       in a process known       
       as vulcanization,        

335
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:48,680
and it's quite a transformation.

336
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,651
        this is the tire        
      before vulcanization,     

337
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:57,322
   and this is the tire after.  

338
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,724
     one tire from the batch    
   undergoes a gamut of tests.  

339
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,127
  this one simulates road wear. 

340
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:07,665
 the tire spins against a metal 
    wheel until it goes bald,   

341
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,869
      usually after several     
   thousand miles of spinning.  

342
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:14,339
  this confirms that the tires  
    from this production run    

343
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:17,808
        are long-wearing        
    and can go the distance.    

344
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,210
         they also test         

345
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,013
     for puncture resistance    
       and pressurization.      

346
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:25,283
       if the bicycle tire      
      passes all the tests,     

347
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,887
       this batch is ready      
    to test human endurance.    

348
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,631
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,
