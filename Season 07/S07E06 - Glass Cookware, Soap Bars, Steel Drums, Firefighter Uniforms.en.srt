00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,291
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,527
      ...glass cookware...      

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,466
         ...soap bars...        

6
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,805
        ...steel drums...       

7
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,677
  ...and firefighter uniforms.  

8
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,785
        pyrex is an idea        

9
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,522
      cooked up by the wife     
  of a glass-industry scientist 

10
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,123
            in 1913.            

11
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:01,059
  she believed the tough glass  
     used in lantern globes     

12
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,195
         would be great         
      for baking cakes in,      

13
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,197
 so she baked one in some glass 
    her husband brought home.   

14
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,732
       the cake was a hit,      

15
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:11,770
 changing the notion that glass 
  was too fragile for the oven. 

16
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,144
      today, in most homes,     

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,146
           you'll find          
  different types of cookware,  

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,883
          many of which         
      are made from pyrex.      

19
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,952
     to produce some dishes,    

20
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,821
      a batch feeder pushes     
 ingredients into a big furnace 

21
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,926
          as they spill         
     out of a bin overhead.     

22
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,498
           silica sand          
 is the biggest part of the mix.

23
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:44,970
  it's a crystalline substance, 
 and it makes glass transparent.

24
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:50,442
     the batch also includes    
  soda ash and recycled glass.  

25
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,779
  some of the other ingredients 
       are a trade secret.      

26
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,591
    the furnace heats the mix   
      to the melting point,     

27
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,794
 over 2,700 degrees fahrenheit. 

28
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:13,398
   it turns into molten glass   
      that looks like lava.     

29
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,667
           the glass,           
     in this lava-like form,    

30
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,471
    will spend up to 24 hours   
         in the furnace.        

31
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,842
   on its way out, mechanical   
    shears cut it into gobs.    

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,818
       the gobs slide down      
      a water-cooled chute      

33
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,555
            and drop            
 into a baking-dish-shaped mold.

34
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,231
       there are 16 molds       
      on a rotating table.      

35
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,498
          as it turns,          

36
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:51,103
     the table delivers the     
 gob-filled molds to a plunger, 

37
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,639
       which presses them       
   into the baking-dish shape.  

38
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,241
      continuing to rotate,     

39
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,910
  the table positions the molds 
         under blowers.         

40
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:04,182
  they cool the freshly-molded  
  glass so it holds its shape.  

41
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:07,319
        a mechanical arm        
   suctions up the glass dish   

42
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,522
        and sets it down        
   on another revolving table.  

43
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:15,727
    flames lick the glassware   
  from burners above and below. 

44
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,995
       the dish is exposed      

45
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,498
    to a temperature of over    
    1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

46
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,569
  this softens its sharp edges  
   so that the rim is smooth.   

47
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,942
              next,             
 hoses blast high-pressure air, 

48
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,078
       cooling the dishes       
        to solidify them,       

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,347
    so that a mechanical arm    
        can pick them up        

50
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,748
      without ruining them.     

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,222
 it transports the glass dishes 
       to a conveyor belt.      

52
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,425
    further down, another arm   
   feeds the dishes to a kiln,  

53
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,295
where heating and cooling cycles
        temper the glass.       

54
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:54,632
    this is what gives pyrex    
          its strength.         

55
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,636
 now it's time to make the lid. 

56
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,907
   a different plunger presses  
  glass gobs into a lid shape.  

57
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,176
     every lid needs a knob,    

58
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,780
so a valve inside the mold forms
 it, and then thrusts the lid up

59
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,984
         to be picked up        
      by a mechanical arm.      

60
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:17,122
    the arm flips its lid and   
sets it down on a conveyor belt.

61
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,595
    the lids are on the move,   

62
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,632
        traveling through       
        a tempering kiln.       

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,871
        on their way out,       
      a fan cools them off      

64
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,741
   so that they can be handled  
    by human hands this time.   

65
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,313
 workers inspect each glass lid 
      before packing them.      

66
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,820
        on another line,        
  measuring cups are produced.  

67
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,489
        little platforms        
     lift the measuring cups    

68
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,891
       to suctioning arms       

69
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,561
       that protrude from       
a revolving silk-screen machine.

70
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:00,598
        a little squeegee       
 forces enamel through a screen,

71
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,136
      printing measurements     
          onto the cup.         

72
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,511
    over in the lab, a worker   
    roughs up a sample dish.    

73
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:17,849
by rubbing it with sandpaper, he
 mimics years of wear and tear. 

74
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,253
 but it's about to be subjected 
       to even more abuse.      

75
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,925
     he places a sharp tool     
    in the center of the dish   

76
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,861
  and takes aim with a hammer.  

77
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,032
will it break without shattering
  into numerous little shards?  

78
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,868
       it's a clean break,      

79
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:40,739
      which means this dish     
 has met the quality standards. 

80
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,291
            narrator:           
   the widespread use of soap   

81
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,961
   has elevated our standards   
         of cleanliness.        

82
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,763
         the ingredients        
      that are used in soap     

83
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,432
           remove dirt          
    and dangerous pathogens.    

84
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,167
  regularly washing your hands  

85
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,503
     can reduce the chances     
       of you getting sick      

86
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,906
    and will make your world    
     a more hygienic place.     

87
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,716
     soap comes in a variety    
of shapes, colors, and textures,

88
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,520
     even different scents.     

89
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,323
        but it all starts       
      in a bubbling kettle,     

90
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,993
  where animal or vegetable fat 
  reacts with sodium hydroxide, 

91
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:39,464
      a caustic substance,      
         to create soap.        

92
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,934
they add water to keep it fluid,

93
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,937
   as steam bubbles up through  
   the center to mix it all up  

94
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,007
          and encourage         
     the chemical reaction.     

95
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,948
this may look like an arctic ice
 floe, but it's the leftovers --

96
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,818
        soap that settled       
  at the bottom of the kettle.  

97
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:03,955
 they pour it all into this tank
 and reuse it in the next batch.

98
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,958
 now they spray hot liquid soap 
     onto a big metal roll.     

99
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,693
    it solidifies in a flash,   

100
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,429
         and a big blade        
    scrapes it off the roll,    

101
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:15,300
    creating ribbons of soap.   

102
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,772
     the soap ribbons plunge    
         into a hopper,         

103
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,243
  where an auger moves the soap 
 along, sending it down a chute.

104
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,587
      the soap ribbons fall     
  all the way to the next floor 

105
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,190
      to big steel rollers      
          called mills.         

106
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:42,660
 they mix and compress the soap.

107
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,462
       a blade scrapes it       
         off the rollers        

108
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,930
 and cuts it into ribbons again,

109
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,667
     but these soap ribbons     
           are denser.          

110
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,216
     inside the next hopper,    
      another auger turns.      

111
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,022
  it pushes the soap through an 
 extruder called a noodle plate 

112
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,291
         that shapes it         
       into soap noodles.       

113
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,032
         as the noodles         
     fall from the extruder,    

114
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,203
they're collected in bins, which
  are then dumped into a mixer. 

115
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,910
  at this point, they add color 
   in powder and liquid form.   

116
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,319
     steel blades stir it up    

117
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,456
      until the color coats     
        the soap noodles.       

118
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:52,898
they add some fragrant oils, and
the blades toss it all together.

119
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,936
    when the batch is ready,    
        a trapdoor opens.       

120
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,607
    the blades keep turning,    
 nudging the soap out the door. 

121
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,946
        then it's forced        
  through another noodle plate. 

122
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,784
     this mixes up the batch    
         a little more.         

123
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,491
     next they push the soap    
    through a forming plate,    

124
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,493

          called slugs.         

127
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,111
 the soap slugs are on their way
       to the next stage.       

128
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,779
             they're            
   on a two-lane thoroughfare   

129
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,581
    heading into a die-press.   

130
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,384
     a mechanical arm pushes    
the slugs through an oval plate,

131
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,721
 trimming it and then loading it
          into the die.         

132
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:55,160
         the die rotates        
      to accept the slugs.      

133
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,800
   mechanical presses move in   
    to shape and stamp them.    

134
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,004
mechanical arms suction the bars
  to remove them from the die.  

135
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,543
 these mechanical pushers help. 

136
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,145
    they nudge the soap bars    

137
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,948
         out of the die         
  towards the suctioning arms.  

138
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:25,223
  the oval soap bars now travel 
   through a wrapping station.  

139
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,892
  a blade crimps and heat-seals 
        the plastic wrap        

140
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,362
       in one fell swoop.       

141
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,900
  then automated grippers grasp 
        the wrapped bars        

142
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,635
  and load them into a machine, 

143
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,071
        which slides them       
       into little boxes.       

144
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:48,546
  now it's time to pack them up 
 and ship them off to the store.

            narrator:           
   the story of the steel drum  

146
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,199
       begins in trinidad       
          in the 1930s,         

147
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,736
   when street-band skirmishes  
  led to the ban of skin drums. 

148
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,339
  so people improvised and made 
 drums from thick bamboo poles, 

149
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,943
        car parts, tins,        
   and, finally, oil barrels.   

150
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,881
           steel drums          
 have a very distinctive sound.

      [ steel drums play ]      

153
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,164
    when people first started   
 pounding on steel instruments, 

154
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,098
 they inadvertently dented them.

155
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,434
   that's how they discovered   

156
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,835
         that each dent         
   produced a different pitch.  

157
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,239
       so now steel drums       
 are created with the same idea.

158
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,442
  to make a drumhead, they cut  
 a piece of steel into a circle.

159
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,110
 they weld a metal ring onto it,

160
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,780
 and then they position a metal 
  shell, or skirt, on the ring  

161
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,483
      and weld it in place.     

162
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,188
 the drum is held in a big clamp

163
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,126
    while a worker pinpoints    
  the drumhead's exact center.  

164
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,665
            he places           
    a measuring guide there,    

165
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:19,404
  using it to mark radial lines 
   from the center to the rim.  

166
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,273
 each line is 10 degrees apart. 

167
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,850
   as the drum turns, he draws  
 circular lines to make a grid. 

168
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:38,022
  now he pounds the head of the 
  drum with a pneumatic hammer, 

169
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,626
  using the grid as a guide to  
 ensure the work is done evenly.

170
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,361
  it takes 8 hours of hammering 

171
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,231
      to transform the drum     
     into a bowl-like shape.    

172
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,633
this is called sinking the drum.

173
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,903
   then, with a special guide   
      for curved surfaces,      

174
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,771
          a technician          
    measures out another grid   

175
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,908
   inside the bowled drumhead.  

176
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,184
 he outlines the notes that are 
   about to be hammered out --  

177
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,487
          in this case,         
     a high "b" and an "e."     

178
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,992
 then he hammers down the steel 
         around each one        

179
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,327
       to shape the note.       

180
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,130
       getting this right       
 takes skill and a lot of time, 

181
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,833
         up to 50 hours.        

182
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,605
     he trims the drum skirt    
      to the correct length     

183
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,776
     and tapes a stencil of     
the company logo onto the skirt.

         this device is         
 an electrical etching machine. 

185
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,019
          it uses acid          
      and electric current      

186
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,788
      to eat away the steel     
  exposed through the stencil.  

187
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:58,036
     now a technician wields    
 an ultrasonic thickness probe. 

188
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,973
 she presses it against a note. 

189
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,108
              using             
   high-frequency sound waves,  

190
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,377
       the probe measures       
      the steel's thickness     

191
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,980
to within a fraction of an inch.

192

    she grinds down the notes   
          where needed.         

193
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,997
  then, using a scribing tool,  

194
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,267
      she scratches a line      
        around each note,       

195
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:33,671
      so it will be visible     
         to the player.         

196
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,608

          with a stick          

199
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:44,949
 and then dents it with a hammer
      to adjust the pitch.      

200
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,951
       you have to listen       
         very carefully.        

201
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,288
       he hammers the note      
     until it sounds right.     

202
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,823
  sometimes, he turns the drum  
           upside down          

203
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,727
       to knock out a note      
       from the underside.      

204
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,632
 for the fine-tuning, he relies 
     on an electronic tuner.    

205
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,768
          a microphone          
    delivers the sound to it,   

206
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,236
   and the lines on the screen  

207
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,206
      tell him if the note      
       is in tune or not.       

208
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:26,724
  next, he burns the border of  
   each note with a blowtorch.  

209
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,727
      then he cools it down     
           with water.          

210
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,331
 the process tempers the steel, 
 making the notes more resonant.

211
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,001
    he tunes the drum again,    
       checking for flaws.      

212
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:46,210
after the drum is chrome-plated,
    he tunes it a final time.   

213
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,081
     it has taken 120 hours

00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,071
      the florescent orange     

252
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,275
      makes the firefighter     
    more visible in daylight.   

253
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:02,146
    the reflective silver is    
 for nighttime or in the smoke. 

254
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,149
     in some cases, she adds    
   reflective die-cut letters   

255
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,917
 identifying the fire department

256
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,787
           or spelling          
     the firefighter's name.    

257
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,894
        a strip of velcro       
 goes onto the left front panel.

258
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,763
      it's one of four ways     
      to fasten the jacket,     

259
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,434
     in addition to zippers,    
        snaps, and hooks.       

260
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,504
   to keep water from entering  
through the front of the jacket,

261
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,572
           they attach          
   a strip of the same fabric   

262
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,844
              used              
  to make the moisture barrier. 

263
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,180
   a worker sews it inside the  
outer shell's right front panel,

264
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,584
  what's called the storm flap. 

265
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,522
   the storm flap's other side  
       gets a velcro strip      

266
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,358
   that mates with the velcro   
       on the left panel.       

267
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,663
  they attach the front panels  
       to the back panels.      

268
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,632
a worker folds the garment over,

269
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,802
         and the machine        
sews through two layers at once.

270
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:02,473
  it's another way to reinforce 
    the seams of the jacket.    

271
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,076
   they use a different sewing  
 machine to attach the sleeves. 

272
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,079
          a worker sews         
      five different seams      

273
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,414
   to join the shoulder areas.  

274
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,449
        this is critical        
      because firefighters      

275
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,353
    carry a 24-pound air tank   
         on their back.         

276
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,887
 the seams spread out the stress

277
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,524
       this weight places       
         on the jacket.         

278
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,628
        a worker attaches       
        three metal snaps       

279
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,829
       to the inside front      
       of the outer shell.      

280
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:31,302
   these will attach the outer  
 shell to the two inner layers. 

281
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,705
              then,             
a heat-resistant plastic zipper.

282
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,046
      this machine applies      
          three rivets          

283
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,115
             to each            
   of four spring-loaded hooks  

284
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,284
   along the right front panel  
         of the jacket.         

285
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,327
      a six-foot-long strap     
   cinches around the armpits   

286
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,597
 to drag an injured firefighter 
        away from danger.       

287
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,733
  a worker then snaps together  
   the assembled inner layers   

288
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,001
       to the outer shell.      

289
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,337
      there are four snaps      
          on each cuff,         

290
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,072
   which could heat up quickly  
           in a fire.           

291
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:12,476
   tabs ensure they never burn  
     the firefighter's skin.    

292
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:17,347
 the front panels come together 
  with four snaps on each side. 

293
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,150
  the four-inch collar unfolds, 

294
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,020
  covering the neck to where it 
 meets the firefighter's helmet.

295
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,288
        fully assembled,        

296
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,758
        the jacket weighs       
  about four and a half pounds. 

297
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,962
       this testing device      
  gauges how long it would take 

298
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,030
to sustain a second-degree burn.

299
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,299
   a gas burner shoots a flame  

300
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,902
         that's exactly         
    2,000 degrees fahrenheit    

301
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,837
   directly onto the jacket's   
          outer layer.          

302
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,375
   a heat sensor mimics human   
   skin's sensitivity to heat.  

303
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,245
   the material fails the test  
     if the transferred heat    

304
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,050
 would cause second-degree burns
  in less than 17 1/2 seconds.  

305
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,187
finally, they shower the uniform
         for 20 minutes         

306
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,522
  to test its watertight seal.  

307
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,392
       the dummy's wearing      
  a cotton bodysuit underneath. 

308
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,994
        just one wet spot       
        on the bodysuit,        

309
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:07,665
         and the uniform        
        fails inspection.       

310
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,338
