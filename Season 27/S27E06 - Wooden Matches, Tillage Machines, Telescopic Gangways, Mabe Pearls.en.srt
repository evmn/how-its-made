narrator:           
controlled use of fire by humans

6
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,055
dates back several hundred thousand years,

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,326
but the invention of matches is fairly recent.       

8
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,928
the first known use of matches 

9
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,998
dates back to the 5th century in northern china.       

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,133
and commercial safety matches were only invented       

11
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,302
in the early 19th century.   

12
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,406
you just need to rub a match head          

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:19,010
against the striking strip   
on the matchbox to start a fire.

14
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,481
matches come in a variety of matchbox formats.      

15
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,219
a linerboard paper roll feeds into a machine,     

16
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,621
passing under a hot iron    

17
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:33,091
to reduce the moisture level to 5% or 6%.          

18
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,030
an automatic paper roll match inner box machine like this one

19
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,166
can produce up to 55,000 liners per hour   

20
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,901
through high-speed die cutting,

21
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,904
folding, gluing, and forming. 

22
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,707
the speed of the process depends on the inner box's size

23
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,477
and on the paper's density.  

24
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:00,585
the machine shoots out     
formed inner boxes on a conveyor

25
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,055
at a dazzling rate of nearly 1,000 liners     

26
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:04,823
per minute.          

27
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,394
the conveyor then drops the formed liners    

28
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:13,198
into storage bins.       

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,935
an automatic sorting machine files the boxes in single rows 

30
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,137
and arranges them upright on the conveyors,       

31
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,939
feeding the filling machine.  

32
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,945
in the meantime, a worker feeds precut inserts      

33
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:30,215
to the outer box machine.   

34
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,617
high-speed die creasing and cutting tools 

35
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,287
automatically fold the inserts.

36
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,490
as the folded liners run through the rollers,    

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,627
the machine forms and glues the box skillets.  

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,034
each insert has two striking strips.    

39
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,570
in an industrial mixer,    

40
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:56,375
a worker pours gelatin capsules
over potassium chlorate.    

41
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,978
gelatin serves as a binder for the match head compound.  

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,646
the worker adds hot water   

43
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,716
before he starts the mixer to dissolve the gelatin,    

44
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,853
which combines itself with the potassium powder.   

45
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,656
the worker then adds silica granules,     

46
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:14,459
which act as a combustion-controlling agent.

47
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,995
he rinses the sides of the mixer with water    

48
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,465
as the compound mixture reduces.

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,335
after about 40 minutes, when the mixture is liquid,  

50
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,805
the worker adds red coloring as well as other compounds   

51
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:31,142
that make the match head burn more vigorously.     

52
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,213
on the splint production line, a worker inspects a batch   

53
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,348
of splintered aspen wood    

54
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,416
impregnated with ammonium phosphate    

55
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,419
to prevent afterglow.     

56
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,755
the splints run over perforated plates   

57
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,292
to shake off any residue or waste.     

58
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,693
then, they go through a machine

59
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:53,699
which automatically discards broken or undersized splints. 

60
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,235
the splints now reach the match-dipping line, 

61
00:03:56,237 --> 00:04:01,640
where the perforated steel match
bar runs down an endless chain.

62
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,910
the automatic feeder inserts over 2 million splints per hour

63
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,914
into the sockets of the match bar.       

64
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,318
the splints first get a paraffin coating.      

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,255
while a mixer keeps the match head compound liquid,

66
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,522
the loaded match bar      

67
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,658
lowers the splints to dip their heads in.     

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,062
after 5 seconds, the match bar moves back up.  

69
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,730
and the head compound mixture 

70
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,199
flows down into the mixing pan to be renewed         

71
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,036
before another section of the match bar moves in.   

72
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,474
after dipping,         

73
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,410
the splints keep rolling down the match bar chain for drying.

74
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:41,946
the chain loops up and down for about 1 hour,       

75
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,815
leaving the match head compound time  

76
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,753
to dry slowly and thoroughly. 

77
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,221
once the heads are dry,    

78
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,823
the finished matches are ready for packaging.    

79
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,096
but first, the filling machine routes   

80
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,898
the outer and inner matchbox liners        

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,101
onto parallel conveyors.    

82
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,502
on a high-speed line,     

83
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:09,441
the machine can process at least 500 boxes per minute. 

84
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,844
the finished matches finally come off the match bar.    

85
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:16,848
and the filling machine places them into the inside liner.  

86
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,984
at this point, the machine processes     

87
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,787
about 200 matches per second. 

88
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,056
the filling machine pushes the inner liner     

89
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,791
to the outer skillet.     

90
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,594
the machine is calibrated to fill each box        

91
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,262
with a set amount of matches  

92
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:35,000
and reject the extra ones.   

93
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,969
filled boxes come out on a packaging conveyor.    

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,074
you can find them in small cartons,       

95
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:45,543
medium-sized packages, or heavy duty crates.     

96
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,880
but it takes just a single match
to light your fire.      

97
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,457

00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,762
narrator: a tillage machine is 
a large tractor-pulled implement

99
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,565
which tills the soil.     

100
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,968
tillage can refer to deeply  
plowing the soil after a harvest

101
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,171
to break up clumps and remove plant remains.   

102
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,907
or it can refer to a shallow turning of soil  

103
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,009
to prepare the field for planting.         

104
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,849
this tillage machine is an agricultural multitasker.

105
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,252
its rotary disk blades turn the soil         

106
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,855
and chop up crop remnants.   

107
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,857
the harrow behind the blades rakes the soil.        

108
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,661
then, the rolling baskets   
at the rear smooth and level it.

109
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,931
the machine can be fitted with various blades designed  

110
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,134
for different soil conditions and crops.           

111
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,203
the first machine flattens the curve       

112
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,206
out of a just-unwound sheet of steel.           

113
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,142
then, a press stamps the sheet with a die,  

114
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:56,748
cutting out circular blades each 4 1/2 feet in diameter.  

115
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,684
the steel is a proprietary formula engineered       

116
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,553
to withstand high abrasion   

117
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,954
and to be flexible enough   

118
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:07,892
not to chip when the blades hit rocks in the soil.     

119
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,695
after machining a sharp edge, they heat the blades      

120
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,097
and form them in a die,    

121
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,500
simultaneously quenching with water.     

122
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,370
this tempers the steel so that it holds the shape.  

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,240
after cleaning, the blades           

124
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,309
go through a vat of water-based paint,     

125
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,844
then a furnace to cure the paint.       

126
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,113
the paint coat is simply    

127
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,715
to make the blades look snazzy in the showroom.  

128
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,518
once they actually hit the soil,
it wears off,         

129
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,987
which is intended, as bare steel moves      

130
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:39,724
through the ground more effectively.       

131
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,260
agricultural equipment plants like this one         

132
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,928
purchase the blades to install 

133
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,731
on the tillage machines they manufacture.       

134
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,866
this computer-guided plasma torch          

135
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,603
cuts the flat components of the machine's frame     

136
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,804
out of a thick steel sheet.  

137
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,274
other parts are cut from steel tubes.       

138
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,476
here, workers use a brake press

139
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,912
to punch holes for assembly bolts.      

140
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,683
once all the frame parts are ready,           

141
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,487
workers weld them together into frame sections.      

142
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,523
this is the main section.   

143
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,895
here, they're welding a cut-tube part        

144
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,297
to a pair of plasma-cut parts. 

145
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,440
once each frame section is welded,       

146
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,975
it goes to the paint room,   

147
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,310
where workers first sandblast the steel   

148
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,547
to clean off lubricating oil and other residues.      

149
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,785
they spray on primer and paint 

150
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,653
and put the frame section in an oven           

151
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,390
to simultaneously bake on both coats.      

152
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,860
given that tillage machine's work outdoors,         

153
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,795
the paint is designed to protect the steel      

154
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,831
from sunlight and corrosion.  

155
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,335
next, they install hydraulic cylinders      

156
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,536
on the main frame,       

157
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,006
attaching them with large bolts secured    

158
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:05,876
by washer-and-cotter-pin locking
mechanisms.          

159
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,812
the cylinders, made of a steel 

160
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,682
that has anticorrosion chemicals
baked into it,         

161
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,550
lift and fold the tillage machine      

162
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,087
before and after use.     

163
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,756
workers pump hydraulic fluid through the cylinders     

164
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,492
to test them.         

165
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,564
they bolt the other frame section, called the subframe, 

166
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,466
to the front of the main frame.

167
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,770
then, to the front of the subframe,        

168
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,706
they install a hitch.     

169
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,574
this is what connects the tillage machine      

170
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,910
to the tractor.        

171
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,579
not only does the hitch have to be exceptionally strong

172
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,781
to withstand the pull of the tractor,        

173
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,984
it must also be flexible    

174
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,120
because the tillage machine runs over bumpy terrain.    

175
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,723
for the same reason,      

176
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,793
the main frame has two pivoting axles.    

177
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,464
workers install two wheels with tires on each one.    

178
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,667
these tires are 3 feet in diameter.          

179
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,603
tires can be larger or smaller 

180
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,205
depending on the overall size of the machine         

181
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,174
and where they're positioned on it.       

182
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,478
workers now mount the bracket 

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
to which they'll attach the harrow.       

184
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,754
then, they install the harrow 

185
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,889
and the rolling baskets behind it.           

186
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,562
these and many other components

187
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,031
are mounted with sturdy steel u-bolts,   

188
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,568
plated with zinc for corrosion resistance.   

189
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,706
one last time, workers hook up the tillage machine  

190
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,775
to a hydraulic fluid pump for testing.          

191
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,711
there are two hydraulic circuits,      

192
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,247
each activated by a lever.   

193
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,449
one folds or unfolds the machine.    

194
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,518
the other raises or lowers it. 

195
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,255
this tillage machine is    
an agricultural triple threat --

196
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,058
blades to churn up the ground, 

197
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,826
harrow tines to rake it           

198
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,597
and heavy steel rolling baskets
to level the farming field.

to allow passengers or cargo to be loaded or unloaded.   

202
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,281
they're also known as gangplanks,         

203
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,682
hearkening back to the days  

204
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,552
when these bridges were simple wood planks.    

205
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,487
today, telescopic gangways   

206
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,023
extend and retract automatically.         

207
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,229
telescopic gangways can extend their reach or shorten it   

208
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,098
and change the angle, too.   

209
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,968
they'll also fold up      
for compact storage on the ship.

210
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,436
these are gangways       

211
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,707
that can adjust to different circumstances.  

212
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,042
each model starts with a computer design,    

213
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:58,783
one that takes an engineer up to 800 hours to devise.   

214
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:03,254
once all the details have been worked out, production begins. 

215
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,056
using a crane with air clamps, 

216
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,859
they transfer an aluminum plate
to a laser cutting station.  

217
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,130
the gangway design has been loaded into a computer

218
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,197
that guides the tooling    

219
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,801
to cut out parts according to the plan.     

220
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,936
in this case, it cuts out a panel      

221
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,005
that will be made into a framework        

222
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,974
for one of the gangway planks. 

223
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,349
workers then serve up the panel
to a computerized brake press. 

224
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:36,020
the press bears down on the part
to make 90-degree-angle bends. 

225
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:40,825
this transforms the flat panel into the plank framework.   

226
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:44,028
next, tools carve thicker aluminum into hinges  

227
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,431
for raising and lowering the gangway.          

228
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,369
a drill bores a hole in each hinge for the pin.   

229
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,903
with another bit, the machine 

230
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,840
sculpts a countersink profile around the hole.        

231
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,844
they're now ready to assemble the hinges     

232
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,848
and other components to the plank framework.    

233
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,852
a worker positions a reinforcing
bracket on the framework.   

234
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,554
he clamps the bracket to a hollow metal cube     

235
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,858
to keep it correctly aligned to the framework.       

236
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,262
he welds the bracket      
to the framework from the inside

237
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,663
and then assembles another bracket        

238
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:22,132
to the other side.       

239
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,668
he slides a metal subfloor into the top grooves      

240
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,604
of the gangway plank structure.

241
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,440
this subfloor will support teakwood decking.       

242
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,479
he inserts flat bars between the framework     

243
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,813
and the subfloor        

244
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,283
to create a space for the installation of the teak. 

245
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,686
he welds the rails to the plank structure     

246
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:46,090
and then adds supports for wheels.          

247
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,893
the thick welds look a bit unsightly.     

248
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,729
so a worker grinds the seams smooth.    

249
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,302
he also abrades the entire metal structure   

250
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,405
to give it a brushed texture that paint will adhere to.   

251
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,911
painting is an intensive process.     

252
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,981
they prime each gangway plank body three times        

253
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,783
with sandings in between.   

254
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:19,323
they also give the planks three coats of paint.     

255
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,993
this particular gangway is being custom-made      

256
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,628
for a luxury yacht.      

257
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,268
after assembling the teak decking to the planks,

258
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,604
a detail person sands the surface.       

259
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,007
this ensures that the synthetic rubber caulking 

260
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,910
between the planks is flush to the wood.     

261
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,616
he caulks the space between the decking      

262
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:48,152
and the metal plank structure using more synthetic rubber.  

263
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,825
with a putty knife, he scrapes off the excess   

264
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,228
and forms a neat, concave profile.        

265
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,232
after a 24-hour cure, he removes the tape      

266
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,634
that's protected the metal frame        

267
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,336
and wood decking during the caulking process.  

268
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,442
they're now ready to assemble the planks into a gangway.   

269
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,579
they move the upside-down planks
into position         

270
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,981
and then drive thick pins into the hinges        

271
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,284
to attach one plank to the next.

272
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,587
he then installs the hydraulic cylinder     

273
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,125
that powers the folding mechanism.     

274
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,261
he links it to the hinges with a long, thick pin.    

275
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,799
he equips one section of the gangway         

276
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,868
with telescoping hydraulics  

277
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,737
that allow the gangway to extend and retract.     

278
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,342
he runs the hoses for the hydraulic fluids    

279
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,478
through the gangway into the cylinder.       

280
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,080
and he installs locking valves 

281
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,482
to ensure the cylinder stays in position       

282
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,551
when a load is applied.    

283
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,820
the gangway is now completely assembled.     

284
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,757
they secure one end in a thick concrete fixture  

285
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,428
to simulate the weight     
of the yacht it's been made for.

286
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,830
this allows them to fully test the telescoping action     

287
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,233
and the load-bearing capacity. 

288

seven months in the making,  

289

this gangway is now ready to go to any length

00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,366
natural pearls are slightly gritty and very delicate.   

306
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:19,637
even gentle rubbing can remove the precious nacre layer.   

307
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:24,375
mabe pearls are flat-bottomed, semispherical cultured pearls. 

308
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,310
they grow attached to the inner shell       

309
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,578
of a pearl oyster       

310
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,449
when a foreign object is implanted in a shell.    

311
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:36,787
in the nursery, oysters start their lives as tiny larvae.  

312
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,322
when the larvae are big enough,

313
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,059
they can be released outside in the pearl culturing farm.  

314
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,729
the farm is actually a big raft structure      

315
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,665
that floats on the sea.    

316
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,001
oyster larvae naturally attach themselves  

317
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,203
to natural or man-made structures,    

318
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,874
at which point they start growing their shell.

319
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,944
this net acts as a trap for the developing oysters.  

320
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,814
juveniles are moved to underwater cages,      

321
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,817
where they will grow for several months.      

322
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,954
the oyster on the right is about 6 months old.     

323
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,623
in another 6 months,      
it will be large enough to start

324
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:17,628
growing a pearl, suspended on ropes underwater. 

325
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,830
to grow a pearl,        

326
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:23,768
each oyster must first receive a plastic nucleus.   

327
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,371
workers use wedges and speculums
to keep the shells open    

328
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,240
as they work.         

329
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:31,842
they gently move the animal to the side,          

330
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,580
looking for a suitable position
for the nucleus implantation. 

331
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:40,384
the nucleus size depends on the size of the oyster.   

332
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,719
following implantation, the oyster           

333
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:47,725
will start secreting nacre   
over the surface of the nucleus.

334
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,661
workers drill a hole in the oyster's hinge.     

335
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,130
this does not hurt the animal. 

336
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,101
they fasten each shell to a rope
using stainless steel wire.  

337
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,606
each rope holds between three and five oysters.       

338
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,479
they fasten those ropes to the raft structure.     

339
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,081
oysters will spend at least another year underwater,    

340
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,951
feeding on plankton and growing the pearl.     

341
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,488
every 2 or 3 months,      

342
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,358
they remove the oysters from the water to clean them. 

343
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,096
tropical waters are rich in food
and teeming with life.     

344
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,498
so each oyster becomes a microhabitat     

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,967
for smaller plants and animals.

346
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,036
these organisms could prevent the oyster shell        

347
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,541
from opening and closing freely,
hampering its feeding.     

348
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,779
using a cleaver knife, they eliminate the thick crust 

349
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,249
of sea moss, barnacles, and other marine organisms.  

350
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,987
once the oysters have grown to a suitable size,      

351
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,457
it's time to harvest the pearls.

352
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,661
using a thin paring knife, she opens the oysters     

353
00:19:56,663 --> 00:20:00,797
and removes the animals from their shells.       

354
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,868
mabe pearls are most often used
in certain rings or earrings, 

355
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,673
where their dome shape is desirable.         

356
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:09,974
using a diamond saw,      

357
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,076
they cut the shell around the pearl.       

358
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,547
after cutting, the nucleus will be removed and replaced  

359
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,151
with a mixture of resin to improve strength and luster.

360
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,688
they use a grinding machine to shape the pearl.      

361
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,626
then, they polish it to enhance
its natural beauty.      

362
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,828
jewelers working with pearls arrange them          

363
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,765
according to size and quality. 

364
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,566
this artisan is creating a tiara

365
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,037
for an international beauty pageant.        

366
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,040
she uses a magnifying glass to control the quality     

367
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:47,178
of the various gemstones and pearls.          

368
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,512
for other jewelry pieces,   

369
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:54,051
they use spherical pearls, such as this south sea pearl. 

370
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,254
they insert a miniature screw in the hole.          

371
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,791
that screw is endowed with   
a proprietary double-lock system

372
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:04,729
which secures the pearl in its setting.        

373
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,864
the pearl farmers have been growing pearls    

374
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,133
for three generations.     

375
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,403
today, they farm three species of oysters    

376
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:16,707
and produce a total of about 25,000 pearls every year.   

377
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,746
even though cultured pearls require human intervention,  

378
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,547
they are all real pearls.   

379
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,018
their color, luster and shape may vary slightly.  

380
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,955
but each pearl is unique and naturally beautiful.
