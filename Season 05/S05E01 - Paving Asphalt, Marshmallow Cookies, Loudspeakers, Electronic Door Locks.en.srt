00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,745
they glue and screw the pieces  
together because the bond has to
be strong enough to withstand   

316
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,247

340
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,063
the core fits through the large

00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,698
magnet.                         
an electromagnet is an          
object that generates a magnetic

359
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,132
an electromagnet is an          
object that generates a magnetic

360
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,968
object that generates a magnetic
field only when there's a       
current running through it.     

361
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,869
field only when there's a       
current running through it.     
they wind enamel-insulated      

362
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,738
current running through it.     
they wind enamel-insulated      
copper wire, gluing it to a     

363
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,040
they wind enamel-insulated      
copper wire, gluing it to a

the positive pole of this       

365
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,643
rigid plastic sheet.            
the positive pole of this       
voice coil will be attracted to 

366
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,278
the positive pole of this       
voice coil will be attracted to 
the negative pole of the        

367
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,612
voice coil will be attracted to 
the negative pole of the

368
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,714
the negative pole of the

the negative poles will repel   

369
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,582

the negative poles will repel   
each other.                     
the key is that the voice coil's

00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,586
each other.                     
the key is that the voice coil's
poles are constantly reversing  

372
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,321
the key is that the voice coil's
poles are constantly reversing  
position because the electrical 

373
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,989
poles are constantly reversing  
position because the electrical 
current running to the speaker  

374
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,458
position because the electrical 
current running to the speaker  
is an alternating current,      

375
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,359
current running to the speaker  
is an alternating current,      
meaning it switches between a   

376
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,062
is an alternating current,      
meaning it switches between a   
positive and negative charge    

377
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,665
meaning it switches between a   
positive and negative charge    
several times per second.       

378
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,267
positive and negative charge    
several times per second.       
this makes the magnets attract  

379
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,467
several times per second.       
this makes the magnets attract  
and repel each other            

380
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,835
this makes the magnets attract  
and repel each other            
continuously, causing the       

381
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,304
and repel each other            
continuously, causing the       
voice coil to move back and     

382
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,572
continuously, causing the       
voice coil to move back and     
forth rapidly.

voice coil to move back and     
forth rapidly.                  
this vibrates the cone, which   

384
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,612
forth rapidly.                  
this vibrates the cone, which   
creates sound waves.            

385
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,280
this vibrates the cone, which   
creates sound waves.            
after slipping the voice coil

00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,756
rings that move with the        
voice coil and prevent it from  
rubbing on the magnetic

00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,698
it's usually made of cardboard, 
plastic, or metal.              
then solder the electrical      

397
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,598
plastic, or metal.              
then solder the electrical

00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,441
swipe the right card, and they  
permit the latch to retract.    
after applying more lubricant,  

500
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,176
permit the latch to retract.    
after applying more lubricant,  
they install an override that   

501
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,844
after applying more lubricant,  
they install an override that   
enables the hotel to open the   

502
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,546
they install an override that   
enables the hotel to open the   
door with a key, if, for some   

503
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,914
enables the hotel to open the   
door with a key, if, for some   
reason, the electronics

door with a key, if, for some   
reason, the electronics         
malfunction.                    

505
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,120
reason, the electronics         
malfunction.                    
they install the circuit board  

506
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,488
malfunction.                    
they install the circuit board  
and connect it to the various   

507
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,257
they install the circuit board  
and connect it to the various   
parts it controls, such as the  

508
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,192
and connect it to the various   
parts it controls, such as the  
clutch motor, which they install

509
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,927
parts it controls, such as the  
clutch motor, which they install
next.                           

510
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,695
clutch motor, which they install
next.                           
now they close up the completed 

511
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,930
next.                           
now they close up the completed 
housing with the steel          

512
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:53,830
now they close up the completed 
housing with the steel          
back plate.                     

513
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,800
housing with the steel          
back plate.                     
this protects the components    

514
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,401
back plate.                     
this protects the components    
inside from rusting.            

515
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,536
this protects the components    
inside from rusting.            
the last step is to insert a    

516
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,604

the last step is to insert a    
battery pack.                   

517
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,673
the last step is to insert a    
battery pack.                   
it holds three standard double-a

518
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:06,344
battery pack.                   
it holds three standard double-a
batteries.                      

519
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,245
it holds three standard double-a
batteries.                      
the factory tests the lock using

520
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,080
batteries.                      
the factory tests the lock using
a test key card because the lock

521
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,715
the factory tests the lock using
a test key card because the lock
isn't yet programmed to work    

522
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,283
a test key card because the lock
isn't yet programmed to work    
with a specific card.           

523
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:18,388
isn't yet programmed to work    
with a specific card.           
that's done after installation. 

524
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,957
with a specific card.           
that's done after installation. 
elsewhere in the factory, they  

525
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,592
that's done after installation. 
elsewhere in the factory, they  
assemble the mortise -- the part

526
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,227
elsewhere in the factory, they  
assemble the mortise -- the part
of the lock that goes inside the

of the lock that goes inside the
door.                           

528
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,696
of the lock that goes inside the
door.                           
when you lock up, the mortise's

door.                           
when you lock up, the mortise's 
bolt comes out of the door's    

530
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,566
when you lock up, the mortise's 
bolt comes out of the door's    
edge and fits into the hole of a

531
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,569
bolt comes out of the door's    
edge and fits into the hole of a
receiving piece, called a strike

532
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,838
edge and fits into the hole of a
receiving piece, called a strike
plate, in the door frame.       

533
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:55,892
they close up the mortise with  
the back plate.                 
this demonstration shows how

536
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,964
they install the mortise in the 
door.                           
once it's in, they screw a      

537
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,201
door.                           
once it's in, they screw a      
decorative plate on top.        

538
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:17,648
this is what the finished       
electronic door looks like.     
key cards have instructions on

key cards have instructions on  
one side, a magnetic data stripe

540
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,952
key cards have instructions on  
one side, a magnetic data stripe
on the other.                   

541
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,654
one side, a magnetic data stripe
on the other.                   
they use a generic card to test 

542
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,222
on the other.                   
they use a generic card to test 
every lock that comes off the

production line.                
in the quality-control lab, they
subject every new design to     

546
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,234
in the quality-control lab, they
subject every new design to     
several rigorous tests.         

547
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,435
they open and close 1 million   

548
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,205
times.                          

549
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,041
they subject the lever, latch,  

550
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:50,180
and lock to repeated impacts.   

551
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,082
they also test lock function in 

552
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,620
extreme temperatures.           

553
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,656
these electronic door locks come

554
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,857
in several metal finishes plated

555
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,626
over the zinc and even in a     

556
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,594
painted finish that simulates
