      narrator: every day,      

4
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,922
       millions of people       
 around the world use escalators

5
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,992
  in places like shopping malls 
          and airports.         

6
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:03,862
 escalators can move 100 or more
   people just as easily as 1.  

7
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,799
       driven by a motor,       
     these moving stairways     

8
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,069
     make it very convenient    
    for people to get around.   

9
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,208
  riding an escalator is easy,  

10
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,878
   but building the smoothest   
  and most quiet ride possible  

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,746
        takes expertise.        

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,017
            it starts           
  with workers welding together 

13
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,620
    the structural framework    
        of the escalator.       

14
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,154
   like the chassis of a car,   

15
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,024
        the track system        
    and all other components    

16
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,293
  will be bolted to this frame. 

17
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,566
     a worker puts together     
      the main drive gear,      

18
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:43,102
    which hooks up to a motor   
          with a chain.         

19
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:47,305
     it will pull the steps     
       and the handrails.       

20
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,375
           he puts on           
    an emergency-brake device   

21
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,279
         and uses bolts         
     to secure it in place.     

22
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,251
     he attaches side frames    
           to the gear          

23
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,187
     to make what is called     
    the transition assembly.    

24
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,391
     this assembly includes     
  a drive gear for the handrail 

25
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,660
      and allows the steps      
          to loop back          

26
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,796
 at both ends of the escalator. 

27
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,532
  he then lowers the completed  
       transition assembly      

28
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,536
  into the truss -- the hollow  
  structure of the escalator.   

29
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:27,279
  with the transition assembly  
            in place,           

30
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,148
      workers then install      
         a comb plate --        

31
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,483
 the last part of the escalator 
        a person steps on       

32
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,153
       before getting onto      
        the moving steps.       

33
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,622
    a worker makes the steps    
     using aluminum ingots,     

34
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,759
 which he puts into a crucible. 

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,496
 they then apply a release agent

36
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,499
           to the mold          
     used to make the steps.    

37
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,703
     spraying more lubricant    
           on the mold          

38
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,172
   ensures the aluminum stair   
      will release properly     

39
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,907
   from the die-cast machine,   

40
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,842
  which automatically receives  

41
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,911
        the exact amount        
    of molten aluminum needed   

42
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,681
        to make one step.       

43
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:10,989
a robot then takes the one-piece
 step from the die-cast machine 

44
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,726
         and carries it         
   to the trimming department.  

45
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,398
       here, a trim press       
 removes some residual aluminum.

46
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:30,743
  the excess material goes back 
 to the crucible to be recycled.

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,081
     once the robot finishes    
 a general trimming of the step,

48
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,651
           it sends it          
  to the finishing department.  

49
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,093
     there, finishing robots    
 then file off the sharp edges. 

50
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,233
      the robot also files      
      in between the teeth      

51
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,801
    that go across the step.    

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,707
     then it passes the step    
       over a belt sander,      

53
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,410
 making it smooth to the touch. 

54
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,519
 transformed from solid aluminum

55
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,455
          to a casting          
 that is painted and assembled, 

56
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,392
      the step is now ready     
        to be installed.        

57
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:24,396
   a worker rolls out a chain   
 of rollers called a step chain.

58
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,266
    he greases all the pins.    

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,403
  then they place all the steps 
         into position.         

60
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,078
      workers then connect      
     the axles on the steps     

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
  to the pins in the step chain 

62
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,717
   and then lock them together  
      using a spring clip.      

63
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:52,725
they feed the required length of
 chain and steps into the unit. 

64
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,234
     a worker then attaches     
       a turnaround track.      

65
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,170
      the turnaround track      
   allows the length of steps   

66
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,705
    to make a continuous loop   

67
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,475
  from one end of the escalator 
          to the other.         

68
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,379
       the escalator runs       
      for about five hours      

69
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,117
      to ensure it operates     
      quietly and properly.     

70
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,118
   during this testing period,  

71
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,423
    it goes through up to 250   
     quality-control checks.    

72
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,464
  after passing all the tests,  

73
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,268
      workers wrap the unit     
     in heat-shrink plastic.    

74
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,937
   the escalator is now ready   
   to load on a flatbed truck   

75
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,373
  for delivery to the customer. 

76
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,089
            narrator:           
   your canoe may well be made  

77
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,559
  of the same material they use 
   to make bulletproof vests.   

78
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,694
          that's right.         

79
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,830
        many canoes today       
are made of woven aramid fibers,

80
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,232
          better known          
   by the trade name "kevlar."  

81
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,902
       for canoes, though,      
   they use a lesser density,   

82
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:13,839
       since, presumably,       
 no one will be shooting at you.

83
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,445
         a kevlar canoe         

84
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,582
    weighs about half as much   
 as a wooden or aluminum canoe, 

85
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,185
       and it's virtually       
       maintenance-free.        

86
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,324
  they build these canoes from  
 several layers of kevlar fabric

87
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,895
    glued together to create    
   a solid laminate material.   

88
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:42,000
 it all begins with a fiberglass
    mold of the canoe's hull.   

89
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,404
   the first step is to spread  
    resin over its interior.    

90
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,605
        once that's done,       

91
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,074
  they spread a sheet of kevlar 
         over the resin         

92
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,212
  and rub it against the mold   
  to push out any air bubbles.  

93
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:57,216
       then they trim off       
       the excess fabric.       

94
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:01,086
        using a squeegee,       
 they force out any excess resin

95
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,422
     and stretch the fabric     
        until it's taut.        

96
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:07,693
 this step ensures the laminate 
will turn out strong and smooth.

97
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:12,764
 they repeat this entire process
 with a second layer of kevlar, 

98
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,167
        then run a roller       
         over everything        

99
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,902
    to expel any excess resin   

100
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,105
      and press the layers      
        tightly together.       

101
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,975
             now for            
   some structural components.  

102
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:27,713
pieces of thin high-density foam
go along the bottom of the hull.

103
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:31,350
 glue bonds them to each other  
 and to the bottom of the hull. 

104
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,653
         using a machine        
        called a hot box,       

105
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:40,526
       they begin heating       
  strips of foam to curve them. 

106
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:43,395
       these curved pieces      
        are called ribs.        

107
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,999
    they reinforce the sides,   
      adhering with resin.      

108
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,137
    with the structural core    
     of the canoe complete,     

109
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,407
       they now encase it       
   in a third layer of kevlar.  

110
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,942
        once that's down,       

111
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,545
 they prepare to bond everything
 together with vacuum pressure. 

112
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,681
          they lay down         
     a sheet of white fabric    

113
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,683
           impregnated          
     with a nonstick coating    

114
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,753
    to prevent the vacuum bag   
  from sticking to the surface. 

115
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,689
    this mesh, called scrim,    
          goes on next.         

116
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,393
   it helps stimulate airflow   
   during that vacuum process.  

117
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:20,366
     now they tape a plastic    
   vacuum bag around the mold,  

118
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,434
   sealing everything inside.   

119
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,838
    then they connect one end   
      of a hose to the bag      

120
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,309
        and the other end       
      to a vacuum machine.      

121
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:34,245
  the vacuum steadily draws out 
  the air from within the bag,  

122
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,483
  pulling the layers of kevlar  
        tightly together.       

123
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:47,860
       after 8 to 10 hours      
under vacuum, the bag comes off.

124
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,263
     if a canoe flips over,     

125
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,399
 flotation tanks in the corners 
         keep it afloat.        

126
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:59,004
 workers build each tank out of 
 two pieces of low-density foam.

127
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,473
       after sanding them       
       to the right shape,      

128
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,276
        they lay a sheet        
   of fiberglass mat over them  

129
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,811
     and coat it with resin.    

130
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,479
    this strengthens the foam   

131
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,082
    and seals the two pieces    
         into one unit.         

132
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,285
      after the resin cures     
          for an hour,          

133
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,422
     they extract the canoe     
         from the mold.         

134
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:23,495
  the factory's quality-control 
    inspector checks it over    

135
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,963
   and, if everything's okay,   

136
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,399
    applies a protective coat   
            of resin.           

137
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,969
        once that's dry,        

138
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,972
     they cap the edges with    
aluminum strips called gunwales,

139
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,574
       which keep the hull      
     from folding inward...     

140
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,977
   then an aluminum crossbeam   

141
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,781
       and a nylon end cap      
         on each end...         

142
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,184
   a wooden yoke for carrying   
  the canoe upside down on land 

143
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,588
        and a wooden seat       
       with nylon webbing.      

144
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:57,329
     workers rivet all these    
   components to the gunwales,  

145
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,333
     then rivet the gunwales    
securely to the kevlar laminate.

146
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,606
 this factory puts every canoe  
 it produces on a digital scale 

147
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,543
       to ensure it meets       
     weight specifications.     

148
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,948
         if all is well,        
 the finishing touch is a decal 

149
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,785
           displaying           
    the manufacturer's name.    

150
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:25,090
    kevlar canoes, like those   
    made of other materials,    

151
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,893
vary in size, shape, and design.

152
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,098
  a canoe intended for fishing  
    or hunting, for example,    

153
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,367
   is quite different than one  
  designed for long expeditions 

154
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,970
 or for a two-person racing team

155
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,473
     or for a solo canoeist.    

156
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,727
            narrator:           
    goat cheese tastes tarter   
than cheese made from cow's milk

157
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,995
       because goat's milk      
     has a higher proportion    

158
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,398
     of certain fatty acids,    
    which sharpen the flavor.   

159
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,200
     there are hard and soft    
    varieties of goat cheese.   

160
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,803
 the soft ones are usually sold 
        in logs or disks        

161
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,873
    and often have a coating    
 of peppercorns, chopped herbs, 

162
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,875
      or other flavorings.      

163
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,013
 the texture of soft goat cheese

164
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,349
         makes it ideal         
    for spreading on crackers   

165
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,686
          or crumbling          
      over pasta or salads.     

166
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,021
           goat cheese          
    is also called "chèvre,"    

167
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,690
   the french word for "goat."  

168
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:35,360
  farmers start breeding goats  
when the animals are a year old.

169
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,896
     their gestation period     
       lasts five months,       

170
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,764
 meaning milk production begins 

171
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,101
           at the age           
   of about a year and a half.  

172
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:47,572
   the goats go for a milking   
      every 12 hours or so.     

173
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,642
  the first step is to manually 
   squirt some milk into a cup  

174
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,911
      to check the quality.     

175
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,714
   if it looks good, they wipe  
   the teats with disinfectant  

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,718
   to remove surface bacteria.  

177
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,155
        then they hook up       
  the automated milk extractor. 

178
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,368
         a milking takes        
   just two or three minutes.   

179
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,540
       it typically yields      
         2 to 3 quarts.         

180
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,545
     at the cheese factory,     
         the goat's milk        

181
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,350
    goes into a steam-heated    
      pasteurization tank.      

182
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:35,420
   an agitator stirs the milk   
nonstop to keep it from cooking.

183
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,425
       they heat the milk       
     to 66 degrees celsius,     

184
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,028
  which kills off any bacteria. 

185
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,501
 with the milk now pasteurized, 
  they add bacterial cultures.  

186
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,037
        these kick-start        
        the fermentation.       

187
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,374
      then they add rennet.     

188
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:56,574
        diluted in water,       

189
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,378
      rennet is an extract      
      from calf stomachs.       

190
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,281
       it contains enzymes      
       which curdle milk.       

191
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,451
with the cultures and rennet in,

192
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,454
workers now let the milk ferment
          for 18 hours.         

193
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,960
   the result -- cheese curds   
and a watery liquid called whey.

194
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,533
    they ladle out the curds    

195
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,038
        and put them in a       
 cheesecloth bag to strain them.

196
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,144
      as they lift the bag,     
  the sheer weight of the curds 

197
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:35,947
           forces out           
   much of the remaining whey.  

198
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,492
       they tie up the bag      

199
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,427
      and let the curds sit     
      for another 18 hours,     

200
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,632
        after which time        
   workers strain them again.   

201
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,234
         the goat cheese        
        is finally ready.       

202
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,569
          they weigh it         

203
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:01,372
    and mix in just the right   
  proportion of salt -- 0.6% -- 

204
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,575
 to slow down the aging process.

205
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:13,384
 one of the formats this factory
 produces is 175-gram packages, 

206
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,589
      so workers weigh out      
   175-gram blobs of cheese...  

207
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,994
   ...then hand-roll each blob  
           into a ball          

208
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,430
     then flatten each ball     
          into a disk.          

209
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,609
the disk goes into refrigeration
      until packaging time.     

210
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,077
     the fridge temperature     
     is 3 degrees celsius --    

211
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,147
      just above freezing.      

212
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:49,020
 some goat cheeses go for a roll
     in special flavorings.     

213
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,655
        these are chives.       

214
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:01,099
 then it's into cellophane wrap 
    and a plastic container.    

215
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,635
      on the product label,     
they stamp a "best before" date.

216
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:09,040
      unopened, goat cheese     
  has a two-month shelf life... 

217
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,443
   once opened, about a week.   

218
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,579
  another format is log-shaped. 

219
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,914
            they roll           
     this particular variety    

220
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,151
   in a five-pepper seasoning.  

221
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,794
     workers also hand-roll     
       goat-cheese balls.       

222
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,462
    they go into a container    

223
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,934
with spices, sun-dried tomatoes,
         and olive oil.         

224
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,736
 goat cheese is a healthy food. 

225
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:41,139
    it has twice the protein    
   of cow's-milk cream cheese   

226
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:46,278
yet half the fat and cholesterol
     and 1/3 fewer calories.

    narrator: ipods may rule    
      in this digital age,      

228
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,532
       but there's nothing      
       quite like a melody      

229
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,968
  that's mechanically generated 
         by a music box.        

230
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,570
  it's why, more than a century 
        after its heyday,       

231
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,707
          the music box         
  still holds a special appeal. 

232
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,211
       its musical chimes       
  take us back to another time.

         swirling dolls,        

235
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,255
   and luxurious cabinetry --   

236
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:36,060
  the music box is the original 
   home-entertainment system.   

237
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,063
        today, they make        
    these authentic replicas    

238
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,798
    with computerized tools.    

239
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,269
       they contour a gear      
   for this spring-wound motor  

240
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,337
  and then carve teeth into it. 

241
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,141
      this gear is similar      
 to the type used in clockworks.

242
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,011
      it's a windup device.     

243
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,147
         next, they coil        
  a 20-foot-long strip of steel 

244
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,283
 into a little cast-iron barrel.

245
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,685
 this is called a spring barrel,

246
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:05,423
 and it's the device that stores
 the wound-up mechanical energy.

247
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:07,625
  once the clutch is installed, 

248
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,628
        it will be ready        
     to spring into action.     

249
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,833
       this circular blade      
     now sculpts the weights    

250
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,971
 that extend from the base teeth
      of the musical comb.      

251
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,906
  the weights are called leads, 

252
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,843
      and they help produce     
         the low notes.         

253
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:30,381
 to tune the base, a technician 
  snips the ends of the leads.  

254
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,251
       she plucks a tooth       
       to produce a note,       

255
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:37,522
  then measures its pitch with  
  an electronic-tuning machine. 

256
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,658
         she adjusts it         
   by clipping off a bit more.  

257
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,261
    this process is critical.   

258
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,131
 it ensures each of the 76 teeth
       on the musical comb      

259
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,801
  will hit all the right notes. 

260
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:54,606
 there's a damper for each tooth
     to quell its vibration.    

261
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,610
 they install these dampers on a
 rail next to the star wheels --

262
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:01,913
 the part that plucks the teeth 
 of the comb to produce notes.  

263
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,018
      the technician aligns     
 the dampers to the star wheels 

264
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,055
      and bolts everything      
      to a cast-iron plate      
      called the bedplate.      

265
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,425
   using a pincers-like tool,   

266
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,929
  he checks the tension of the  
 dampers and makes adjustments. 

267
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,303
  now he secures the upper comb 
         to the bedplate        

268
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,307
       and turns it around      
   to install the lower comb.   

269
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,910
   music boxes with two combs   
         instead of one         

270
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,112
      have a richer sound.      

271
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,252
      the technician makes      
 more adjustments to the dampers

272
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,586
     to ensure a proper gap     

273
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:47,058
   between them and the teeth   
      of the musical comb.      

274
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,764
       he installs the bar      
 that holds down the music disk 

275
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,466
         while it plays,        

276
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:58,936
  then he bolts the motor frame 
   to the side of the cabinet,  

277
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,007
     followed by the winding    
      and disk-drive gears.     

278
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,480
  he attaches the spring barrel 
          to the gears.         

279
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,416
        here, he installs       
    a speed-control mechanism   

280
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,084
     for the winding gears.     

281
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,754
   it's called the "governor"   
  because it governs the speed. 

282
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,659
       he winds the motor       
to power it up for a test run...

283
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,829
...and then checks all its parts

284
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,498
           to confirm           
  the motor operates smoothly.  

285
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,568
       when he's satisfied      
          that it does,         

286
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,905
      it's time to install      
     the musical components,    

287
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,042
 beginning with the soundboard, 
   which amplifies the notes.   

288
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:40,044
       next, the bedplate,      
 with its double-comb assembly, 

289
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,114
 is mounted onto the soundboard.

290
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,250
   he screws support brackets   
           to the box.          

291
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,253
         they'll prop up        
        the musical disk.       

292
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,256
       he checks the setup      
       with a dummy disk.       

293
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:59,364
on a real disk, music is printed
  in the form of perforations.  

294
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,335
        this master disk        
      serves as a template      

295
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:07,605
         to punch holes         
 in a copper-plated disk below. 

296
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:16,080
    the punctures form curls    
  in the underside of the disk, 

297
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:20,485
 and it's these metal curls that
  will set the music in motion. 

298
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,420
          [ clicking ]          

299
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,425
       as the windup motor      
         turns the disk,        

300
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,828
           those curls          
      snag the star wheels.     

301
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,030
      [ soft music plays ]      

302
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:37,135
 the star wheels, in turn, pluck
 the teeth of the musical comb. 

303
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:46,244
    the music isn't digital,    
    but it's truly magical.     

304
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:51,249
 the music box is one technology
  that stands the test of time.
