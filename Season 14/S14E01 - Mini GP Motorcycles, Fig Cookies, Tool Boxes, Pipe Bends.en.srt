00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,720
           narrator:            
 they're called mini g.p.s --   

4
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,723
     pint-sized motorcycles     
   whose design is identical    

5
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,391
           to that of           
   the full-size motorbikes     

6
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,595
          that race on          
    the grand prix circuit.     

7
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:06,265
    mini g.p.s are designed     
  for kids 9 to 12 years old    

8
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,435
     who aspire to one day      
      race the big bikes.       

9
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:19,045
  a mini g.p. can reach speeds  
     of 80 miles per hour.      

10
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,884
          its chassis           
   is made of steel tubing,     

11
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:26,552
      to which they mount       
        the handlebars          

12
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:30,355
     along with the clutch      
       and brake levers.        

13
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:34,093
 at both the front and back of  
   the chassis, they attach a   
             fork.              

14
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,362
    then, between each fork     
       and the chassis,         

15
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,331
 they mount a shock absorber.   

16
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:48,174
       with a steel pin,        
   they mount a wheel on each   
             fork.              

17
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:51,811
 the black circle at the center 
       is a brake disk.         

18
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,049
       next, they install       
a brake caliper on each wheel.  

19
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,452
         when the rider         
      applies the brakes,       

20
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:03,389
  the caliper grabs the brake   
 disk, immobilizing the wheel.  

21
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,859
 now mechanics begin assembling 
       the engine block.        

22
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,862
     using a special tool,      
     they install bearings      

23
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,831
  that enable the gear shafts   
           to turn.             

24
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,538
   the engine has six gears,    

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,275
   each of which is comprised   
    of several steel gears.     

26
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,612
  these go into the gearbox.    

27
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,614
 next comes the gear shifter.   

28
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,016
     it connects the gears      
       to the gear pedal        

29
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,887
    that the rider operates     
        with his foot.          

30
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,222
       next they install        
        the crankshaft.         

31
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:40,092
      the combustion cycle      
    rotates the crankshaft,     

32
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,828
    which turns the gears.      

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,231
    they close up that side     
         of the engine          

34
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:48,300
    and assemble and install    
    the desmodromic spring.     

35
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,036
when the rider selects a gear,  

36
00:02:50,038 --> 00:02:52,638
      this spring keeps it      
      locked in position        

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,074
    until the rider switches    
             gears.             

38
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,579
 the engine turns a driveshaft  
  that, via this pinion gear,   

39
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,783
         moves a chain          
  that turns the rear wheel.    

40
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,451
    on the other side of the    
            engine,             

41
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,120
    they assemble the primary   
             couple             

42
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,923
   and the various components   
   that go into the clutch,     

43
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,192
     such as clutch plates      

44
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,829
   and the springs that stop    
  and start clutch movement.    

45
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,206
     when combustion drives     
    the piston up and down,     

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,742
  it rotates the crankshaft.    

47
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:34,280
  the primary couple transmits  
    power to the gearbox and    
            clutch.             

48
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,949
this is a one-cylinder engine.  

49
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,951
    they install the piston     
  that drives the crankshaft,   

50
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,755
    then mount the cylinder     
       over the piston.         

51
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:52,764
   they close up the cylinder   
     with a cylinder head,      

52
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,700
   then mount the spark plug    
that ignites the fuel mixture,  

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,503
    driving the piston up and   
             down.              

54
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,107
          a head cover          
     closes everything up.      

55
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,509
      next they install the     
           ignition.            

56
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,980
   it consists of two magnets   
 called a rotor and a stator.   

57
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:11,517
    when the rotor turns, it    
generates an electrical charge  

58
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,886
 that sets off the spark plug.  

59
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,724
        time to install         
     the finished engine.       

60
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,926
  they mount it to the chassis  
      with support pins,        

61
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,528
        front and back.         

62
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,069
   next they install the water  
              pump              

63
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,270
    that prevents the engine    
       from overheating         

64
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,508
      along with the belt       
     that drives the pump.      

65
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,144
       then they mount the      
          carburetor.           

66
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,613
       it mixes the fuel        
      entering the engine       

67
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,015
   with just the right amount   
            of air.             

68
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,752
       next they install        
        the air filter.         

69
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,222
      it keeps out debris       
  that would clog the engine.   

70
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,224
     now the exhaust pipe,      

71
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,425
        the fuel tank,          

72
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,493
           the seat,            

73
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,828
         and fairing,           

74
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,798
      a plastic enclosure       
   that shields the driver.     

75
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,036
   the final component is the   
             chain              

76
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,306
   connecting the driveshaft    
      to the rear wheel.        

77
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,248
  the engine turns the shaft,   

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,250
    which turns this chain,     

79
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,652
 which rotates the rear wheel.  

80
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,396
       mini g.p.s come in       
       different sizes.         

81
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:34,933
   this particular model has    
 a 50cc, 14-horsepower engine.  

82
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,237
       pretty impressive        
    for a kid's motorcycle.     

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,156
  narrator: the fig cookie is   
one of life's sweet mysteries.  

84
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:59,625
      who hasn't wondered       
     how they get the figs      

85
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,627
 in that seamless pastry wrap?  

86
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,297
      it turns out that the     
            automated           
    system for producing fig    
            cookies             

87
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,966
 actually dates back to 1891,   

88
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,737
    and it's what makes the     
fig cookie a snacking success.  

89
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,845
  fig cookies are a modern way  
     of packaging a fruit       

90
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,548
    which has been consumed     
        for millennia.          

91
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:28,653
 making the fig cookie's pastry 
    wrap begins with bags of    
             sugar,             

92
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:32,257
        which they empty        
       into a big mixer.        

93
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,560
      a couple of buckets       
     of corn syrup follow.      

94
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:39,131
         then they add          
 an emulsifier called lecithin  

95
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,233
  and some vanilla flavoring.   

96
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,205
       the bowl tilts up        
      for a quick mixing.       

97
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,275
         a worker adds          
      organic bread flour       

98
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,478
   and leavening ingredients    
          to the mix.           

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,748
  they reactivate the mixer,    

100
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,051
    which blends everything     
 into a thick, sticky batter.   

101
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,754
     once properly mixed,       

102
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,925
    they transfer the batter    
  into a large holding tank.    

103
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:12,497
           meanwhile,           
 they prepare the fig filling.  

104
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,901
   a worker loads big blocks    
     of figs into a mixer,      

105
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,436
  then adds a generous amount   
      of crumbled cookies       

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,440
    for texture and flavor.     

107
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,446
 they mix the two ingredients,  

108
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,183
    then pour in corn syrup     
to add moisture and sweetness.  

109
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:37,990
  they add some salt and give   
 the batch another quick mix.   

110
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:42,728
 they sweeten the fig mix some  
    more by adding plenty of    
             sugar.             

111
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,699
 and now the jam for the center 
of the fig cookie is complete.  

112
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,204
   the fig jam and the pastry   
    are now positioned for a    
            merger.             

113
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,474
   it will be a neat trick,     

114
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,510
     and a special piece of     
            equipment           
      makes it possible.        

115
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,283
   it's essentially a funnel    
       within a funnel.         

116
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,619
     rollers press the jam      
   through the inner funnel     

117
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,822
    while pushing the pastry    
    through the outer one,      

118
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,559
    encasing the fig filling    
 in a seamless pastry jacket.   

119
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,100
 here's the process in action.  

120
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:25,170
 the system generates long rows 
     of fig-filled dough,       

121
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,174
    and that's how they get     
  the fig jam in the pastry.    

122
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,116
       next a technician        
   carves through the dough     

123
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,952
   and removes a few uncooked   
         fig cookies.           

124
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,990
      it's time for a quick     
           weigh-in.            

125
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,193
         this confirms          
that this batch of fig cookies  

126
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,930
    will be exactly the right   
             size.              

127
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:55,334
  now it's into an oven that's  
 longer than a bowling alley.   

128
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,904
      it bakes and browns       
    the fig-filled ribbons of   
             dough.             

129
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,414
   here, a roller compresses    
       the baked cookies        

130
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,085
      so they'll fit into       
        packages later.         

131
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,753
    an ultrasonic frequency     

132
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,289
    makes this blade vibrate    
        for a clean cut         

133
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,560
    as it carves the rows of    
     fig-filled pastry into     
            cookies.            

134
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,897
   the fig cookies are still    
    a bit warm from baking,     

135
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,100
     so they now chill out      
 on a trip through a freezer.   

136
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,368
         this cooldown          

137
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,369
  avoids condensation problems  
       after packaging,         

138
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,839
    preventing mold growth.     

139
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,045
  the trip through the freezer  
 also firms up the fig cookies  

140
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,115
     so they're less likely     
  to crumble during handling.   

141
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,120
      as she packs them,        

142
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,924
   this worker examines each    
 fig cookie for imperfections,  

143
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:56,228
   and there's not one reject   
          in the lot.           

144
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,468
  the next step is packaging,   

145
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,338
   where a machine parcels up   
          the snacks.           

146
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,140
      it moves trays full       
        of fig cookies          

147
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,410
    into a sleeve of metallic   
             film.              

148
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:20,953
     finally, rotating jaws     
            heat-seal           
   the package at both ends.    

149
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:32,030
   it's taken about an hour to  
              make              
   this package of fig bars,    

150
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,566
      and it's about time       
      for a snack break.        

151
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,968
    if the crowd is hungry,     

152
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,037
       the whole package        
   could be gone in minutes,    

153
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,907
       but that's the way       
     the cookie crumbles.       

154
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,257
   narrator: thinking inside    
  the box can be a good thing   

155
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,326
    if you want to organize     
          your tools,           

156
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,196
 and of course we're referring  
        to the toolbox.         

157
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,798
      proper tool storage       
      keeps any work site       

158
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,268
        running smoothly        
       and efficiently,         

159
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,136
   and today you can really go  
               big              
        on the concept          

160
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,407
      with units designed       
 for mechanics and other pros.  

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,747
 with a professional toolbox,   

162
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:25,017
  you'll never have to rummage  
 around for the tool you need.  

163
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,285
        there's a place         
  for practically everything    

164
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,588
      in one of these mega      
         tool chests.           

165
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:35,761
     it starts with a coil      
     of heavy-duty steel.       

166
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:40,164
 it unwinds into a punch press  
    that cuts the metal into    
             panels             

167
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,135
       and punches holes        
      for later assembly.       

168
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,505
     each of these panels       

169
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,576
    will be transformed into    
       a toolbox drawer.        

170
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:56,981
   they feed the panels into    
 an automated bending machine.  

171
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,783
 it folds them on three sides   

172
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:02,054
       to create the back       
   and sides of the drawer.     

173
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,725
  it also folds over the rim.   

174
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,562
    this adds strength to the   
             drawer             
  and gives it a smooth edge.   

175
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,669
      the assembler slides      
    the front panel onto the    
            drawer,             

176
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,806
 then an automated welding gun  
     reinforces the seams       

177
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,709
        and secures part        
    of the lock mechanism.      

178
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,947
 to build the toolbox cabinet,  

179
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:34,553
  a worker arranges stiffeners  
               and              
   lock-bar grids on the back   
             wall.              

180
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:39,957
   then it's over to a lineup   
 of computerized welding guns.  

181
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,162
 these guns fuse the stiffeners 
    and grids to the panel.     

182
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,498
 each part gets numerous welds  

183
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,569
       to ensure the unit       
       really holds up.         

184
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,038
    the cabinet's side walls    
           are next.            

185
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,640
      workers prop them up      
         with supports          

186
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,644
    as they weld the panels     
       to the back wall.        

187
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,717
   with the toolbox right side  
               up,              
     they install the top.      

188
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,190
 they turn the cabinet around   

189
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,925
       and, working from        
        the open front,         

190
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,695
      slide the lock bars       
       into their slots.        

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200
        they then build         
      the front framework       

192
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,203
     and weld ledges for the    
             drawers            
     to the support grid.       

193
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,475
        they add a panel        
    to the bottom end of the    
            cabinet             

194
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,911
and weld the entire perimeter.  

195
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,950
now it's into the paint booth,  

196
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,954
      where spray guns coat     
           everything           
  in a layer of powder paint.   

197
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,757
       the paint is tough       
     and solvent-resistant      

198
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,928
    so it will hold up to oil   
             spills             
   in a garage environment.     

199
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,302
     they install the rest      
   of the locking mechanisms    

200
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,638
 on the front of the cabinet.   

201
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,710
 then, using a guide, press the 
    adhesive-backed logo into   
             place.             

202
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,914
    they now snap the drawer    
             slides             

203
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,850
           into holes           
 on the cabinet's side walls.   

204
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:15,587
   these slides are equipped    
     with roller bearings       

205
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,391
  that will enable the drawers  
  to open and close smoothly.   

206
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,129
    here they make use of the   
             holes              

207
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:29,468
    punched into the drawers    
           earlier.             

208
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,171
 a quick click, and the drawers 
  are fastened to the sides.    

209
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,011
      the drawers come in       
       a range of sizes         

210
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,281
      to accommodate tools      
   of different proportions.    

211
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,553
 the shallow compartments will  
        hold wrenches and       
         screwdrivers,          

212
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,924
   while the larger ones have   
              been              
 made for the big power tools.  

213
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,500
       workers now encase       
     this mega tool chest       

214
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,736
   in plastic and cardboard.    

215
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,707
          but this job          
   is not quite wrapped up.     

216
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,976
 they tip the unit on its side  

217
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:15,180
   and send it down the line    
        to get wheels.          

218
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,850
    the prepackaging prevents   
              dents             
 and scratches along the way.   

219
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,055
     a worker bolts casters     
 on each corner of the cabinet  

220
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,925
    to allow it to be easily    
   moved around in a garage     

221
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,461
    or any other work site.     

222
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:32,330
    add-ons can be purchased    
    for these tool chests,      

223
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,534
  so the storage possibilities  
    are virtually endless.      

224
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,735
    that's an organizational    
           approach             

225
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,405
  you can't really mess with.   

226
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,826
     narrator: natural gas      
and crude oil travel worldwide  

227
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,562
      through underground       
    and undersea pipelines.     

228
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,630
      these rugged pipes        

229
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,165
        are manufactured        
     in straight lengths,       

230
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:11,703
   but of course a pipeline's   
              route             
never runs in a straight line,  

231
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,171
         so every turn          
    or change in elevation      

232
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,075
    requires a piece of pipe    
         that's bent.           

233
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,915
    this factory specializes    
    in bending steel pipe,      

234
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:28,119
     which is manufactured      
     in straight lengths.       

235
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,323
        a piece of pipe         
   is typically 40 feet long    

236
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,191
   and weighs up to 20 tons,    

237
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,459
    so workers use a crane      

238
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,295
 to move it from one operation  
         to the next.           

239
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:44,202
  the first stop is a blasting  
 machine that cleans the pipe.  

240
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,141
  to heat and bend properly,    

241
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,810
   the surface must be clean    
         and uniform,           

242
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,347
    but pipe usually arrives    
      at the plant dirty        

243
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,550
 and wearing a coat of varnish  
      to prevent rusting        

244
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,719
 during transport and storage.  

245
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,558
  the blasting machine shoots   
     grains of steel at high    
            pressure            

246
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,828
      for about an hour.        

247
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,799
     the pipe exits with its    
             surface            
     now clean and smooth.      

248
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,638
       from the blaster,        
    it's on to the blender,     

249
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,907
 which heats the pipe to about  
   1,800 degrees fahrenheit,    

250
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,444
     then makes the bend.       

251
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:31,116
     a technician installs      
  the induction-heating coil.   

252
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,451
    induction heating allows    
 greater temperature control,   

253
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,455
   which is key to preserving   
   the quality of the steel.    

254
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,592
   the coil doesn't actually    
        touch the pipe,         

255
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,928
    because that would cause    
       a short circuit.         

256
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,732
 next they clamp a pivoting arm 
    to one end of the pipe,     

257
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,669
    then power up the coil.     

258
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:55,273
    this generates a magnetic   
              field             
  that produces intense heat.   

259
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,310
   cold-water jets confine it   
      to the target area.       

260
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,282
    as a technician monitors    
         and measures,          

261
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,750
    the arm pulls the pipe      

262
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,952
      through the hot coil      
     at a specific speed,       

263
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:12,557
   curving the softened steel   
      to the same angle.        

264
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,693
      water cools the pipe      
     at a controlled rate,      

265
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:19,497
  a process called quenching.   

266
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,433
   they must control heating    
    and cooling precisely.      

267
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,136
           otherwise,           
    the steel will weaken.      

268
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,777
     once the pipe exits the    
            bender,             

269
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,413
    workers verify the angle    
             again.             

270
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,452
        they also verify        
     the pipe's dimensions      

271
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,855
    to make sure the bending    
             process            
     didn't distort them.       

272
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,463
        now they cut off        
      the straight ends,        

273
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,732
     leaving just the curved    
            portion.            

274
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,749
     next the pipes go into     
   a furnace for tempering,     

275
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,818
      a 10-hour reheating       
      and cooling cycle.        

276
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,656
    this relieves stress in     
     the steel that bending     
            created.            

277
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,428
        after tempering,        
      pipes designed to go      
           underwater           

278
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,231
go through a second quenching.  

279
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,366
      this gives the steel      
     the right properties       

280
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,336
          to withstand          
    deep-seawater pressure.     

281
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,308
    then, using an ultrasonic   
             gauge,             

282
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,844
 workers measure the thickness  
      of the pipe walls,        

283
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,047
  which changes with bending.   

284
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,118
       after another trip       
  through the blast cleaner,    

285
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,320
     workers apply a liquid     
        that highlights         

286
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:53,457
  even the most minute surface  
     cracks that bending can    
            induce.             

287
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,294
      if they find cracks,      
     they scrap the pipe.       

288
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,734
      but defects are rare      
      because the factory       

289
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:06,137
   first performs test bends    
   on sample pieces of pipe,    

290
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:11,075
  then subjects those samples   
    to a battery of tests.      

291
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,878
  the lab measures dimensions   
      and wall thickness,       

292
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,614
   then tests how much weight   
    the sample can support      

293
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,483
       before collapsing        

294
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:23,254
 and how much stretching it can 
  withstand before snapping.    

295
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,430
  back on the factory floor,    

296
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,966
     the pipe goes through      
       another blasting.        

297
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,701
     then workers heat it       

298
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,838
   and spray on a protective    
      coating that prevents     
           corrosion.           

299
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,440
   it melds to the hot pipe.    

300
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,842
     once the pipe cools,       

301
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,112
        they stencil on         
   technical specifications.    

302
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,580
     then these pipe bends      

303
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,550
         go off to join         
 their straight counterparts.
