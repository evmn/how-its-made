00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,522
narrator: precast concrete walls      

4
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,191
are made in a controlled plant environment,           

5
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:03,129
where weather can't interfere with the curing process.     

6
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,463
they're cast with insulation   

7
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,266
before they arrive at the construction site.    

8
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,269
all that's needed is a crane to do the heavy lifting.     

9
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,143
precast concrete walls have a tough exterior      

10
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,478
that holds up to all kinds of weather,           

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,883
but making these structural wall panels is an inside job.     

12
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,018
by manufacturing them indoors,  

13
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,022
they can better prepare them for the outdoors.        

14
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:33,225
production starts with a mix of crushed rock and sand.    

15
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,495
this collection is limestone-based.       

16
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,231
the mineral mix can be altered for different strengths     

17
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,100
and finishes.          

18
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,436
a conveyor delivers the collection of minerals    

19
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,371
to a huge mixer.         

20
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,173
they inject cement, water,    

21
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,377
and additives to improve the flow of the concrete,    

22
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,246
accelerate the cure, and give it a brownish hue.   

23
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:59,285
beaters whip the ingredients into a thick, gritty mix.    

24
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,391
they cast some of the concrete into cylindrical shapes     

25
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,026
for testing.           

26
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:11,664
after a one-day cure, they crush the cylinders with a ram.              

27
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,133
the amount of force it takes to crush the cylinders            

28
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,836
is a measure of the concrete batch's strength.        

29
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,674
before they cast the wall, a crew              

30
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:26,512
arranges giant foam letters to make an imprint in the mold.              

31
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,684
they position the letters in  
the center of the casting form  

32
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,954
and secure them with silicone.  

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,095
a release agent is sprayed onto the casting form and letters.  

34
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,642
high-strength steel cables are strung throughout the form.              

35
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,377
with a hydraulic device,     

36
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,713
they pull each cable to a specific tension.      

37
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,820
then, they bend a rebar rod into a loop.           

38
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,600
the rebar loops are linked, creating long cages.       

39
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,868
they place one cage       

40
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,004
at the top of the form and one at the bottom.      

41
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,742
then, the team inserts a sheet of welded wire mesh.       

42
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:32,945
it's been cut to fit the size of the form.           

43
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,488
they're now ready to pour concrete.        

44
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,627
a truck dispenses the concrete directly into the form.     

45
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,532
the concrete flows around the steel reinforcement.         

46
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,975
the steel will keep the wall strong         

47
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,977
when the concrete expands and contracts          

48
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,279
as the weather changes.     

49
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,251
the team spreads the concrete and levels            

50
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,353
it with a tool called a screed.             

51
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,592
this first layer of the wall panel        

52
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,261
is essentially one side of a sandwich.          

53
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:26,131
it will be the exterior part of the wall.           

54
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,202
at the center of the sandwich  
is this rigid foam insulation.  

55
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:33,773
it's studded with protrusions to secure to the concrete.    

56
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:43,015
more steel-reinforced concrete completes the wall sandwich.   

57
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:47,052
this final layer will face the inside of the building...  

58
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,023
...so the crew takes extra care              

59
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,227
to ensure that there are no pits or crevices.           

60
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:07,506
after about 12 hours, the wall 
is solid enough to be handled.  

61
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,841
they take it outdoors,      

62
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,043
where a worker sandblasts a small section    

63
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,712
of the exterior side.      

64
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,716
this removes the surface cement to expose the aggregate,     

65
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:23,121
creating a decorative band next to the embossed lettering.           

66
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,790
after a three-day cure,     

67
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:28,727
the precast concrete wall is ready for the construction site.              

68
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:35,067
a crew guides it onto footings.            

69
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,537
they align its design to the one on the next wall.   

70
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,672
when the two walls match up perfectly,       

71
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,674
they bolt it down.        

72
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,611
the concrete continues to cure over time,   

73
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,083
so these precast walls will stand strong for many years.   

74
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,700
narrator: would you like to print a toy, a circuit board,  

75
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:12,238
or a replica of a famous work of art?     

76
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,907
thanks to the development of the 3d printer,        

77
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,176
what used to be the stuff of science fiction        

78
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,078
is now a reality.        

79
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,988
these objects were produced by 3d printers, proof that,   

80
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,659
for printing technology, the world is no longer flat.   

81
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,860
to make 3d printers,       

82
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:38,130
this company actually uses 3d printers.    

83
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,597
a technician starts by loading  

84
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,001
a reel of plastic filament into a printer.         

85
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,004
the printer melts the plastic into a thick goo.        

86
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,471
the 3d printer          

87
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,743
layers the plastic, following  
a pattern from a digital file.  

88
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:54,880
this particular part is the extruder body.      

89
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,484
in real time, it takes about an hour to print the extruder.   

90
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,223
even complex patterns, like this octopus,        

91
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,492
can be made with a 3d printer.  

92
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,031
40 different components of this 3d printer        

93
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,466
are produced using 3d printers.            

94
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:25,510
at this facility, 135 printers run nonstop, producing gears,  

95
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,446
brackets, and mechanism housings.     

96
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,051
this technology is truly self-replicating.    

97
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,389
now, a worker drills a hole in the extruder body.      

98
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,658
it serves as a conduit for the plastic filament     

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,327
during printing.         

100
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,335
he bolts a gear to the extruder body.      

101
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,675
he screws the motor to the extruder body       

102
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,812
and installs a second, smaller gear on the drive shaft.             

103
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,284
a part called the hot end is installed next.        

104
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,422
it contains a heater for melting the plastic filament.      

105
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:14,092
the worker attaches the hot end to a 3d-printed plastic mount  

106
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,561
and extruder.          

107
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,566
this completes the 3d printer tool head.    

108
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,371
another worker feeds glass to rubber rollers.        

109
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,841
the rollers gently apply    
adhesive-backed polyester film  

110
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,043
to the glass.          

111
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,178
the glass will serve as the printer bed,       

112
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,515
and the film will protect it from scratches during use.  

113
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,852
to build the printer's aluminum frame,  

114
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:45,858
the worker secures the joints  
with 3d-printed plastic parts.  

115
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,660
he installs two rods horizontally.          

116
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,029
they'll serve as rails for the printer tool head    

117
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,599
to move across.         

118
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,735
he clips the tool head to the rails.          

119
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,070
then, he loops a rubber belt around the motor         

120
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,540
on the side of the frame    
and links it to the tool head.  

121
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,078
the belt will drive the tool head along the carriage.     

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,879
he confirms the tension is good              

123
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:12,016
and that the tool head moves freely.          

124
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,020
next, he attaches the print bed and its sliding support     

125
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,189
structure to the base of the frame.    

126
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,032
he connects a cord to the power supply       

127
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,967
and links it to the tool head.  

128
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,670
it will power both the motor and the hot end.         

129
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,977
he clips the glass to the print bed         

130
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,380
and tightens the clips with screws.           

131
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,651
he connects the print bed to the electronics        

132
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,053
and confirms that it slides freely.      

133
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,992
in the testing department,    

134
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,862
a technician pushes the end of a plastic filament reel    

135
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,398
into a drilled channel in the tool head.        

136
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:07,472
he snaps a retainer around the feed point.      

137
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,476
now, he is ready to activate the 3d printer.   

138
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,618
he prints a test pattern to confirm that the printer bed               

139
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,855
is level and the tool head prints consistently.       

140
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,761
for two-tone printing, they use two filament reels   

141
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,498
that feed into a double extruder tool head.            

142
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:40,239
the tool head layers the plastic, one color at a time.  

143
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,774
this process takes about an hour,       

144
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,380
but that's not too long     

145
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,383
when you consider that it's printing a 3d object.             

146
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,090
talk about generating solid results.          

147
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,142
narrator: tower cranes can be found at  

148
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,678
but they're usually secured in a concrete slab        

149
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,879
that can take days to set up.  

150
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,482
if you need a crane for some quick maintenance work,              

151
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,218
a truck-mounted telescopic crane         

152
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,920
might be a better solution.   

153
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,562
telescopic cranes can support loads of up to 6 tons      

154
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:40,765
and lift objects over 30 feet in the air.           

155
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,435
the steel cable or wire rope winds        

156
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:47,506
and unwinds on a hydraulic winch.      

157
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:51,643
the crane operator can extend  
or retract the boom extensions  

158
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,446
and adjust the angle of the main boom.        

159
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,581
stowing the crane in the travel position      

160
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,584
takes just a few minutes.    

161
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,987
assembly begins when a carbon steel sheet    

162
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,790
is loaded into a cnc laser cutter.     

163
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,192
a high-energy light beam cuts through the steel plate   

164
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,463
to make several parts of the crane assembly.      

165
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,765
a computer program maximizes the number       

166
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,868
of pieces cut out of a single sheet of steel.             

167
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,108
a welder places parts on a position fixture.      

168
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,151
then, a cnc weld robot bonds the side plates         

169
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,621
to the winch mounting plate and base plate.         

170
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,295
the welded crane mast goes to the machining center.  

171
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:47,699
a machinist positions it on the horizontal mill jig.   

172
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,100
the cnc mill drills       

173
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,437
holes around the base plate with a carbide drill bit     

174
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,507
and sprays coolant to prevent the piece from overheating.   

175
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,177
then, the machine levels the surface under the base plate              

176
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,347
with an end mill to fit it to the crane mast bearing.    

177
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:11,723
another worker bends tubes with a hydraulic press brake.  

178
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,391
he makes boom segments      

179
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,529
by forming high-strength carbon steel plates into open c shapes.             

180
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,002
grounded electrostatic paint racks carry the parts      

181
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,671
into the painting department.  

182
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,412
a worker applies a coating    

183
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:36,481
of anti-rust, low-friction electrostatic paint.       

184
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,485
the paint eases the movement of the crane parts.       

185
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,422
as the boom extensions come out of the paint shop,   

186
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,658
the painted mast is ready to go to the assembly department.   

187
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:54,166
a worker positions the mast on the base bearing assembly.  

188
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,234
he attaches the mast to the bearing          

189
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,704
with high-strength steel bolts  

190
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,442
and uses a pneumatic torque wrench to tighten the bolts.   

191
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,878
these bolts bear most of the load of the crane.    

192
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,520
a worker positions the winch on the mount plate        

193
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,356
and tightens the bolts.     

194
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,526
he rotates the mast to check its movement      

195
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,862
on the base bearing.       

196
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,334
he inserts a bushing and fits it with an arbor.    

197
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,868
he applies lubricant       

198
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,539
inside the bushing before he brings in the main cylinder.   

199
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,809
the worker positions the cylinder between the side plates             

200
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,479
and pins it to the mast.     

201
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,613
the pin allows the cylinder to move vertically        

202
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,316
when elevating the boom.     

203
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,622
hydraulic actuators are now installed inside the mast.    

204
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,359
the actuators direct oil flow to the cylinders and motors,   

205
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,829
controlling the movement of the crane.          

206
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:02,900
a worker installs the boom   
extensions into the main boom.  

207
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,171
he pushes them all the way in before assembling the main boom              

208
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,440
to the crane base.        

209
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:13,778
the main boom fits right between the mast side plates.  

210
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,315
workers insert a pin to connect the mast to the main boom.    

211
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,185
they gently tap it in place with a soft mallet        

212
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,821
and bolt it on with a pneumatic wrench.   

213
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,529
a worker threads the wire rope along the boom          

214
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,667
and around the top pulley, then pulls the cable down    

215
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,070
and runs it through the snatch block.    

216
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,606
he closes a safety pin on the snatch block       

217
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,076
and pins the eye of the cable under the top pulley.      

218
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,078
another worker activates the winch motor    

219
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,215
to roll the cable in.      

220
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:54,085
the main cylinder elevates the 
crane into operating position.  

221
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,561
the extension cylinder extends the boom,        

222
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,029
and stabilizers support the back of the truck           

223
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,365
for safe operation of the crane.             

224
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,251
narrator: in a world lit by incandescent,         

225
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,654
fluorescent, halogen, and l.e.d.s,           

226
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,589
there are some people who still like their lighting  

227
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,259
the old-fashioned way.      

228
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:38,196
nothing quite matches the warm glow of a kerosene lamp.     

229
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,741
kerosene lamps date back centuries.            

230
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:55,213
they're fueled by kerosene, with a wick as the light source.             

231
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,213
to light the lamp,        

232
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,082
you remove the glass chimney,  

233
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,086
light the wick, then turn a key attached to the burner      

234
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,588
to raise or lower the wick.   

235
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,492
the height of the wick adjusts the height of the flame.             

236
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,295
this burner's components are made of brass.        

237
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,765
many of them are stamped by a press.           

238
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,835
the press rams the lubricated brass sheet against the die,   

239
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,572
forming the metal to the required shape.      

240
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:26,311
the component passes through a second stamping press,             

241
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,447
this time receiving five successive strikes.     

242
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:36,588
this component is the midsection of the burner's gallery,     

243
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,189
the ornate support fixture    

244
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,060
that holds the glass chimney over the flame.         

245
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,062
after the component passes   
through the first two presses,  

246
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,732
workers mount it on a third press.    

247
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,868
this one punches ventilation holes around the perimeter,   

248
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,139
allowing air to feed the flame.             

249
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,407
workers mount the gallery's bottom section          

250
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,677
onto another punch press.    

251
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,815
it cuts an intricate design along the perimeter.       

252
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,683
this machine cuts out the bottom             

253
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,553
so the part can fit around the burner mechanism.      

254
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,894
the next machine carves threads into it.     

255
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,230
the threads enable the gallery to screw             

256
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,566
onto the burner mechanism.    

257
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,540
now it's time to assemble the gallery sections.      

258
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,981
it has grips to hold the bottom of the chimney.         

259
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,852
next, they fasten the bottom  
section to the middle section.  

260
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,321
this method of joining parts by compressing one        

261
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,924
against the other is known as a press fit.         

262
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,795
they also stamp the brass adjustment key     

263
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,131
that raises and lowers the wick.              

264
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,733
the die stamps the manufacturer's name     

265
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,869
and cuts teeth along the perimeter,       

266
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,038
making the key easier to grip.  

267
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,809
to build the burner mechanism,  

268
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,811
they solder a notch plate, called a shutter,        

269
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,881
to a component they refer to as the candle.   

270
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,752
it's called the candle because the wick will run through it.  

271
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:16,955
they attach the adjustment key to a pair of gears...      

272
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,495
...and solder that to the shutter.       

273
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,036
they turn the key to make sure the gears rotate freely.     

274
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,307
they place a base into an assembly tool      

275
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,377
and insert the candle containing the adjustment key assembly.   

276
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,817
then, they solder on a wick guide.   

277
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:54,059
they check the gears again to make sure they rotate freely.             

278
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,463
the burner mechanism is finished.           

279
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,799
now, they dip it into a chemical degreaser    

280
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,968
to remove any lubricant or soldering residue.      

281
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,644
next, they submerge it in a vat of acids to brighten the brass.             

282
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:22,020
then, they rinse it in water three times.      

283
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,362
now, they assemble all of the burner parts.       

284
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,696
they insert a cotton wick    

285
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,099
into the guide         
at the bottom of the mechanism  

286
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,669
and turn the key to feed it up through the burner.       

287
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,576
they screw on the gallery and complete the burner     

288
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:49,847
