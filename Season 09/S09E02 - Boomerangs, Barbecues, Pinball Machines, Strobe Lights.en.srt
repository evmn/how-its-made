to hunt and that's likely how they discovered that certain

boomerangs have come a long way since then and are now finely

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,829
aircraft. construction begins with a solid piece of wo 

10
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:41,233
this tree's growth rings have been highlighted to demonstrate how comp 

11
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:45,237
become. because the wood from this section is denser than the i 

12
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:53,445
rings, it's easier to work with. a woodworker takes 16 strips of that dense wood and places   

13
00:01:53,447 --> 00:02:03,122
in a steam box for 20 minutes. the steam makes the strips much more flexibl 

14
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:07,192
in fact, they're so elastic, they can be bent by hand.

00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:30,082
watch how he arcs all 16 layers at once with little effort.

mold. they'll stay in this mold for a day or two, l 

18
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:49,702
and harden into the bent form. now it's time to laminate the  

19
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:53,371
glue is spread onto each bent strip.   then the  

20
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,709
together again back into the mold.  this time,  

21
00:02:56,711 --> 00:03:01,580
coated with wax to prevent the glue from sticking to it.    

22
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:07,653
overnight. the next day, the laminated   

23
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:14,059
it's solid but far too chunky to take flight.   a wood 

24
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,529
pieces 8 to 12 millimeters thick.              

25
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:31,143
one piece of laminated wood yields about six thinner pieces,   each of  

26
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:38,884
boomerang in its own right. but it needs more form, and   

27
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:44,023
so a more refined design is traced onto the wood and cut  

28
00:03:44,025 --> 00:04:01,173
but there's an easier way to make a boomerang -- with sturdy    aircraft 

29
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:05,644
with plywood, there's no need to laminate and then physically  

30
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:10,649
a woodworker simply cuts out the pattern...  then scu 

31
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,718
wings with a drum sander.    

32
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:25,330
he's made the tops of the wings curve upwards but in opposite  

33
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,468
it's this contouring that will make the boomerang fly in a c 

34
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,274
on some models, embedded lead weights are added for improved 

35
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:39,945
that laminated boomerang gets the same contouring but files  

36
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:45,017
sander. laminated wood responds better to this technique, but it's  

37
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:50,088
more labor intensive and requires specialized skill.   

38
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,092
size and the boomerang's aerodynamics will be thrown off kilter.      

39
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,696
but our woodworker has the job down to a fine art.       

40
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:11,643
to fine-tune the boomerang, he first softens it over a steaming kettle while twisting the w 

41
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:28,260
into an upward flip. this blower dries the wood to  

42
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:35,200
then the woodworker sets it on a flat surface to check the curve.  a sealant  

43
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:43,876
boomerang, and finally, it gets several coats of lacquer for a 

44
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:54,687
and now these boomerangs are ready to fly.    up ne

00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,155
grilling.

00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:08,366
>> narrator: the barbecue's origins are clouded in a bit of a smoky haze, but it's     

47
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:13,505
that native caribbeans were the first to cook this way.   o 

48
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:18,243
didn't have charcoal grills. they roasted meat over a smoky 

49
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:27,585
today, people still love a good cookout, but now we have better   equipment 

50
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:32,658
basic charcoal grills begin with big steel disks.   roll 

51
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,463
soapy lubricant. then they're fed into a press that shapes each one into a  

52
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:47,139
bowl. molding steel can be tricky.  

53
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:51,877
it could tear instead of bend, so workers need to make sure  

54
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,149
application of the soapy solution before it goes into the press.       

55
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:16,101
this is a back view of the press. with each p

00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,175
the barbecues' lids.       

58
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:39,657
an operator inspects each part for splits and cracks. the 

59
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:50,669
trims the rim. the scrap is tossed into a bin 

60
00:07:50,671 --> 00:08:00,279
next, the barbecue bowl spins around while an automated roller    flanges  

61
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:12,091
after that, holes are punched into the bowl for ventilation. 

62
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:16,361
welding guns. the guns fuse metal couplings to  the bowls to 

63
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:29,641
attachments for the barbecue's legs. here handles 

64
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:34,446
assembly machine. below, a turntable swings the  

65
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:38,183
then the handles are welded to each side.            

66
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:50,595
at another station, the barbecue lids get a handle of their own. no chef can  

67
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:55,134
of a burger without this essential part. this one will allow the chef  

68
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:59,471
lower the lid, to control the cooking temperature, and then lift it again when it's time  

69
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:11,483
flip the burgers. the barbecue parts now travel on  an overhead  

70
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:25,363
station. they're hosed down with soapy  

71
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:31,436
once they're dry, it's off to the finishing department. he 

72
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:37,309
a glass powder. then it's into a red-hot furnace  set to 1, 

73
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:42,381
the furnace bakes the glass dust into an enamel finish that protects the barbecue from   

74
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:45,651
and stains so they'll last for years.              

75
00:09:45,653 --> 00:10:07,873
next, they go under intense lights that expose any defects in what should be a  mir 

76
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:19,284
finish. an inspector examines each part inside and o 

77
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:23,889
a punch machine now makes dampers from aluminum.   i 

78
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:28,960
shapes and embosses the company's logo onto them.  t 

79
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:43,442
the chef to control the flow of air to the grill. nylon grips go onto the    

80
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:55,921
and the damper is installed over the lid's ventilation holes.  

81
00:10:55,923 --> 00:11:01,326
complete the final assembly, and in just a few minutes, the   

82
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,130
coming up, a high wire at a pinball factory.         

83
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:17,075
>> narrator: before video games, the pinball machine reigned   

84
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:22,014
you pull a plunger to get the ball rolling, and as your flippers send the silver sp 

85
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:27,552
flying, the machine comes to life with flashing lights and  

86
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:35,961
no wonder it's not yet game over for pinball. the game 

87
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:44,502
unprogrammed and unpredictable. it all starts with reams of wiring for the game's   e 

88
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:58,116
system. there's almost half a mile of  

89
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:06,792
the color-coded wire is wound around pins and attached to connectors on the circuit b 

90
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:11,529
technicians follow a detailed set of instructions, and an engineering diagram keeps t 

91
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:22,274
from getting in a tangle. once the wires are all laid out, they're removed in loosely   

92
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:28,614
bunches and dipped into a hot metal soup to solder them    

93
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:33,752
but not all wires are soldered. some get attachments called   

94
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:43,762
these connectors are crimped onto the ends of the wires with  a hydraulic 

95
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:49,835
eventually, the lugs will be used to connect wires to at 

96
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:55,240
but first, the cable is hooked up to a testing board where technicians check every    

97
00:12:55,242 --> 00:13:11,656
meanwhile, the play field is placed on a bed of nails and  

98
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:16,594
as the nail bed rises and presses against the header, the nails prick the back of the  

99
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:27,672
board, but the foam strips stop them from going all the way   

100
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:32,944
these nail holes will serve as markers for installing pinball targets and tactical features 

101
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:40,085
the play field. technicians drill a few holes, then cover the play fieldwi 

102
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:44,156
metal template and drill some more.   these hole 

103
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:55,633
mount the pinball gadgetry onto the play field. next, anchors are hammered   

104
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,171
place. they'll secure the metal  r 

105
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:10,115
balls from rolling off the play field.    a lamppo

107
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:26,197
now it's time to permanently attach all that wiring. some are soldered directly   

108
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:32,137
the board. others are attached to switches.  a speake 

109
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:38,076
cabinet for some major sound effects. then it's  

110
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:51,222
essential tool -- the spring-powered plunger. workers attach a toy   vi 

111
00:14:51,224 --> 00:15:01,633
and add a ramp in the shape of a sword, along with a few other  

112
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:07,372
finally, it's time for the inaugural run. the pinball is rolled into e 

113
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:12,777
target and mechanism to test the game's electronic switches.   

114
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,916
game. as technicians press all the  

115
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:33,131
diagnoses any malfunctions. they rigorously test all of the    game's fe 

116
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:44,342
if everything works, the play field is inserted into its   

117
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:49,747
a shatterproof window slides into place to protect the play 

118
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:56,754
gamers. a metal bar locks the window  

119
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:03,028
finally, the header is attached, and this pinball machine is   

120
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:16,775
coming up, little lights with lots of flash.          

121
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:27,252
>> narrator: strobe lights often conjure up images of '70s di 

122
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:32,257
but you'll also find strobe lamps -- the proper term, by the  way -- on a 

123
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,529
police lights, and on towers and tall buildings to warn  lo 

124
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:45,870
strobe lights even play a role in photography and on factory  

125
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:52,877
a strobe lamp emits repeated flashes of high-intensity light.   at this f 

126
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,749
begins with glass blowers. using a ribbon burner, they heat  glass tubes 

127
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,686
3,000 degrees. this softens the glass for   

128
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:05,824
but if it's too soft, the tubes will collapse, so the  gla 

129
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:09,361
through a rubber hose to build counterpressure.         

130
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:27,846
the size and shape of the glass tubes varies by model, but its 

131
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:34,185
house a strobe lamp's essential components -- electrodes, lead 

132
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:38,523
the electrodes conduct the current, which charges the gas 

133

illuminate. this factory makes several   

134
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:51,403
large quantities for the mass market, others in small quantities, custom-designed  

135
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:56,741
specific clients. with mass-produced models,   

136
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:03,815
after the glassblowing. custom orders are handmade from    start to  

137
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,620
workers even make the electrodes manually. they weigh 

138
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:13,224
metal powder and pour it into the cavity of a press similar to  what pharmac 

139
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:20,632
use to make pills. this powder is a blend of several different materials,

the company won't divulge the ingredients.   the pr

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,847
pellet to ensure it meets quality standards.   the 

143
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,986
hardening process called centering. they bake for nine minutes in 

144
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:45,723
hydrogen-fueled oven. hydrogen is one of the hottest 

145
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:51,930
3,000-degree heat fuses the powder particles into a solid

00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:57,068
next, workers weld a lead wire to each electrode. then they insert two  ele 

147
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,006
one for the positive current, one for the negative, into each   glass tube 

148
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:05,610
then they melt the end of the tube closed. then they attach a wire    

149
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:10,014
trigger lead. it prompts a transformer to send a high-voltage electric pulse 

150
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,684
the electrodes, illuminating the gas.

this automated machine assembles the factory's mass-produced m 

152
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:32,303
before starting it up, workers load the components -- a pair of electrodes fo 

153
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:42,246
tube on top. now the machine takes over.   

154
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:54,258
tube, injects xenon gas, melts the tube closed, then cuts off 

155
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,130
the tube's interior must be completely free of contaminants   for th 

156
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:04,602
so, just before the vacuum fill-and-seal operation, a hot coil encircles each tube to  

157
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:15,346
away any impurities. on custom-made models, all of  

158
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:20,351
with the strobe lamp complete, it's installation time.  th

lined with metallic film. a transformer regulates the

00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:39,237
its three wires connect to the positive, negative, and trigger leads protruding from the l 

162
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,908
a glass lens covers seals and protects the lamp within the reflector, and then this    

163
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:51,249
is good to go.          

164
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,250
strobe lamps are also used in  

165
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,786
stroboscopes -- industrial    

166
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,387
devices that help factories   

167
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,122
perform quality-control     

168

inspections on high-speed    

169
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,525
production lines.        

170
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,128
calibrate the light pulses to  

171
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,929
the right interval and they   

172
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,531
appear to stop the action so   

173
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,066
that cameras or workers can   

174
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,201
examine the goods.        

175
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,603
it's the size, shape, and

configuration of a strobe lamp's

and other electrical specs, that              

179
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,410
determines how long, how often,

00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:20,878
and how quickly the light

flashes.
