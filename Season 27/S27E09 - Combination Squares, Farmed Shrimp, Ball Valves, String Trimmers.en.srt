a combination square is a measuring tool you use    

5
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,456
when building with wood,    

6
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,990
masonry or metal        

7
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,659
to make sure something's straight,     

8
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,461
even and level.        

9
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,796
it's essentially a ruler    

10
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,632
with interchangeable sliding heads.         

11
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,733
the most basic head, called a square,        

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,271
measures 90 and 45 degree angles.     

13
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,808
this combination square comes with three heads.    

14
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,678
they lock into a groove on one side of the blade.   

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
the blade starts out grooved but blank.     

16
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,816
so to etch the graduations into it,    

17
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,819
they first coat the surfaces with photoresist,       

18
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,021
a chemical that hardens    

19
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:32,624
when exposed to ultraviolet light.     

20
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,093
then they flash uv       

21
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,894
light on both sides of the blade          

22
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,164
through polyester film negatives
of the graduations.      

23
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,300
the light hardens only the photo         

24
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,768
resistant hits through the clear parts.        

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,105
the rest remain soft.     

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,241
after manually masking the groove,      

27
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:53,445
workers put the blade through 
a photochemical etching machine.

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,981
it washes off the soft photoresist      

29
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,584
that's in the pattern of the graduations,      

30
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,252
then hits that bared steel   

31
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,387
with a metal-eating salt solution,         

32
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,657
etching the graduations into the blade.        

33
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,794
everything else is masked by hardened photo resist,   

34
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,664
which they wash off afterward. 

35
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,066
the blade measures in imperial units.       

36
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,668
they set it in this machine,  

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,606
which registers the location of the 1-inch mark,      

38
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,741
then grinds down the end of the blade      

39
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,811
until it's precisely 1 inch from that line.     

40
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,414
they run the blade through a sandblaster.     

41
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,284
it shoots glass beads onto the steel surface     

42
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,552
to make it microscopically rough.     

43
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,888
this will give the chrome plating a matte,        

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,157
rather than glossy finish,   

45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,228
making the graduations easier to read.        

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,429
before plating,        

47
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,466
they clean the blade by dipping it in acid.     

48
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,970
then they submerge it in the electroplating tank   

49
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,239
for about 15 seconds.     

50
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,707
now, the steel blade,     

51
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,110
with its graduations on both sides,         

52
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,845
is plated in chrome.      

53
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:06,852
the next step is called black filling.    

54
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,653
they apply black enamel paint 

55
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,321
to both sides of the blade,  

56
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,591
then wipe the surface clean.  

57
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:16,395
the black remains in the recessed graduations,  

58
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:19,598
making the numbers and lines easier to read.   

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,667
fifteen minutes in an oven to bake on the blackfill,   

60
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,003
then a quality control inspection       

61
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,473
and the blade is finished.   

62
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,609
meanwhile, in another part of the factory,        

63
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,411
this computer guided machine uses both milling   

64
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,146
and drilling tools to machine 

65
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,417
forged pieces of steel into heads.      

66
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,485
this is the forged square head,

67
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,422
before and after machining to its finished shape.     

68
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:48,026
the next step is to harden the steel.    

69
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,896
they place the head into the furnace for 3 minutes 

70
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,299
at more than 1,472 degrees fahrenheit.   

71
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,035
the head comes out covered in black soot.     

72
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,970
so they sandblast it clean.  

73
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,174
the surface is now prepped for painting.     

74
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,976
the apply powdered paint electrostatically,       

75
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,046
running a positive electrical charge to the head 

76
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,114
and a negative one to the paint.       

77
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,185
this draws the paint to the part like a magnet,   

78
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:17,522
coating the entire service in an even layer.       

79
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:22,527
a 45 minute trip through an oven bakes on the paint.  

80
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,597
then, they mount the head on a computer-guided machine  

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,932
that grinds that paint off   

82
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,668
the head's angle-measuring surfaces.   

83
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,271
they install the head's bubble level.    

84
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,674
first, they insert a white paper background,   

85
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,677
which makes it easier to see the air bubble.     

86
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,215
then they insert the glass vial containing the bubble   

87
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,885
floating in a glucose solution.

88
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,354
a dab of plaster at both ends holds the vial      

89
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,624
in its designated slot.    

90
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,025
they assemble the lock bolt  

91
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,429
that holds the head in the blade's groove.     

92
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,696
they mount it with a spring  

93
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,565
and a washer to prevent the lock

94
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,435
from rotating and secure it with a nut.   

95
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,841
then they close up the bubble level slot with an endcap.   

96
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,848
they run the unpainted angle measuring surfaces    

97
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,254
against the buffing wheel to polish the steel to a shine.

98
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,621
the last step,         

99
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,658
inserting a scribing awl into its slot.       

100
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,795
you use the awl to make a scratch mark     

101
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,531
when you take a measurement.  

102
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:37,935
now, the final assembly, the square head,        

103
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,005
the protractor head      

104
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,077
and the center head.      

105
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,613
all three come on the combination square.    

106
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:52,851
but when using the tool, you install only one at a time.

108
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,361
narrator: by the late 1960s,  

109
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,029
fishermen just couldn't keep up

110
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,498
with a growing global demand for shrimp.       

111
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,434
this gave birth to commercial shrimp farming.   

112
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,935
most shrimp farms are located 

113
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,905
near the sea for access to salt water.         

114
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,708
the greatest producer of farmed shrimp is asia,   

115
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,445
with thailand being the largest exporter.     

116
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,114
shrimp hatcheries raise the offspring         

117
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,384
of their breeding stock through three larval stages,  

118
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,186
then sell them to shrimp farms,

119
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,457
which grow them to market size.        

120
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,992
as this model demonstrates,  

121
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,596
the shrimp farm first purifies the seawater it uses,     

122
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,598
through a system of treatment ponds       

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,069
containing fish that feed on microorganisms.  

124
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,004
then the farm pumps the treated water       

125
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,472
to a culture pond,       

126
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,942
in which the juvenile shrimp grow to maturity.    

127
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:55,613
this is what the shrimp look like at about 2 months old.  

128
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,415
shrimp farms are typically located       

129
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,551
on a coast for seawater access.

130
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,420
workers spread organic fertilizer       

131
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,489
before filling the culture pond

132
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,157
to restore the soil bottom   

133
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,161
to optimum conditions between harvests.       

134
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,964
they pump seawater into the first treatment pond,   

135
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:17,101
where tilapia fish naturally purify the water by consuming 

136
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,505
floating microscopic organisms called plankton.        

137
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,640
plant matter in fish feces settle      

138
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,575
at the bottom of the pond.   

139
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,044
a pump moves water from this  

140
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,179
first treatment pond to a second one.        

141
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:33,852
for another round of this natural cleaning process.   

142
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,720
then a pump transfers the water

143
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,690
from the second treatment pond to the cultural pond.     

144
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,728
once the pond is full,     

145
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,265
they release the juvenile shrimp
purchased from the hatchery.  

146
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,535
workers regularly monitor the water's oxygen level    

147
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,203
and run aeration propellers  

148
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,739
when it drops too low.     

149
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,541
the agitation also helps    

150
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,011
debris settle at the bottom of the pond.    

151
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,481
workers run a weekly water quality test on samples    

152
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,551
drawn from the treatment and culture ponds.       

153
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,553
regularly monitoring the cultural pond       

154
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,088
is particularly critical    

155
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,959
because shrimp feces and urine break down into ammonia,    

156
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,361
which is toxic at high level. 

157
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,764
the test solution reacts to the concentration of ammonia

158
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,032
in the water sample,      

159
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,835
turning a shade of yellow or green.      

160
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,238
they consult a color chart to translate this       

161
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,708
into a milligrams of ammonia per meter reading. 

162
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,377
then they consult a table showing safe,     

163
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,647
dangerous and toxic levels.  

164
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,982
if the reading is above the safe range,     

165
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,184
they dilute the ammonia    

166
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,918
by pumping more treated water 

167
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,854
into the culture pond.     

168
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,391
once a week, they also pull a few shrimp       

169
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,127
from the culture pond to extract their livers.    

170
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,898
first, they examine the shape of the organ.    

171
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,934
they examine it under a microscope          

172
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,404
to see how fatty it is.    

173
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,274
a well-shaped liver with sufficient fat indicates 

174
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,008
the shrimp was in good health,        

175
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,978
and, therefore, the others back
in the pond are too.      

176
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,219
the growing shrimp are fed an all-natural diet,      

177
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,688
which includes probiotics,   

178
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,690
tamarind,           

179
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,226
which is soaked in water...  

180
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,232
and garlic.          

181
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,101
workers add these three ingredients to the shrimp feed,

182
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,371
which is a mixture of fish meal, fish oil,    

183
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,941
soy bean pulp and rice flour. 

184
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,511
tamarind maintains the right level of acidity   

185
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,782
in the shrimp's gut.      

186
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,952
garlic prevents bacteria buildup in the colon.     

187
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,658
and the probiotic solution provides beneficial bacteria, 

188
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,793
which prevents infections and improves          

189
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,730
how the shrimp digests nutrients.       

190
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,002
after blending and liquefying the three ingredients,     

191
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,204
they mix in 6 fluid ounces per        

192
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,239
2 pounds of shrimp feed.    

193
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:17,148
four times a day, at 8 am, noon,         

194
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,218
4 pm and 8 pm, workers pour food       

195
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,286
onto an automatic feeding machine,        

196
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,890
which distributes it evenly throughout the culture pond.  

197
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,432
the shrimp feed over the entire 12 hour period,   

198
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,034
eating the equivalent of about 4%          

199
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,103
to 5% of their body weight.  

200
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,179
after 4 to 5 months in the cultural pond,     

201
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,982
the shrimp mature to market size,        

202
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,386
which is 20 to 30 grams.    

203
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,721
once they're harvested,    

204
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,789
the farm drains the culture pond        

205
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,826
and starts the process all over again.        

206
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,770
♪♪         

207
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,874
the ball valve came into large scale industrial use   

208
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,210
during the 20th century.    

209
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,812
with a hollow and pivoting ball

210
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,880
to control the flow of fluids, 

211
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,684
this valve is durable and resistant to contamination.

212
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,353
it's why many industries rely on ball valves      

213
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,322
to keep production flowing.  

214
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,361
ball valves control the flow of gases.       

215
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,964
in machinery used to produce high-tech products       

216
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,899
like led lights.        

217
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,701
it's just one way they contribute        

218
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,171
to the modern world.      

219
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,906
making ball valves for led   

220
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,240
manufacturing starts      

221
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,177
with an 11-foot long steel bar stock.     

222
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,382
as coolant, a saw carves it up like salami,       

223
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,786
producing 50 or 60 steel pucks.

224
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,989
computerized tooling then drills holes in the pucks,

225
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,392
as it begins to transform them into the valve center parts.  

226
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:13,832
the system changes tool bits automatically.    

227
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,666
cutters square up the pucks,  

228
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,837
so that they'll fit in the led chip making machinery.     

229
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,208
a grinding tool mills the tops of the parts     

230
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,277
to a precise tolerance.    

231
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,349
once the final shape has been achieved,       

232
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,152
a worker gives the part a sanding.      

233
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,888
he removes rough bits, known as burrs,        

234
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,758
and smoothes the entire surface.

235
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,227
with a narrow blade,      

236
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,895
he then scrapes off any burrs in the holes     

237
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,765
that could impede the valve's function.     

238
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,500
with the deburring complete,  

239
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,237
he measures each valve body.  

240
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,506
ceramic bits that look like aquarium gravel      

241
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,777
will now be used to polish the steel valve parts.     

242
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,979
the operator places the valve bodies        

243
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,849
in the cells of a drum tumbler.

244
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,852
he puts the lid on the tumbler and sets it in motion.     

245
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,188
the friction polishes the steel,

246
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,724
creating a smooth surface   

247
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,760
that won't block the movement of gas molecules.       

248
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,700
next, they assemble flanges to the endcaps.        

249
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,203
after tack welding the two parts together,    

250
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,807
an operator places them in a revolving fixture.    

251
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,541
he welds them together,    

252
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,810
creating a substantial inside seam          

253
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,815
that will hold up to vacuum conditions.     

254
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,217
he scrubs off the heat stain inside the part,        

255
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,285
using a wire brush.      

256
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,888
the stain has also spread around the seams        

257
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,489
on the outside of the parts.  

258
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,762
so a worker rinses the outside of the seam with water.    

259
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,564
he washes off the stain    

260
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,032
using an electrified carbon brush          

261
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,402
and an acid cleaning solution. 

262
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,507
then it's in to an ultrasonic cleaner,     

263
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,576
where soundwaves ripple through water      

264
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,981
to remove dust and cleaning solution residue. 

265
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,249
to assemble the ball valve,  

266
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,650
the technician places     

267
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,453
two rubber o-rings on top of an endcap.      

268
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,992
next is a thick synthetic ring,

269
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,061
which will secure the ball in the valve.     

270
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,631
he seats the valve body over it.

271
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,137
he cleanses the hollow steel ball     

272
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,340
and inserts it in the valve body.       

273
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,078
he stacks more rubber sealers, 

274
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,550
another synthetic sealer and another endcap on top.   

275
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,218
he inserts long bolts into the four corners     

276
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,620
of the valve          

277
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,624
and secures them tightly with nuts to keep air     

278
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,692
from seeping into the valve.  

279
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,764
he attaches a handle to the stem,          

280
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,567
protruding from the valve body.

281
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,571
he installs a stop pin to prevent the handle     

282
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:10,774
from opening beyond a quarter turn.        

283
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,444
finally, he tightens the nut that locks the handle     

284
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,914
to the valve stem.       

285
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,184
he now secures the ball valve in a vise           

286
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:24,055
to hold it steady while he tests its function.  

287
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,190
when the whole of the ball is aligned with flanges    

288
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,726
of the endcaps, the valve is open.       

289
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,263
and when it's perpendicular to it, it's shut.       

290
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,532
satisfied with its function,  

291
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:38,336
he transfers the ball valve to the laser engraver.     

292
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,738
the laser etches the serial number       

293
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,341
and other information onto the valve body.      

294
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,346
and now, one final test,    

295
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,114
the technician connects the valve           

296
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,816
to a vacuum pumping system   

297
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,286
and activates a leak-detecting device.    

298
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,155
while the pump draws a vacuum, 

299
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,957
he sprays helium gas onto the valve         

300
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,226
to detect any leaks.      

301
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,229
this ensures the valve will operate properly     

302
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,698
in a high vacuum environment. 

303
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,567
some of these ball valves are manually operated.     

304
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,304
and others are computerized.  

305
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,105
both versions are designed to hold up      

306
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,176
to high vacuum conditions and handle the flow.

00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,987
narrator: if you have grass or weeds to cut,        

309
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,989
but can't access the spot with your lawn mower,     

310
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,792
you need a string trimmer for the job.      

311
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,995
it's compact, letting you cut around     

312
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,663
and in between objects,    

313
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,665
and doesn't ride on the ground.         

314
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,534
so you can easily use it on a steep terrain.      

315
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,808
a string trimmer slices the vegetation in its path   

316
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,744
with a rotating nylon line.  

317
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,546
the motor that turns the spool of line       

318
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,182
is protected by a two-part housing made of polymer.    

319
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,287
the polymer pellets are pumped through pipes to the hopper,  

320
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,222
that feeds an injection molding machine.        

321
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,558
the machine melts them,    

322
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,295
then shoots the liquid plastic into housing-shaped molds.   

323
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:15,900
the machine then cools the molds
to solidify the plastic    

324
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,969
and ejects the molded parts,  

325
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:23,508
which a robot grabs and places in a collection box.      

326
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,310
to make other plastic parts of the string trimmer,     

327
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,847
they install different molds  
on the injection molding machine

328
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,181
and hook up the feed line   

329
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,519
for whichever color pellets they're using.         

330
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,053
to make the cutting line,   

331
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,790
an extrusion machine melts down plastic pellets,     

332
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,592
then forces the liquid plastic through        

333
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,196
a round die to form line.   

334
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,332
a cold water bath cools and solidifies the shape.   

335
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,069
then, heated rollers stretch the line        

336
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,805
until its reduced to 3 millimeters in diameter. 

337
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,209
the line is wound onto large spools,       

338
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,477
which feed the machines    

339
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,480
that wind the finished trimmer spools.        

340
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,882
on the engine assembly line,  

341
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,017
an automated machine applies sealant        

342
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,254
to the magnesium engine pan.  

343
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
they place the cylinder    

344
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,761
on an assembly fixture,    

345
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,165
apply a gasket, then insert the piston.    

346
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,034
already assembled to the crankcase,       

347
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,235
its up and down motion turns. 

348
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,372
then they mate the engine pan to the crankcase.       

349
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:33,711
the sealant in between     
making that connection airtight.

350
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,713
an automated machine screws the components together,    

351
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,982
then closes off the exhaust ports       

352
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,719
and pulls a vacuum to test the seal.       

353
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,189
if the engine assembly passes the test,        

354
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,658
it continues down the assembly line.       

355
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,994
they install a gasket...    

356
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,532
the carburetor...       

357
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,668
another gasket         

358
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,004
and the housing for the air filter.      

359
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,274
then they install a baffle,  

360
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,875
which distributes air     

361
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,344
so that it enters the air filter evenly.     

362
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:12,216
they attach a gasket under the muffler       

363
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,351
and screw the muffler onto the cylinder.       

364
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:18,222
the gasket and sealant on the screws ensure      

365
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,693
the only exhaust gases can escape through the muffler.

366
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,628
next, the flywheel.      

367
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,632
when it rotates, magnets inside produce     

368
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,301
an electromagnetic field the ignition uses       

369
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,835
to set off the spark plug   

370
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,506
that starts the engine combustion cycle.       

371
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,574
after mounting the clutch on the flywheel,        

372
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,112
they install the spark plug on the cylinder.     

373
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,246
this automated machine     

374
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,448
simultaneously tightens the spark plug,        

375
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,853
the clutch and the flywheel to specified torques.     

376
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,856
by this point, workers have welded      

377
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,991
a fuel tank to the motor housing.     

378
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,460
they've also installed a trigger,           

379
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,329
a trigger release, and a stop switch.       

380
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,667
they place the assembled engine into the housing.    

381
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,205
they also place the air filter into the filter housing.    

382
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,942
at the next station,      

383
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,779
they attach the other half of the motor housing.   

384
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,353
a robot tightens the screws to a specific torque.     

385
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,826
next, they screw a cover on to the filter housing.   

386
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,032
then they create the trimmer's powerhead    

387
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:38,235
by installing the starter cover.       

388
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,138
it contains the cord you pull to start the engine.   

389
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,842
elsewhere in the factory,   

390
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,677
they build the shaft assembly, 

391
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,647
to which they'll later attach the powerhead.     

392
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,516
first, they put together the handle in the gearhead   

393
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,186
that turns the spool of line. 

394
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,121
then they install the spool.  

395
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,656
when the cutting line wears down from use,         

396
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,525
you tap the spool against the ground       

397
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:05,396
to automatically advance more line.           

398
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,399
they insert the shaft assembly into the powerhead.  

399
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,535
the other end of the drive shaft connects to the gearhead.

400
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:17,274
the last step is to attach the gearhead's deflector,   

401
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,009
which is designed to help prevent        

402
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,613
what you're trimming from flying up at you.     

403
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,215
to use the string trimmer,   

404
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,284
you fill the fuel tank with a gas and oil mixture.  

405
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,222
then, just pull the cord to start her up.
