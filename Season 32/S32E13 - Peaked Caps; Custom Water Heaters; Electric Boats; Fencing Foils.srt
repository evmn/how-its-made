         the welding arm        

125
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,211
       through a u.v. lens      
      to protect his eyes.      

126
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,347
 the machine stops automatically

127
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,284
         when it reaches        
   the programmed seam length.  

128
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,420
this process closes the cylinder

129
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,756
         with a strong,         
    pressure-resistant seam,    

130
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:15,094
    creating the water-heater   
  tank's structural component.  

131
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,563
    another technician places   
   the tank's top on a press.   

132
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,633
    the press punches a hole    
  for a threaded pipe fitting.  

133
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,302
  the fitting connects the pipe 
        to the hot water.       

134
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,970
    using a different press,    

135
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,639
      the technician makes      
          another hole          

136
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,042
        into the cylinder       
     for a threaded fitting.    

137
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,244
    this fitting connects to    
      an electrical element     

138
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,781
        that heats water        
  in conjunction with a boiler. 

139
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,516
    another technician makes    
     the tank's heating coil    

140
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,454
  by running a straight copper  
   tube through three rollers.  

141
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,656
the tube is bent under pressure,

142
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,859
 forming it into a coiled shape.

143
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,863
    the heat from the boiler,   
      pump, or solar panel      

144
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,698
 flows through the heating coil,

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,833
    heating the water stored    
          in the tank.          

146
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,741
   since the copper-tube wall   
      is too thin to weld,      

147
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:06,879
   a technician uses a fusing   
   technique known as brazing.  

148
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,948
   this metal-joining process   
      brazes a flow fitting     

149
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,616
 on one end of the heating coil 

150
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,752
      and a return fitting      
          on the other.         

151
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:20,291
     next, the heating coil     
     is placed in the tank.     

152
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,096
  the fittings protrude through 
  a hole at the top and bottom. 

153
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:26,831
 the technician secures each one
           with a nut,          

154
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,568
     then tightens the nuts     
     with an impact wrench.     

155
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,574
  like the dome top, the bottom 
 component's edges are grooved, 

156
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,509
        allowing the tank       
        to fit perfectly        

157
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,311
     into the cylinder base.    

158
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,650
     once the top and bottom    
    components are installed,   

159
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,785
       the tank goes back       
     to the brazing station     

160
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,455
       for final assembly.      

161
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,993
         a welder brazes

162
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,395
        to the cylinder,        

163
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:58,797
         then he brazes         
    a feed fitting to a hole    

164
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,598
  near the bottom of the tank.  

165
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,068

     a quality-control test.    

168
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:16,148
  he blocks the three fittings, 
  fills the cylinder with air,  

169
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,551
then submerges the tank in water
    to check for air bubbles,   

170
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,353
  which would indicate a leak.

   holes have been pre-drilled  
        to avoid cracking       

247
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,399
 when installation is complete. 

248
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,837
    this manufacturer sources   
          their motors          

249
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,039
         from an outside        
     electric-motor company,    

250
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,444
    which also builds motors    
            for cars.           

251
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:16,448
    the fin, made of aluminum   
 encased in marine-grade rubber,

252
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,585
   is installed on the bottom   
          of the motor.         

253
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,822
     the propeller attaches     
  to the motor with a zinc nut. 

254
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,527
   two circuit boards located   
            on board            

255
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,062
     will send instructions     
          to the motor.         

256
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,199
  a waterproof cover is placed  
  on top of the circuit boards  

257
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,067
      for added protection.     

258
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,271
locknuts with nylon washers will
 prevent unnecessary vibrations 

259
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,207
     while the motor is on.     

260
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,008
    with the steering cables    
           installed,           

261
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,478
     the entire unit pivots     
         right and left,        

262
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,414
       allowing the pilot       
        on deck to steer.       

263
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,149
the powerful motor is equivalent

264
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,085
       to a 10-horsepower       
       combustion engine,       

265
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,954
       and because it sits      
          in the water,         

266
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,289
    it stays cool and quiet.    

267
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,560
  finally, a craftswoman places 
      the boat's sun canopy     

268
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,828
       over the framework.      

269
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,430
    this will allow customers   
       to add solar panels      

270
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,098
     for charging the boat.     

271
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,501
   also, a customer can choose  
           the colors           

272
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,303
     for both their canopies    
         and upholstery.        

273
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,372
       there's no denying       
       that electric boats      

274
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,608
      are the future of fun     
          on the water.         

275
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:29,253
                     ♪          

276
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,788
            narrator:           
    modern fencing is a sport   

277
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,993
consisting of three disciplines,
  one of which is foil fencing. 

278
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,462
         while in play,         
    a lightweight foil sword    

279
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,664
    is used to score points.    

280
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,400
      points can be scored      
when the tip of a player's sword

281
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:47,138
       makes contact onto       
     their opponent's torso.    

282
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,407
        a fencing foil is       
      a piece of equipment      

283
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,410
    that should only be used    
    by trained professionals.   

284
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,747
     this sword doesn't have    
  a sharp edge or pointed tip.  

285
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,617
  it's all about scoring hits.  

286
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:02,887
     fencing foils are made     
     out of thin steel bars.    

287
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,824
   the steel is a low-carbon,   
        nickel-rich alloy       

288
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,359
   that's strong yet flexible.  

289
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:13,164
 an automated saw cuts the bars 
    to a length of 35 inches.   

290
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:19,104
  the bar will be stretched and 
 shortened as it's transformed. 

291
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,907
    a forge heats and hammers   
 the hilt end to a round shape, 

292
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,510
   leaving the rest of the rod  
          rectangular.          

293
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,181
 here you can see the difference
       in the rod's shape.      

294
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,518
     another forging machine    
   softens the end of the rod   

295
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,888
      and pushes the blade      
  through a series of hammers.  

296
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,724
      this tapers the blade     
    and stretches the steel,    

297
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,626
      doubling it in size.      

298
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,398
       an operator clamps       
   the tapered blade in a jig   

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,335
       to hold it straight      
     while the steel cools.     

300
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:57,275
    then the operator slices    
     the hilt end to length.    

301
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:02,414
    the excess steel will be    
    recycled into new swords.   

302
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:06,851
   next, the blades are heated  
      in a 932-degree oven.     

303
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,553
   this step removes stresses   

304
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,522
       and makes the metal      
          less brittle.         

305
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,826
     after a second heating,    

306
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:17,796
     the blades soak in oil     
       to cool and harden.      

307
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,901
  the exposure to intense heat  
      causes a rusty scale      

308
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:27,371
      to form on the blade,     
  so technicians clean it off.  

309
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:31,042
 a sword maker clamps the blades
       in a disc grinder.       

310
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:35,313
the grinder carves a fine groove
    from the hilt to the tip.   

311
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:39,984
  the groove will house a wire  
for the electric scoring system.

312
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,453
 the blade is cleaned to remove 

313
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,055
          any remaining         
     surface imperfections.     

314
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,658
         a spinning belt        
     coated with an abrasive    

315
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,461
      grinds all four sides     
          of the blade.         

316
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,263
   then the sword is polished   

317
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,100
      using a buffing wheel     
     and polishing compound.    

318
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,640
 you can see the difference this
makes in the blade on the right.

319
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,278
 the craftsman hammers the blade
        against an anvil        

320
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,482
  to straighten out any kinks.  

321
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,517
   then he inspects the blade.  

322
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,988
  if needed, the craftsman will 
        make adjustments        

323
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,358
   to the blade with a hammer.  

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,494
      now it's time to work     
  on the hilt end of the blade. 

325
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,298
 another craftsman locks the end
of the blade in a threading die,

326
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,767
       applies lubricant,       

327
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,836
          and activates         
      the automated system.     

328
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,573
   the system turns the sword   
in the die, carving out threads.

329
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,009
     then the threaded hilt     
        is cut to length.       

330
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,649
      at the next station,      
  a computerized laser engraves 

331
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,519
the company logo into the steel.

332
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,488
     after the sensor barrel    
          is installed          

333
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,989
     on the end of the sword    

334
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,193
 and the electrical scoring wire
    is placed in the groove,    

335
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,597
   the technician applies glue  
    to keep the wire secure.    

336
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,532
    the sword blade is placed   
            in a rack           

337
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,602
          that holds it         
       in a bow-like bend.      

338
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,337
       this step will give      
         the glued wire         

339
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,006
    the flexibility it needs    

340
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:11,342
      to bend with the rest     
   of the sword while in use.   

341
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,546
   after the blade has cured,   
    a pressure sensor spring    

342
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,383
   is inserted into the barrel  
and capped with a sensor button.

343
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:24,222
   the technician uses screws   
to hold the components together.

344
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,892
      to assemble the hilt,     

345
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,096
  the scoring wire is threaded  
   through a hole in the guard  

346
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:34,833
     so it can easily slide     
           into place.          

347
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,869
      then the sensor wire      
    is connected to a socket.   

348
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,574
 the wiring assembly is covered 
       with a plastic pad       

349
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,877
     that allows the socket     
          to protrude.          

350
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,315
 finally, the pistol-grip handle

351
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:54,752
         is screwed into        
 the threaded end of the blade. 

352
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,323
 this fencing foil is now ready 
          for testing.          

353
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,061
the technician plugs the fencing
  foil into testing equipment,  

354
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:06,063
   then he places a one-pound   
   weight on the sensor button  

355
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:09,934
        and checks to see       
         if it responds.        

356
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,669
     and the results are in.    

357
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:15,907
 this fencing foil is now ready 
 to stand up to its competition.
