1
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,786
            narrator:           
      a pair of binoculars      

2
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,388
    is essentially a handheld   
        double telescope.       

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,724
   light rays from the object   
         you're viewing         

4
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,493
enter the lenses on the far end,
         the objectives.        

5
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,129
     this projects an image     
    just behind those lenses    

6
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,798
 inside the binoculars' housing.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,266
   the smaller eyepiece lenses  
        you peer through        

8
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,369
    then magnify that image.    

9
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,607
   the objectives are curved,   

10
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,677
   causing the image to appear  
          upside down.          

11
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,545
   the turn it right side up,   

12
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,148
      each binocular half       
      needs a glass prism.      

13
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,817
using u.v.-light-activated glue,

14
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,820
  workers mount several prisms  
         on steel plates        

15
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,825
that take them through a series 
of grinding and polishing steps.

16
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,095
        protective paint        
        prevents any dust       

17
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,865
       from contaminating       
      the pristine surface.     

18
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,633
   grinding with diamond dust   

19
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,636
       removes mere tenths      
    of a millimeter of glass.   

20
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,772
            polishing           
   with an even finer abrasive  

21
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,908
      removes another 1/100     
        of a millimeter.        

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,845
 at the end of it all, the three
    sides are perfectly flat.   

23
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,647
   this minimizes reflection,   

24
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,650
  critical for making the glass 
          see-through.          

25
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,385
       to make each prism,      

26
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:04,723
  they glue two pieces of glass 
     together at 90 degrees.    

27
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,026
  this special machine ensures  
      the angle is precise.     

28
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,001
      a shot of u.v. light      
         dries the glue.        

29
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:20,405
the first piece of glass rotates
 the inverted image 90 degrees. 

30
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:25,143
  the second rotates it another 
90 degrees, completing the flip.

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,478
     now for the objectives.    

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,548
    these curved lenses have    
   undergone the same grinding  

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,683
       and polishing steps      
         as the prisms.         

34
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,885
now they go through a nine-stage

35
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,288
         computer-guided        
        cleaning process.       

36
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,425
  after inspecting the lenses,  
a technician glues two together.

37
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,361
   a double lens limits a type  
          of distortion         

38
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:48,367
  that causes fringes of color  
  to appear around the image.   

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,107
   it's critical to match them  
    to each other perfectly.    

40
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,642
     if the alignment's off     

41
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,910
    by more than just 1/100th   
        of a millimeter,        

42
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,979
     the image will be poor.    

43
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,115
     this alignment machine     
         displays a dot         

44
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,518
     representing the center    
          of each lens,         

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,121
      so it's just a matter     
      of matching the dots.     

46
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,924
  a 2-second shot of u.v. light 
         dries the glue.        

47
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,995
next, a technician loads mineral
 pellets into a vacuum chamber. 

48
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,932
     their exact formulation    
      is a company secret.      

49
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:23,068
       the pellets produce      
 an anti-reflection lens coating

50
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,803
      that lets more light      
    come through the lenses.    

51
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,606
   inside the vacuum chamber,   

52
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,609
       a beam of electrons      
     evaporates the pellets     

53
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,046
   into microscopic particles   
      that coat the lenses.     

54
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,286
  it's time to begin assembling 
         the binoculars.        

55
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,155
      first, the objectives     
      go into the housing,      

56
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,693
    which is usually made of    
  plastic, aluminum, or carbon. 

57
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,695
    workers clean the lenses    

58
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,732
        with a few blasts       
    of compressed nitrogen...   

59
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:00,172
  ...then secure them in place  
  with threaded holding rings.  

60
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,881
     now a few drops of glue    
     behind the objectives,     

61
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,050
    where the prisms will go,   

62
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,920
    another blast of nitrogen   
       to remove any dust,      

63
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,922
  then they insert the prisms.  

64
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,992
   this optical machine aligns  
  the focal points of the prism 

65
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,261
and its corresponding objective.

66
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,733
      then, some more glue      
   to lock in the positioning   

67
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:32,137
    and a blast of u.v. light   
        to dry the glue.        

68
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,940
now they silicone the objectives
           and prisms           

69
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,008
to the housing's middle section.

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,610
  silicone creates an airtight  
      and waterproof seal.      

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:44,148
     this holding mechanism     
   presses the parts together   

72
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,152
          while workers         
      drive in the screws.      

73
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:51,222
  onto the opposite end of the  
 middle section go the oculars, 

74
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,825
       the smaller lenses       
     through which you look.    

75
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,494
        those also attach       
  with threaded holding rings.  

76
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,696
      now, through a valve      
          on each side,         

77
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,965
       a machine sucks air      
        from the housing        

78
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,834
    and injects nitrogen gas.   

79
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,171
  nitrogen prevents the lenses  
        from fogging up.        

80
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,572
      a day after filling,      

81
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,975
          they recheck          
      the nitrogen pressure     

82
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,577
  to make sure there's no leak. 

83
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,380
      this factory puts all     
   the binoculars it produces   

84
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,315
    through rigorous testing,   

85
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,251
         subjecting them        
     to prolonged vibration,    

86
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,254
  water pressure, extreme heat, 

87
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,459
     freezing temperatures,     
  and other trying conditions.  

88
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,263
        after every test,       

89
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:35,133
 inspectors make sure everything
     still works perfectly,     

90
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,136
both mechanically and optically.

91
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,820
narrator: sparklers have sizzled
on the party scene for decades, 

92
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,955
  adding pyrotechnical glitter  
           to weddings          

93
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,223
   and birthday celebrations.   

94
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,558
     they evolved from more     
     traditional fireworks      

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,562
 and are the only kind that the 
 consumer can handle when lit.  

96
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,166
  lighting one definitely means 
    excitement is in the air.   

97
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,907
  the splash of flash can last  
        a minute or more,       

98
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,509
     depending on the length    
        of the sparkler.        

99
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,647
   they start with steel wires  
 that are about 19 inches long. 

100
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,717
    they load bundles of them   
into slots of a sorting machine.

101
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,258
      the machine vibrates,     

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,129
  and the wires fall in single  
  file into smaller openings.   

103
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,399
     the operator then moves    
   a spring-loaded wooden rack  

104
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,403
         into position.         

105
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,672
    it opens like the bellows   
        of an accordion.        

106
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,943
       the operator rocks       
  the sorting machine overhead, 

107
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,812
       and the wires drop       
   into the slits of the rack,  

108
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,815
       perfectly aligned.       

109
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,093
    after 300 sparkler wires    
   have fallen into position,   

110
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,830
   the operator pulls a handle  
       to close the rack.       

111
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,302
         now, clamped in        
    the accordion-style rack,   

112
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,739
 the wires are ready to move on 
      to the next station.      

113
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,511
   wires for parade sparklers   
       are much longer --       

114
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,447
      36 inches, in fact --     

115
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,982
   which means they're heavier  
    than ordinary sparklers.    

116
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,519
the operator loads each of these
   wires manually into a rack   

117
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,322
   that's larger and sturdier   
       than the last one.       

118
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,258
     this system of loading     
  is a lot more time-consuming, 

119
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,994
 but parade sparklers are worth 
        the extra trouble       

120
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,196
      because they'll have      
      a longer burn time --     

121
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,631
       up to four minutes.      

122
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:58,143
     next, an operator loads    
  boric acid and barium nitrate 

123
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,744
     into a big mixing tank.    

124
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,615
       the barium nitrate       
         is an oxidizer         

125
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,150
and will help the sparkler burn.

126
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,485
the boric acid is a neutralizer.

127
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,756
          he adds water         
    and mixes in cornstarch.    

128
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,860
          it will bind          
  all the ingredients together. 

129
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,167
        next, he pours in       
  some very fine iron filings.  

130
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,037
  these bits of iron will give  
 the sparklers their gold color.

131
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,643
   the operator then suits up   
       in protective gear       

132
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,179
      and closes the door.      

133
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,981
he's the only one allowed inside
     to load the sparklers'     

134
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,384
   most volatile ingredient --  
        aluminum powder.        

135
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,587
 once mixed into the wet slurry,

136
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,722
           the powder           
     is virtually harmless,     

137
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,994
   and they don't need to take  
   as many safety precautions.  

138
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,930
    chain conveyors now move    
   the rack of sparkler wires   

139
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,298
         into position.         

140
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,401
   an elevator lifts up a tank  
     of the sparkler slurry     

141
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,936
     to dip the wires in it.    

142
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,677
     the next rack of wires     
 then moves forward for dipping.

143
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,417
     286 racks of wires move    
  through this dipping station  

144
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,986
   every hour and 45 minutes.   

145
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,228
they go through a second dipping
  station for one more coating. 

146
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,841
     the two coatings double    
   the diameter of the wires.   

147
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,643
         after each dip,        

148
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,579
   wires ride an overhead rail  
         through an oven        

149
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,549
   to bake the sparkler slurry  
        until it's hard.        

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,187
   an inspector then examines   
         each sparkler.         

151
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,522
      she checks for cracks     
          and defects.          

152
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,191
     any wire that's flawed     
        will be rejected        

153
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,796
  because these sparklers have  
  to outshine the competition.  

154
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,536
it takes her about three minutes

155
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,607
  to examine the 300 sparklers  
           on a rack.           

156
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,145
     they check the diameter    
        of each sparkler        

157
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,214
          by sliding it         
       through a template,      

158
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,750
        and they bend it        
     to check its integrity.    

159
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,492
 the sparklers have been stored 
 for a week prior to packaging  

160
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,028
     to allow them to cure.     

161
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,099
      and now they're ready     
          for a party,          

162
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,536
     and they're sure to be     
    the center of attention.    

163
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,115
   narrator: wellington boots,  
     billy boots, galoshes.     

164
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,250
          by any name,          

165
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,586
        rubber rain boots       
       owe their existence      

166
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,121
   to a 19th-century american,  
        charles goodyear.       

167
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,390
           he invented          
   the vulcanization process,   

168
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,193
 a way of keeping natural rubber
       from deteriorating.      

169
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,663
  nowadays, rain boots are made 
    from a synthetic material   

170
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,599
  called thermoplastic rubber,  
             or tpr.            

171
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,938
      they're functional --     
        even fashionable.       

172
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,542
   making rubber boots begins   
  with spools of polyester yarn 

173
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,976
        for their lining.       

174
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,612
      a colored spool adds      
      a thin line of color      

175
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,149
    to indicate the foot size   
         of the lining.         

176
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,016
  a computer-programmed machine 

177
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,820
        crochets the yarn       
        with 242 needles.       

178
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:32,690
  as we can see in slow motion, 
   each gate opens completely,  

179
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,959
    then closes on the yarn.    

180
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,430
       the needles rotate       
      750 times per second.     

181
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,297
  they can program the machine  

182
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,234
         to make linings        
      for any size of boot.     

183
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,841
      for quality control,      

184
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,344
workers spot-check a few linings
        from every batch.       

185
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,588
      now the action moves      

186
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,925
        to this automated       
    injection-molding machine   

187
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:07,925
       with six stations.       

188
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,928
        each one produces       
        a pair of boots.        

189
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,531
  workers carefully roll a pair 
           of linings           

190
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,334
 onto each station's foot form, 
        called the last.        

191
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,270
     these lasts will create    
    the space inside the boot   

192
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,206
   for the lower leg and foot.  

193
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,678
      a five-part boot mold     
  closes around the foot last.  

194
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,281
      then, a high-pressure     
         injection screw        

195
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,283
        pushes in melted        
        synthetic rubber,       

196
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,319
       first in the soles,      
     then in the upper boot.    

197
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,225
         the company lab        
     regularly tests samples    

198
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,160
 of the synthetic rubber pellets

199
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,828
 that feed the injection machine

200
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,964
     to make sure they melt     
         and flow well.         

201
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:49,967
   the lab technician pours in  
    some pellets, melts them,   

202
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,371
     then pushes in a piston    
  to extrude the molten rubber. 

203
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,208
   the machine measures what's  
   called the melt flow index.  

204
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,713
   back on the factory floor,   

205
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,649
      a large suction hose      
      feeds rubber pellets      

206
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,184
       to the injectors --      

207
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,887
    black for the boot body,    
       red for the soles.       

208
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,261
      and at this factory,      
     nothing goes to waste.     

209
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,329
  it recycles rubber leftovers  

210
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:22,066
    or rejects of all colors    
  into a batch of black rubber. 

211
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,270
      the suction hose then     
 sends the pellets into a hopper

212
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,873
     which feeds the barrel     
     of the injection unit.     

213
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,409
        the heater bands        
       inside the barrels       

214
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,478
        melt the pellets        
     at 200 degrees celsius.    

215
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,015
   then, at the precise moment  
        the mold arrives,       

216
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,949
       the injector shoots      
      in the molten rubber.     

217
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,287
   giant clamps apply pressure  
      for about 10 seconds,     

218
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,890
          then release.         

219
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,626
      a hydraulic cylinder      
      pushes up the last,       

220
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,427
  helping to extract the boots. 

221
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,966
  then it's quickly on with new 
   linings for the next pair.   

222
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:03,508
       total molding time?      
        just 30 seconds.        

223
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:12,116
 the boots cool for 45 minutes, 
 then head off to packaging...  

224
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,785
      making just one stop      
          along the way         

225
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,256
   at the pad printing machine  
   to get the company's logo.   

226
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,991
    elsewhere in the factory,   

227
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,326
          a seamstress          
      carefully constructs      

228
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,995
    a patterned boot lining.    

229
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,798
   the factory crochets white   
  linings in a continuous roll, 

230
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,136
    then has another company    
      print on the design.      

231
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,606
       the trickiest part       
       is shaping the toe       

232
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:39,477
because she has to curve and cut
 the material at the same time. 

233
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,212
   for these patterned boots,   

234
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,681
       the machine injects      
 a transparent synthetic rubber 

235
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,015
          into the mold         

236
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,219
   so that the printed lining   
       will show through.       

237
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,556
    the mirror-finish surface   
       of the mold cavity       

238
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,458
   produces a high-gloss boot.  

239
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,964
 the printed boot requires more 
   work and costlier materials  

240
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,300
and is therefore more expensive.

241
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,369
 after the molding, for example,

242
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,839
          it has to go          
    to the trimming station.    

243
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,107
   there, a worker shaves off   
         excess material        

244
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,642
    from the top of the boot.   

245
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,580
then he sews on a fabric binding
     to sandwich the lining.    

246
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,322
  the factory randomly selects  
     a boot from each batch     

247
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,392
 and puts it through a battery  
 of tests on this flex machine. 

248
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,195
  it bends the boot in various  
    ways some 300,000 times,    

249
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:36,367
 ensuring that these rain boots 
       can walk the walk.       

250
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,482
 narrator: when a construction  
 site is buzzing with activity, 

251
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,618
     it's usually the sound     
      of the circular saw.      

252
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,553
  its spinning teeth can take a 
 bite out of any job in seconds.

253
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,889
      there are many claims     
        to the invention        

254
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,224
      of the circular saw,      

255
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,927
    but there's no doubt that   
  when its design was perfected 

256
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,464
      in the last century,      
 it revolutionized woodworking. 

257
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,104
      with a circular saw,      
 you can give odd jobs a whirl, 

258
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,039
  and when the sawdust settles, 

259
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,042
     you may have discovered    
      your inner handyman.      

260
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,380
  to make a circular-saw blade, 

261
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,715
          a laser burns         
      into a sheet of steel     

262
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,452
     to cut out jagged disks    
       in the basic shape       

263
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,288
    of a circular-saw blade.    

264
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,127
 they feed each disk to rollers 

265
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,396
       that press grooves       
        onto both sides.        

266
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,531
          these grooves         
      are tensioning rings      

267
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,467
    that will keep the blade    
  from vibrating while cutting. 

268
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,736
     without these grooves,     

269
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,672
       the circular blade       
     wouldn't cut straight.     

270
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,276
      at the next station,      

271
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,478
   the assembler measures sags  
           and buckles          

272
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,613
    before feeding the disks    
          to a machine          

273
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,851
      that rolls them flat      
        like a pie crust.       

274
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,224
        a grinding wheel        
       polishes the blade.      

275
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,295
   and then they load barrels   
   of the disks into an oven    

276
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,564
to bake until they're very hard.

277
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,067
 this will take about 24 hours. 

278
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,971
     meanwhile, carbide tips    
      for the blades' teeth     

279
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,241
       funnel past a laser      
          that confirms         

280
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,110
   they're properly positioned  
       for the next step.       

281
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,046
      a robot then picks up     
        one tip at a time       

282
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,915
   and delivers it to nozzles.  

283
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,251
    the nozzles pump a paste    
      called flux onto it.      

284
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:39,057
  another robot places a piece  
  of solder metal on the flux.  

285
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,595
the next robot delivers the tips
     to the saw-blade body.     

286
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,598
 elements melt the solder metal 
            and flux            

287
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,067
    to fuse the carbide tips    
          to the teeth.         

288
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,870
it's a technique called brazing.

289
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,279
     teeth with carbide tips    
           last longer          

290
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,481
 without losing their sharpness.

291
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,757
  circular blades for sawmills  

292
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,026
          have a larger         
      and different design.     

293
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,761
         they brush flux        
       around a side hole       

294
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,233
 and then place soldering metal 
 on an elongated carbide tooth. 

295
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,241
      they braze the tooth      
     to the flux-coated hole    

296
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,844
    and install several more    
  of these carbide side teeth.  

297
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,180
   the side teeth will enable   
       this sawmill blade       

298
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,583
    to tear through big logs.   

299
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,189
 the smaller circular-saw blade 
      now spins on an axle      

300
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,658
      while a spray nozzle      
         sandblasts it.         

301
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,795
        the sandblasting        
       cleans the surface       

302
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,065
       and gives the blade      
       a brushed texture.       

303
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:02,073
  a mechanical finger now moves 
    one of the blade's teeth    

304
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,675
  into position for sharpening. 

305
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,712
        a grinding wheel        
       tapers each tooth.       

306
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,749
   a different wheel moves in   

307
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,986
 and grinds the outside diameter
          of the blade.         

308
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,023
       the geometric angle      
    of the grinding can vary,   

309
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,492
 depending on the type of blade 
           being made.          

310
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,030
  the grinding wheel then hones 
     the face of each tooth     

311
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,000
   to give it a sharper edge.   

312
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,840
next, a straightening specialist

313
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,843
 pounds out any remaining bumps 
         in the blade...        

314
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,047
     ...and double-checks it    
    with a straightedge tool.   

315
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,251
    he wipes off any smudges    

316
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,854
    and then holds the blade    
          to the light          

317
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,257
   and examines it to confirm   
      that it has no flaws.     

318
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:06,504
 a laser then etches the company
    insignia onto the blade.    

319
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,878
 and now the circular-saw blade 
   is ready for its close-up.   

320
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,681
  a camera focuses on the teeth 

321
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,550
      and sends the picture     
         to a computer.         

322
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,888
  it analyzes the cutting angle 
 and the clearance of each tooth

323
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,824
          to make sure          
      each one measures up.     

324
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,162
           the result           
     is circular-saw blades     

325
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,566
   that should be able to keep  
     their edge on the job.
