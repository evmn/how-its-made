   and strengthens the glass.   

370
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:25,156
    an inspector scrutinizes    
 the head with a tool to confirm

371
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,892
    that the connector joints   
     are in proper alignment    

372
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,128
         and positioned         
      at the correct angle.     

373
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,899
   workers install the vessel   
           on a stand,          

374
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,034
  insert the shaft and blades,  

375
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:41,239
         attach the head        
   and connect the condenser.   

376
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,107
    to simulate how it works,   

377
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,311
       a technician pours       
    liquid into the reactor.    

378
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:49,380
 he adds colorful plastic solids
    that will show up better    

379
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,782
     for this demonstration.    

380
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,585
          he activates          
      the impeller blades.      

381
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,789
    these blades are designed   
   to lift solids to the top,   

382
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,858
  and they do that effectively. 

383
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,195
  he also runs cooling liquids  
     through the condenser.     

384
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:08,333
 in practice, the cool coil will
  cause vapors from the vessel  

385
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,802
  to convert back to a liquid.  

386
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,939
  this lab reactor is now ready 
       to be a lifesaver.       

387
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,008
