00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:26,558
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,128
   plastic cups and cutlery...  

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,867
  ...special-effects makeup...  

6
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,505
           ...gold...           

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,244
          ...and harps.         

8
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,988
      the industry calls it     
    single-usage plasticware,   

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,125
 but that's just a fancy way to 
 say throwaway plastic dishes.  

10
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,261
     plastic plates, bowls,     
     drinkware, and cutlery     

11
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,264
 come in many styles and colors.

12
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,400
     so for your next party,    
      you can go disposable     

13
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,071
  for everything from champagne 
   flutes to parfait glasses.   

14
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,210
    factories make cutlery by   
  injecting plastic into molds. 

15
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,745
     they make cups, plates,    
            and bowls           

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,948
    using a different process   
      called thermoforming.     

17
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,818
    before the forming phase    
           can begin,           

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,621
       an automated system      
    loads polystyrene pellets   

19
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,890
         into a machine         
       called an extruder,      

20
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,626
         adding pigments        
      for colored plastic.      

21
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:38,163
 the extruder heats the pellets 
        until they melt.        

22
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:41,033
    then it forces the molten   
      plastic through a die     

23
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,836
  to shape a hard-plastic sheet 
about 8/100ths of an inch thick.

24
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,705
     they use molds to form     
     this continuous sheet      

25
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,707
       into plastic cups.       

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,779
 first, the sheet passes through
  an oven that's 10 feet long.  

27
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,316
    it heats the hard plastic   
   until it becomes malleable.  

28
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,252
         then it enters         
   the thermoforming machine,   

29
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,988
   which simultaneously pushes  
     and vacuums the sheets     

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,591
    into the mold cavities...   

31
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,860
 forming row after row of cups. 

32
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,397
    the entire process takes    
       just three seconds.      

33
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,400
      the cups then travel      
         to the trimmer,        

34
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:19,404
        which uses a die        
   to cut them off the sheet.   

35
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,806
      the machine grinds up     
      the leftover plastic      

36
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,876
 and remelts it into new sheets,

37
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,079
 so there's no loss of material 
           whatsoever.          

38
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,283
   the trimmer feeds the cups   

39
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,351
      directly to a machine     
       that stacks them...      

40
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,955
  then feeds them to a conveyor 
     belt in one long line.     

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,428
the conveyor transports them to 
a machine called the lip roller.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,165
 it reheats the cups just enough
  to make the plastic flexible. 

43
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,769
      then, as we see here      
         in slow-motion,        

44
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,039
     it folds the rim over,     
     forming a rounded lip.     

45
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,918
   they also make cutlery from  
   melted polystyrene pellets,  

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,654
as well as from polypropylene --

47
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:13,325
  a lighter, more flexible, and 
 less expensive type of plastic.

48
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,261
        the cutlery molds       
     consist of two halves.     

49
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,596
   you can see the difference   
       in this fork mold.       

50
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,200
    in one half, the utensil    
  cavities are right-side up -- 

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,935
    the fork prongs indented.   

52
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,805
 in the other half, the cavities
       are upside down --       

53
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,141
     the fork prongs raised.    

54
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,144
   a plastic-injection machine  
        melts the pellets       

55
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,880
 and injects the molten plastic 
         into the mold.         

56
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,815
    a built-in cooling system   
       solidifies the form      

57
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,685
      in about 10 seconds.      

58
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,487
   the extracted cutlery drops  
       to a conveyor belt       

59
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,757
   that leads directly to the   
 automated-packaging equipment. 

60
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,494
      for certain customers     
 such as fast-food restaurants, 

61
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,564
  the factory packages utensils 
          individually.         

62
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,234
 the automated wrapping machine 
 cuts polyethylene film to size,

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,369
     heat-sealing the ends.     

64
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,172
     this factory also uses     
     polypropylene pellets      

65
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,108
         to make straws.        

66
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,378
  the black beads are pigments  
      to color the plastic.     

67
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,714
         an extruder --         
  a different one this time --  

68
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,451
       melts the pellets,       
 then forces the molten plastic 

69
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,018
  through a circle-shaped die.  

70
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,523
  as the long, continuous straw 
       exits the extruder,      

71
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,760
      it cools and hardens      
   in a tank of chilled water.  

72
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,932
     as it leaves the tank,     

73
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,002
        a knife chops it        
     into individual straws.    

74
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,937
 they fall onto a conveyor belt 

75
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,739
     which transports them      
     to the packaging line.     

76
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,341
      just like the forks,      

77
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,811
    these straws will also be   
     individually wrapped --    

78
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,548
 but in paper, not plastic film.

79
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,220
 the wrapper machine feeds them 
 one-by-one into a paper sleeve.

80
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:51,857
 gears mesh the edges together, 
    creating a crimped seal.    

81
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,098
    the dies on this machine    

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,901
      turn ordinary straws      
       into flexible ones       

83
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,103
 by forming a corrugated section

84
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,840
   that lets you bend the top   
 of the straw toward your mouth.

85
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,110
     the machine compresses     
         the corrugation        

86
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,478
     to preserve the shape.     

87
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,384
  back to the plastic cups now. 

88
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,453
     this factory can print     
       customized designs       

89
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,056
       in up to six colors      
     applied simultaneously.    

90
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,693
     ultraviolet lamps built    
  right into the printing press 

91
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,595
     dry the ink instantly.     

92
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,465
           polystyrene          
    is naturally transparent.   

93
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,067
      combining two grades      
         of polystyrene         

94
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,937
       creates plasticware      
        that's semiopaque       

95
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,206
    and also highly flexible.   

96
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,819
            narrator:           
       on "how it's made,"      

97
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,155
        we usually stick        
       to the show's title      

98
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,957
    and show you how products   
        are manufactured.       

99
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,295
 but this next segment is about 
    special-effects makeup --   

100
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:07,232
the kind that makeup artists use
  on theater and movie actors.  

101
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,968
        so in this case,        
  we'll show you how it's made, 

102
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,304
     but we'll also show you    
        how it's applied.       

103
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,509
          watch as this         
  special-effects-makeup artist 

104
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,910
         works his magic        

105
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,781
  to transform this 28-year-old 
  woman into a senior citizen.  

106
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,784
  after gelling her hair flat,  
     he glued on a bald cap     

107
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,388
   using a theatrical adhesive  
       called spirit gum.       

108
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,057
    he protects her eyebrows    
          and eyelashes         

109
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,593
      with petroleum jelly,     

110
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,995
      then covers her face      
          in alginate,          

111
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,599
    a material generally used   
   to take dental impressions.  

112
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,401
         then he applies        
      wet plaster bandages.     

113
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,138
 after 25 minutes, the materials
       harden into a mask.      

114
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,941
  now he lines it with plaster. 

115
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,410
         in a half-hour,        
       the plaster hardens      

116
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,347
     into a perfect replica     
      of the woman's face.      

117
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:58,683
  like putting non-stick spray  
        on a baking pan,        

118
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,686
       he coats the model       
       in a release agent.      

119
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,756
 then, using professional-grade 
           plasticine,          

120
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,025
       he begins to sculpt      
        an elderly face.        

121
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,563
  he smoothes out the wrinkles  
  with strong rubbing alcohol   

122
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,833
   so they'll look realistic.   

123
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,502
   he uses a bumpy rubber pad   

124
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:22,039
        to give the skin        
  an aged orange-peel texture.  

125
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,910
     the finished sculpture     
 sits in water for 2 to 3 hours.

126
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,447
         this activates         
       the release agent,       

127
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,917
    detaching the plasticine    
  from the plaster underneath.  

128
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,387
    the artist carefully cuts   
  the sculpture into sections.  

129
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,722
   the number of pieces varies  

130
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,392
  with the size and complexity  
          of the mask.          

131
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,864
   now he can start producing   
       the mold he'll use       

132
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,599
   to cast the elderly woman's  
           face mask.           

133
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:53,538
 first, he takes a thin plaster 
    impression of each piece.   

134
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,208
  then he coats the impression  
           in plaster           

135
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,810
    to make the positive half   
          of the mold.          

136
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,214
   once it hardens, he applies  
      the plasticine piece      

137
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,149
       to space the depth       
       of the mold cavity.      

138
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,152
  then he coats that in plaster 

139
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,954
   to create the negative half  
          of the mold.          

140
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,757
        when it hardens,        
    he applies release agent    

141
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,760
     to both mold cavities,     
     pours in hot gelatin,      

142
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,162
      then closes the mold.     

143
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,497
         in a half-hour,        
       the gelatin hardens      

144
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,433
    into a flexible replica     
    of that particular piece    

145
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,969
  of the plasticine sculpture.  

146
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,307
   he implants synthetic hairs  
       to create eyebrows.      

147
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,175
    now, using surgical glue,   

148
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,645
 he begins to apply the pieces, 
       called prosthetics.      

149
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,249
   he starts with the largest   
        facepiece first.        

150
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,187
  it includes the nose, cheeks, 
      neck, and upper lip.      

151
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,457
 he cuts a hole in the chin area

152
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,693
      so that he can apply      
         the chinpiece.         

153
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,564
       now the lower lip.       

154
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,535
     he cuts off the excess,    

155
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,204
      then glues the edges      
        of the chinpiece        

156
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,873
     to the large facepiece.    

157
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,946
     now for the forehead --    

158
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,615
     again, he applies glue     
         along the edges        

159
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,284
   to connect it to the rest.   

160
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,490
        to age the eyes,        
     he uses contact lenses.    

161
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,960
       they create a ring       
       around the iris --       

162
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,362
        a typical feature       
        of elderly eyes.        

163
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,701
         using tweezers,        
      he applies eye bags,      

164
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,804
     again gluing the edges     
    to the rest of the mask.    

165
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,410
          and finally,          
      some wrinkly eyelids.     

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,514
 with the mask fully assembled, 
        it's makeup time.       

167
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,783
       using a toothbrush,      

168
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,119
  the artist sprays it unevenly 
         over the mask,         

169
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,788
         then smudges it        
        with his fingers.       

170
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,857
     this technique creates     
        a realistic look        

171
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,994
    because the human face --   
     aged skin especially --    

172
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,863
      has color variations.     

173
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:03,067
    using a very thin brush,    
  he accentuates some wrinkles  

174
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,271
        by creating depth       
      with a darker color.      

175
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,042
        now some freckles       
        and age spots...        

176
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,780
       ...and a gray wig.       

177
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,087
          and finally,          
     just a bit of lip color    

178
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,224
   because lips dull with age.  

179
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,494
         all this takes         
  an experienced makeup artist  

180
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,096
     about a month of work.     

181
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,865
       and such expertise       
       doesn't come cheap.      

182
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,635
a major transformation like this
       for stage or screen      

183
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,639
     can cost up to $10,000.    

184
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,521
  narrator: gold is the softest 
    and most malleable metal.   

185
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,790
        it can be pressed       
         extremely thin,        

186
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,591
  crafted into various shapes,  

187
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,994
     even drawn out to form     
          a fine wire,          

188
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,129
    and all without breaking.   

189
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:10,068
  gold isn't affected by water  
 or oxygen, as many metals are, 

190
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,537
 so it doesn't rust or tarnish. 

191
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,343
         most gold comes        
       from lode deposits,      

192
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,345
  also called vein deposits --  

193
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,750
concentrations of gold and other
 metals in the cracks of rocks. 

194
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,687
      lode deposits require     
        hard-rock mining,       

195
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,555
   using drilling and blasting  

196
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,391
   to remove gold-bearing rock  
           called ore.          

197
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,901
    miners descend more than    
    1,600 feet underground.     

198
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,705
     there they drill holes     
         for explosives         

199
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,442
       using what's called      
     a long hole air drill.     

200
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,449
           they drill           
      in a specific pattern     

201
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,820
   set out in a plan prepared   
    by the mine's engineers.    

202
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,993
the engineers know exactly where
     those veins of gold are    

203
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,462
 thanks to the mining company's 
           geologists,          

204
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:15,466
   who've studied ore samples.  

205
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,668
      the company collects      
          these samples         

206
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,938
 by drilling deep into the rock 
      at 50-foot intervals.     

207
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,943
   these diamond-drill cores,   
       as they're called,       

208
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:29,814
   are up to 330 feet long and  
 measure 1.5 inches in diameter.

209
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,084
    gold in its natural state   
           isn't pure.          

210
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,355
    it's usually intertwined    
  with silver or other metals.  

211
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:40,524
   so the mined ore has to be   
       processed afterward      

212
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,961
to isolate and extract the gold.

213
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:48,199
 a ton of ore yields only about 
  2/10ths of an ounce of gold.  

214
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,706
  after blasting the rock apart 
        with explosives,        

215
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,874
    miners use what's called    
         a muck machine         

216
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,645
   to transfer the ore to cars  
    headed to the main shaft    

217
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,081
      and then aboveground      
          to the mill.          

218
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,052
    there, a crusher reduces    
        the large chunks        

219
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,722
    into smaller rocks about    
    the size of road gravel.    

220
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,526
   a mill then pulverizes them  
  to the texture of beach sand. 

221
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,197
        the factory adds        
  a water and cyanide solution, 

222
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,400
   then another mill grinds it  
  further into a mud-like pulp. 

223
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,536
       the pulp flows into      
      large settling tanks.     

224
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,274
   the wet solids are heavier   
     and sink to the bottom.    

225
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,076
      the water at the top      
     drains to another area.    

226
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,346
  they transfer the wet solids  
      to an agitation tank      

227
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,548
        and blow in air.        

228
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,083
       the oxygen sets off      
       a chemical reaction      

229
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,220
       between the cyanide      
and the gold trapped in the ore,

230
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,955
 triggering the gold to dissolve

231
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,491
            and leach           
   into the surrounding water.  

232
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,896
   drum filters then separate   
   the water from the solids.   

233
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,566
 this water now joins the water 
   that was separated earlier.  

234
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,170
   they pour in zinc powder to  
   solidify the dissolved gold  

235
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,907
   and form pieces containing   
       both zinc and gold.      

236
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,442
     to smelt it into bars,     

237
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,111
     they first have to mix     
      several chemicals --      

238
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,580
      manganese dioxide...      

239
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,584
           fluoride...          

240
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,319
         silica flour...        

241
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,923
           ...borax...          

242
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,592
       and sodium nitrate.      

243
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,594
 this chemical mix, called flux,

244
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,464
     will separate the gold     
      from the impurities.      

245
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,266
 they pour it into the smelter, 

246
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:34,239
  whose temperature is a fiery  
    2,910 degrees fahrenheit.   

247
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,278
     they rotate the smelter    

248
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,016
      so that the contents      
  heat evenly over 2 1/2 hours. 

249
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,620
   the heavier gold eventually  
      sinks to the bottom,      

250
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,588
      while the impurities,     
          called slag,          

251
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,358
      float to the surface.     

252
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
     they pour out the slag,    

253
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,162
  taking a sample to make sure  
      it contains no gold.      

254
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:02,900
   if it does, it goes back in  
      until it's gold-free.     

255
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,703
        by now, the gold        
      has cooled slightly,      

256
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,107
        so they reheat it       
  to 2,910 degrees fahrenheit,  

257
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,443
          then cast it          
     into bar-shaped molds.     

258
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,780
      the gold takes about      
    four minutes to solidify.   

259
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,449
       it's put in a basin      
         of cold water,         

260
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,985
  where it will cool completely 
         after an hour.         

261
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,454
   they extract the gold bars   
         from the molds         

262
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,290
 and clean off any slag residue.

263
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,061
          gold bars are         
       also called ingots.      

264
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:34,131
         at this stage,         
      the gold is 80% pure.     

265
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,468
     the united states mint     
   will refine it to 99.9% --   

266
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,504
the international gold standard.

267
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,820
            narrator:           
    harps come in many sizes.   

268
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,289
          the type that         
    classical musicians play    

269
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,225
   is known as the orchestral,  
        or concert, harp.       

270
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,029
   it produces more tones than  
 any other stringed instrument. 

271
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,698
   the player plucks the harp   

272
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,101
 with the thumb and first three 
      fingers of each hand,     

273
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:13,171
     while at the same time     
     operating foot pedals.     

274
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,914
  the harp is one of the oldest 
       string instruments,      

275
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,717
 originating in the middle east 
      as early as 3000 b.c.     

276
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,521
     harps begin appearing      
     in europe in the 700s.     

277
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,191
       they initially had       
        a curved pillar.        

278
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:37,328
   by about 1500, this evolved  
 into a sturdier straight pillar

279
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,065
that could support more tension.

280
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,534
         as music became        
       more sophisticated,      

281
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,003
     they added a second row    
           of strings           

282
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,539
    as well as pitch-raising    
           mechanisms,          

283
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,876
  enabling the orchestral harp  
     to produce more notes.     

284
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,488
      this harp is a cross      

285
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,224
    between a classical harp    
       and a celtic harp.       

286
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,027
there's the pillar in the front,
   the sound box in the back,   

287
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,363
          and the neck          
     running across the top.    

288
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,366
   the sides of the sound box   
      are called the ribs.      

289
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,037
    they're made from pieces    
        of solid poplar,        

290
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,704
    3/10ths of an inch thick.   

291
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,442
  the instrument maker traces a 
 rib-shaped template on the wood

292
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:28,012
   and then cuts out the shape  
        using a band saw.       

293
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,718
         he clamps them         
       onto his worktable       

294
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,287
       and, with a plane,       
     makes them symmetrical.    

295
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,792
    now he draws three lines    
         across each rib        

296
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,729
 to mark where he'll cut slots. 

297
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,534
   you'll see what those slots  
        are for later on.       

298
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:53,470
next he glues on a notched strip
     of wood called a lining    

299
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,406
 to the curved side of the rib. 

300
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,142
       the lining enlarges      
      the glueable surface,     

301
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,812
        making it easier        
      to assemble the side      

302
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,880
  to the back of the sound box. 

303
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:07,351
  the notches enable the lining 
  to bend to the curved shape.  

304
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,758
   now he glues on the lining   

305
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,093
        that will connect       
  the straight side of the rib  

306
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,764
 to the front of the sound box. 

307
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,432
     he shaves off some wood    
       with a small plane,      

308
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,569
    then rounds off a corner.   

309
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,646
    he planes the back lining   
            as well,            

310
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,182
removing a corner to flatten it.

311
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,953
trimming the linings reduces the
final weight of the instrument. 

312
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,793
    now he cuts off the ends    
  of the linings on both sides  

313
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,864
 to be able to slide into place 
      the adjoining parts,      

314
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,399
       the bottom plate,        
       and the top plate.       

315
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:59,270
they're made of russian plywood,
   which is a piece of plywood  

316
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,739
    sandwiched between sheets   
          of birchwood          

317
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,408
    1/10th of an inch thick.    

318
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,279
     he glues the top plate     
   into place, then clamps it.  

319
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,082
        he does the same        
     with the bottom plate.     

320
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,620
       he closes the back       
        of the sound box        

321
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,888
       with what's called       
         the back plate.        

322
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,291
          it's also cut         
      from russian plywood.     

323
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,826
  he glues it onto the lining,  

324
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,762
     applying pressure with     
     tight rubber strapping.    

325
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,297
       when the glue dries      
       after about an hour      

326
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,900
  and the strapping comes off,  

327
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,636
      he marks the location     
       of the sound holes,      

328
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,638
   the holes from which sound   
      exits the instrument.     

329
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,175
   he constructs the top plate  
  on the front of the sound box 

330
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,576
       from solid spruce.       

331
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,113
     he lays the pieces down    
    from widest to narrowest,   

332
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,450
  then glues on a reinforcement 
   strip made of solid maple.   

333
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,653
        the strings pass        
        through the strip       

334
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,254
   and another on the inside.   

335
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,524
    they prevent the tension    
  from rupturing the top plate. 

336
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,793
he attaches a solid poplar frame

337
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,397
       to strengthen where      
the top plate and the ribs join.

338
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,865
          after sanding         
      with fine sandpaper,      

339
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,268
     he coats the sound box     
           in varnish.          

340
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,671
      remember those slots      
          in the ribs?          

341
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,274
     they now hold bracings     
 to prevent the ribs from bowing

342
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,877
        under the tension       
         of the strings.        

343
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,480
using a band saw, the instrument
       maker cuts the neck      

344
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,217
 from a board of russian plywood
      about an inch thick.      

345
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,753
   he makes a slot for gluing   
           the pillar,          

346
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,622
  also made of russian plywood. 

347
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,758
  once the varnish on the neck  
       and pillar are dry,      

348
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,227
       he hammers in pins       
        for the strings.        

349
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,563
        this type of harp       
         has 34 strings.        

350
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,167
  brass bridge pins space them  
          evenly apart.         

351
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,770
    steel zither pins adjust    
    the tension for tuning.     

352
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:44,508
he uses a wooden guide to hammer
  the pins to a uniform depth.  

353
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,845
  the three finished pieces fit 
 together with dowels and slots.

354
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,981
 he secures the joints with glue

355
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,650
        and a long screw        
       through the pillar.      

356
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,253
      strength is critical.     

357
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:01,191
   this harp has to withstand   
  790 pounds of string tension. 

358
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,594
        reaching through        
        the sound holes,        

359
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,664
 he threads the strings through 
    the reinforcement strips    

360
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,198
      to the pins outside.      

361
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,602
    these are nylon strings.    

362
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,737
            harps can           
    also have steel strings.    

363
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,541
 he winds them around the zither
    pins with a special key.    

364
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,810
          the last step         
       is to tune the harp      

365
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,546
          with the help         
     of an electronic tuner.
