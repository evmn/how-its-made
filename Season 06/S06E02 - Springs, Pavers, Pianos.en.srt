00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,624
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,526
springs...           

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,799
...pavers...          

4
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,438
...and pianos.         

5
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,720
a spring is a flexible metal device   

6
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,422
that returns to its original shape or position 

7
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,324
after it's stretched, squeezed, or twisted.     

8
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,462
springs were first used in clocks during the 16th century 

9
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,798
and, starting in the late 1800s,
in chair seats and bedding.  

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,067
today springs pop up all over. 

11
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,004
they're crucial components of modern technology.     

12
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,740
different types of springs   

13
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,474
include compression, on the right,         

14
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,743
and extension, on the left.  

15
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,145
during use,          

16
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,482
these torsion springs will twist at one or both ends.

17
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,218
workers start with rolls of steel cord.   

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,353
the cord diameters range in size

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,423
depending on the type of springs
being made.          

20
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,359
a machine called a dereeler unwinds the roll,       

21
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,229
feeding it to a computer-guided
forming machine.        

22
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,699
this forming machine forces the cord through a channel,  

23
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,902
shapes it into a coil, and then cuts it into segments.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,909
small wheels and a metal shaft guide the cord into shape.   

25
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,713
these are torsion springs for use in the automotive industry,

26
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,583
which relies heavily on a variety of springs.    

27
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,453
the average car, for example, has about 350 of them.     

28
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,454
a cone-shaped yellow sensor  

29
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,391
detects the correct angle of each spring.        

30
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,926
a good reading is required   

31
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,994
so the machine can move the next spring forward    

32
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,464
through the channel to be formed.         

33
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,468
this machine can produce up to 2,000 springs per hour, 

34
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,337
depending on their size.    

35
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:20,605
here another larger forming machine        

36
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:25,143
creates extension springs that are over 6 inches long.  

37
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,413
a mechanical arm grabs the coil
and chops it into segments   

38
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,816
after it's formed in a channel.

39
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,417
as the coil emerges,      

40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:37,089
another mechanical arm steadies 
it to prevent it from vibrating.

41
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,157
this keeps the spring tension constant,  

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,060
enabling the machine to produce at top speed.    

43
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,898
in slow motion, you can see how the machine  

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,168
grabs the coil's first ring and bends it to form a hook.  

45
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,206
this all takes place as the coil
emerges from the channel.   

46
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,510
a vise then secures the last ring on the end of the coil,  

47
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,048
while another arm twists it  
to make the spring's other hook.

48
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,985
slowed down, you see how two arms      

49
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,254
surround the coil being held in the vise.    

50
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,122
one arm then grabs the last ring

51
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,258
while the other arm twists it upward.       

52
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,398
this machine makes compression springs --  

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,135
a model with tapered ends   
that's often used in seat belts.

54
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,872
a metal probe detects the correct length of the springs 

55
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,473
after they're formed.     

56
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,211
the machine has four rotary shafts called cams.   

57
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,481
a computer ensures each spring has the desired specs.     

58
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,685
the springs are also heated to relax the metal.      

59
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,020
this gives them the ability to retain their shape     

60
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,455
after flexing.         

61
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,227
another machine creates longer,
thicker torsion springs.    

62
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,363
it shapes the cord into a coil with a shaft          

63
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,699
and then passes it over a tube to steady it.         

64
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,903
this ensures the spring will have the required tension.

65
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,174
springs can be as thin as a human hair        

66
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,243
or as thick as a broom handle. 

67
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,044
train wheels, for instance,  

68
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,381
include some of the industry's thickest compression springs.  

69
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,120
this machine makes another type of spring, 

70
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,322
often called wire forms.    

71
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,959
they're flexible steel cords curved or bent at an angle.   

72
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,997
these ones, shaped like a "w," are used in ovens.       

73
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,468
here, a worker places a spring into a machine         

74
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,269
that makes its hooks.     

75
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,940
he uses an adaptor to avoid hurting his fingers. 

76
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,075
he places each one individually

77
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,879
because specs for springs can vary by minute amounts.  

78
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,750
this company makes some springs
with hooks made of two rings  

79
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,085
instead of one.        

80
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,419
clients order them this way  

81
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,755
because the hooks are more durable.       

82
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,824
custom orders for springs   

83
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,361
can range from just a few to many thousand.       

84
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,363
this is another type of wire form.         

85
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,432
it'll be used in a firearm.  

86
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:04,503
a worker assembles it by hand because it's so intricate.   

87
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,971
after joining two base pieces, 

88
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,640
he places them into a small die.

89
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,909
using a foot pedal, he controls the die      

90
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,313
to bend the segments and complete the assembly.   

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,516
to check the compression spring's tension, 

92
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,718
a worker tests it with a weight gauge.      

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,386
the correct tension varies   

94
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,588
depending on what the client wants.       

95
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,923
a 1 1/2-inch long spring, for example,          

96
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,660
might need to withstand 5 pounds of tension      

97
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,062
when compressed to 1 inch.   

98
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,532
to test an extension spring,  

99
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,801
workers just add hooks to the weight gauge.      

100
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,004
whether they're extension, compression,          

101
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,007
torsion, or wire form,     

102
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,876
and whether they're inside pens
or satellites,         

103
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:50,048
springs prove that some    
old ideas definitely still work.

104
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,092
narrator: you could say that interlocking concrete pavers  

105
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,894
came out of the rubble of world war ii.        

106
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,495
in post-war holland,      

107
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,566
there weren't enough clay pavers
to rebuild city streets,    

108
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,034
so the dutch began making concrete pavers. 

109
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,704
the germans refined the technology     

110
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,772
and exported it to north america,       

111
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,642
and they found a quick road to success.    

112
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,915
these pavers are solid,    

113
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,985
and the interlocking design disperses weight,       

114
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,620
easing the load on the road.  

115
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,390
to make these pavers,     

116
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,126
a conveyor belt delivers concrete sand to a weigh belt 

117
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,196
that weighs the coarse sand as it falls onto it.      

118
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,133
the weigh belt carries the sand forward,   

119
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,734
while another conveyor belt  

120
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,138
unloads stone chips to be weighed.         

121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,142
these chips are no longer than an 1/8 inch.       

122
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,813
the ratio of sand to stone chips varies     

123
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,349
depending on the type of paver being made.      

124
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,419
the weigh belt transports the stone chips forward    

125
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,420
along with the coarse sand.  

126
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,956
both are en route to the skip hoist.       

127
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,025
they spill off the conveyor into the skip hoist,      

128
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,929
which is essentially a bucket on rails.       

129
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,633
cables pull the loaded bucket upwards.   

130
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,971
it stops about 30 feet up,   
just above a big concrete mixer.

131
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,841
a trap door opens and dumps the sand and stone chips    

132
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,776
into the mixer.        

133
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,981
six giant steel paddles mix and then rotate and mix again, 

134
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,184
while cement is added automatically     

135
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,718
through several nozzles    

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,254
on the side of this enormous mixing bowl. 

137
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,125
making pavers is a bit like baking cookies. 

138
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,127
too much or too little liquid in the batter,         

139
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,462
and it won't bake properly.  

140
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,466
water is added until the consistency is just right. 

141
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,937
nozzles also shoot a pigment into the mix to tint it.    

142
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,607
the mixture looks dry and crumbly,     

143
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,009
but the recipe gives it just enough moisture      

144
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,145
to form the concrete.     

145
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,882
now a filling wagon spreads the mix        

146
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:09,087
over a steel mold containing up to 50 paver-shaped cavities.

147
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,958
the mold presshead applies 11 tons of vibrating pressure. 

148
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,495
this pulsating force compacts the mixture in the paver mold 

149
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,031
and removes any air pockets, which could weaken the pavers. 

150
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,107
hydraulic cylinders lift the mold,         

151
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,576
leaving the pavers on the press board.      

152
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,111
the press board slides out,  

153
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,313
and the mold once again gets filled in         

154
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,183
and makes another 50 paver stones.        

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,387
it only takes about 10 seconds 

156
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:46,291
to mold, compact, and release a batch of pavers. 

157
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:53,832
the press boards filled with pavers slide into a rack. 

158
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,669
a hydraulic chain hoist lifts each board        

159
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,272
into a large holding rack.   

160
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:04,142
there, a special moving wagon, called a finger wagon,     

161
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,344
picks up all the boards from the rack         

162
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,280
in just one move.       

163
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,284
the electrical wagon moves along a rail to a curing kiln, 

164
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,420
where it's almost 100 degrees fahrenheit.    

165
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,222
the pavers actually generate the heat,  

166
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,025
due to a chemical reaction   

167
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,762
from the combination of cement and water.      

168
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,830
about 12 hours later,     

169
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,167
the finger wagon carts the pavers out of the kiln.  

170
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,837
they are now 70% cured as   
a result of the chemical process

171
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,506
that binds the cement, sand, and gravel,       

172
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,976
causing the pavers to harden. 

173
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:42,047
the rest of the curing will happen over the next 28 days. 

174
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,116
the pavers           
are now sturdy enough to handle,

175
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,518
so four steel arms with rubber pads move in    

176
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,721
and straighten the stones on the board.         

177
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,057
these alignment arms are hydraulically driven.   

178
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:57,596
they arrange the concrete pavers
so they interlock snugly.   

179
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,878
now hydraulic clamp arms lift the pavers off the board 

180
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,281
and begin to pile them up.   

181
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,423
they're making a cube of stone.

182
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,293
this stacking machine is called a cuber.       

183
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,496
it packs 9 or 10 layers of pavers on top of one another

184
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,364
to make this cube.       

185
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,701
the cube is actually called a bundle.  

186
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,171
it will be strapped and shipped out to the jobsite.

187

this sought-after material isn't used anymore       

191

because it's banned to protect elephants who were killed

but the techniques involved in manufacturing a piano    

195
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,811
haven't changed much and still rely on handcraftsmanship,   

196
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,548

to make a piano rim,      

203

automated rollers spread glue onto sheets of hard rock maple,

204

coating both sides.      

205
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,727
then they layer the glue-soaked
sheets 5 to 8 deep,      

206
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,329
depending on the model of piano.

207
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,733
workers feed the wet layers of wood to a rim press.

turns the clamp screws.    

210
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,608
the screws bend the wood into a piano rim form.     

211
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,210
they measure the pressure on the layers         

212
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,078
with a torque wrench.     

213

steel arms reach across the wood,

holding the shape while the glue dries.     

215

after 24 hours, workers loosen the machine's grip,      

216
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,357
and the rim now holds its contour.

a worker tightens the turnbuckles with a wrench. 

228
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,429
then he thumps it to make sure it's tight and won't rattle.  

229
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,268
next, they'll install the soundboard made of spruce

and the two bridges.      

231

he lowers wooden clamps over each rib         

236
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,554
to apply pressure while the glue dries.

that takes about an hour.   

238

next, he thins the ribs around the edges        

239
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,902
with an automated stagger-tooth shaper cutter.  

240
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,571
this will allow the soundboard to resonate freely       

241
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,907
when the piano is played.   

242

now they position the soundboard
in a bridge press.       

243
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,186
then they place a bridge-locating fixture   

244
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,855
on top of the soundboard.   

245

after the two bridges are glued down,        

248
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,666
they lower the soundboard onto the piano rim.      

249
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,736
then they hoist a cast-iron plate onto it.

this very sharp chisel     

257

cuts through the hard maple like butter.          

258
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,356
each notch will cradle three piano strings,      

259
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,093
giving them the freedom to vibrate.          

260

now they roll glue onto the outside case of the piano,

which is made of rosewood veneer on maple.

then they stand the entire piano
on its side.          

266
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,391
spinning cutters shape the arms
that sit next to the keyboard

they buff it up with this electrical cloth polisher.

00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,537
then to add glamour,      

285
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,474
they spray gold paint on the cast-iron plate.    

286
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,010
the next step involves the pin block,    

287
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,346
which holds all the stress.  

288
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,283
it bears 45,000 pounds of tension from the strings  

289
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,220
and transfers it to the iron plate.       

290
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,555
he drills into the maple pin block,   

291
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,624
through holes in the iron plate over it.   

292
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,559
the holes are for the tuning pins,    

293
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,095

the worker twists the end of the wire into a neat loop. 

297
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,307
then he hooks it onto a hitch pin

he snips the wire to the exact length that he needs.

303
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,929
then he wraps the wire on the tuning pin       

304
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,298
using a device called a stringing crank.   

305
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,536
he taps it into a hole in the pin block.       

306
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,739
then, using a pneumatic hammer,

307
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,909
he drives the tuning pins into the pin block.      

308
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,412
now the string stretches from above the bridge     

309
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,948
to the pin block.       

310
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,085
each string is under a tension of up to 425 pounds,      

311
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,888
again, a force that will be kept in check   

312
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,756
by the heavy cast-iron plate. 

313
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,426
now he places little felt-covered blocks   

314
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,162
called dampers above the strings       

315
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,365
to stop them from vibrating when a note is played.     

316
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:25,035
using pliers, he makes parallel
bends in the damper wires,   

317
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,837
so they're aligned.      

318
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,106
he pounds the key frame,    

319
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,974
checking for gaps that could cause knocks    

320
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,777
under a pianist's vigorous blows.        

321
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,246
he smoothes out the gaps,   

322
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:38,048
shaving off bits of wood with a strip of sandpaper   

323
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,251
attached to a handle.     

324
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,454
now another worker presses the piano keys     

325
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,988
in between steel guide pins  

326
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,459
that have been installed in rows on the key frame.   

327
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,997
she uses an air cylinder to push the backcheck     

328
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,199
into the end of a piano key.  

329
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,669
the backcheck is a piece of wood
covered with felt and buckskin 

330
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,404
that will catch the piano's hammer       

331
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,473
after it strikes a string.   

332
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,210
it's time to make those hammers.

333
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:10,548
she glues the felt-covered top onto a thin piece of hornbeam, 

334
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,150
a species of very strong wood. 

335
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,486
when a pianist hits a key,   

336
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,022
it will catapult the hammer into the string,        

337
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,892
and that produces a note.   

338
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:24,428
now she aligns the hammers to be perfectly parallel,    

339
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,964
using a plastic square as a guide.          

340
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,233
this is called "squaring it up."

341
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,572
next, she sands the tail of each hammer with a file   

342
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,842
so there'll be no sharp edges to damage the backcheck.    

343
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,711
then she attaches the hammers 

344
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,180
to the top of the keyboard with screws.          

345
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,983
now she places weights on each key          

346
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:50,321
and then gently taps the rail to get the hammers moving.   

347
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,523
she's testing the amount of effort it would take     

348
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,992
for a pianist to push each key down.     

349
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,961
this is called "the weigh off."

350
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,331
after she determines how much weight is needed,   

351
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,668
she marks a place on the side of the key     

352
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,936
and drills one or two holes.  

353
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,672
she plugs each hole with a piece of lead.     

354
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,474
in a process called swedging, 

355
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,676
she pushes a divot into the lead

356
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,746
so it expands and fits snugly into the key. 

357
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,882
the lead will counterbalance the weight of the hammers   

358
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,753
and give the key the required amount of weight. 

359
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,090
next, this technician     
checks each hammer and each key,

360
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,158
making subtle mechanical adjustments     

361
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,361
so they move smoothly and fluidly.          

362
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,831
it's the piano's first big tune-up.       

363
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,969
he fine-tunes the hammer action
by using a let-off tool    

364
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,238
to adjust the driving mechanism.

365
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,309
the piano is now ready for the hands of a skilled pianist 

366
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,779
and the ears of an appreciative audience.
