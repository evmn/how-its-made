           narrator:            
   today on "how it's made,"    

4
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,927
       cartridge blades,        

5
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,334
   chocolate banana loaves,     

6
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,206
       vending machines         

7
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:46,512
      and dive computers.       

8
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,388
    developed in the middle     
     of the 20th century,       

9
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,990
      the cartridge blade       
        is an invention         

10
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,259
   with many cutting edges.     

11
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:04,129
     the plastic cartridge      
     houses up to five razor    
            blades.             

12
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,998
     with multiple blades,      

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,267
     fewer shaving strokes      
       may be necessary,        

14
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,037
         which results          
      in a faster shave.        

15
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,075
      for the multibladed       
       cartridge razor,         

16
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,877
     getting rid of stubble     
        is no trouble.          

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,946
      when the many blades      
         become dull,           

18
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,948
         the cartridge          
   can simply be popped out     

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,618
          and replaced          
        with a new one.         

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,554
 making cartridge blades starts 
   with coiled steel strips     

21
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:32,024
  that are a few miles long.    

22
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,226
       the strips unwind        
     around guide rollers       

23
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,697
        that orient them        
for entry into punch machines.  

24
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:43,636
 revolving cylinders help feed  
     the steel strips to the    
            punches.            

25
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,972
     the punches cut holes      
         in the steel,          

26
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:49,175
        spacing them at         
      precise intervals.        

27
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,243
        these holes will        
  allow production machinery    

28
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,644
       to grip the steel        

29
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,782
      and move it through       
   the blade-making process.    

30
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,518
   machinery pulls the steel    
   ribbons through an oven,     

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,456
 which heats them to a searing  
   1,832 degrees fahrenheit.    

32
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,126
     the steel then enters      
      a cooling chamber,        

33
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,128
   followed by another oven.    

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,663
    the temperature extremes    
             change             

35
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:13,132
      the steel's molecular     
           structure.           

36
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,735
      it becomes harder and     
           stronger.            

37
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,938
       the steel rewinds        
       and then unwinds         

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,740
    between grinding stones     

39
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,808
       that hone the edge       
       into a very sharp        

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,910
     gothic arch profile.       

41
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:31,484
 they're now ready to break the 
 steel into individual blades.  

42
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:37,089
  a mechanical punch snaps it.  
    and it breaks cleanly.      

43
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,759
     with a skewer holding      
   the blades in alignment,     

44
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:44,763
    a technician scrutinizes    
  the edges for any defects.    

45
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,966
    after applying coatings     
          to prevent            

46
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,634
   rust and add durability,     

47
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:51,636
      they bake the blades      
     in a special furnace.      

48
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,774
    this binds the coatings     
        to the blades.          

49
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,844
      at another station,       
they transform plastic pellets  

50
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,046
  into the razor cartridges.    

51
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,781
this machine melts the pellets  

52
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,250
     and injects the liquid     
      plastic into molds        

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,385
    as pressure is applied.     

54
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,054
    the plastic solidifies      

55
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:13,125
         into the shape         
     of razor cartridges.       

56
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,128
  the cartridges bounce along   
      a circular feeder.        

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,131
    the feeder orients them     
         front-side-up          

58
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,667
     and then funnels them      
    into the next machine.      

59
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,542
 this one resembles an octopus  
   with numerous tentacles.     

60
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,278
   the tentacles are robots.    

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,813
      the first one places      
        the cartridges          

62
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,115
          in a fixture          
     on a revolving table.      

63
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,019
      as the table turns,       

64
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,353
  it serves up the cartridges   

65
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,256
       to the next robots       
     in the assembly line.      

66
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,762
      in quick succession,      
       these robots snap        

67
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:54,100
     a total of five blades     
     into the cartridges.       

68
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,234
     by now, the holes used     
      to move the blades        

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,772
  through the assembly process  
    have been trimmed off.      

70
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,208
    and it's a perfect fit.     

71
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,981
  they now place back casings   
  in front of the cartridges    

72
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:12,184
  and install pieces of metal   
         on the parts.          

73
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,521
        the metal pieces        
    are sacrificial anodes.     

74
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,790
       their sole purpose       
      is to be sacrificed       

75
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,527
      to corrosive forces       
      to save the blades.       

76
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,596
    after that, robots flip     
       the back casings         

77
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,132
       then transfer them       
    to the cartridge blades     

78
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,135
  and click them into place.    

79
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,141
  the cartridge blades are now  
       fully assembled.         

80
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,212
    the robotic system takes    
      them into a station       

81
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,482
       with more quality        
       control cameras.         

82
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,217
   if no problems are found,    

83
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,954
      the blades move into      
  another mechanized system.    

84
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,824
       this one installs        
   a temporary plastic cover    

85
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:53,425
    to protect the consumer     

86
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,662
   and keep the blades sharp    
 until it's time for a shave.   

87
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,900
      robotic arms pick up      
 the clear plastic protectors   

88
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,235
         two at a time          

89
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,505
    and place them in slots     
   in the assembly machine.     

90
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,510
         they then snap         
     the cartridge blades       

91
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,479
   into the plastic covers.     

92
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,251
 with the protectors in place,  

93
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:22,120
 the robots send the cartridge  
      blades down a chute       

94
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,322
        and into a bin.         

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,324
       they're now ready        
          for retail            

96
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,328
        and the business        
     of personal grooming.      

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,548
           narrator:            
   many schools today require   

98
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,016
      to be allergy-free        

99
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,218
   because so many children     

100
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,687
     have life-threatening      
          to peanuts,           

101
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,155
 tree nuts or dairy products.   

102
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,291
     often, these allergies     
         are so severe          

103
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,027
       that just touching       
   or inhaling the allergen     

104
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,631
    can cause a potentially     
       deadly reaction.         

105
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,234
   these kid-sized chocolate    
  chip banana loaves contain    

106
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,504
     no peanuts, tree nuts      
      or dairy products.        

107
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,840
   nothing else this company    
      makes contains them       

108
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,376
      either to eliminate       
        any possibility         

109
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,645
    of cross-contamination.     

110
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,912
   as a further precaution,     

111
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,382
      all the ingredients       
      come from suppliers       

112
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,918
   whose facilities are also    
       entirely peanut,         

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,187
   tree nut and dairy-free.     

114
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:31,457
      to make the batter,       
 workers first combine water,   

115
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,659
     canola oil and sugar.      

116
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,928
  then they add pureed banana   

117
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,964
 and mix until the ingredients  
       are well blended.        

118
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,936
     they add wheat flour,      
        then sea salt,          

119
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:47,606
 baking soda and preservatives  
     such as citric acid,       

120
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,607
         routinely used         
      in packaged foods,        

121
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,412
     to prevent the growth      
     of bacteria and mold.      

122
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,415
     the final ingredients      
           are eggs             

123
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,084
      and chocolate chips,      
      not milk chocolate        

124
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,554
      because these snacks      
        are dairy-free.         

125
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,689
    instead, chocolate chips    
        are custom-made         

126
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,292
        for this bakery         
  by a producer of certified    

127
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,361
     kosher pareve foods,       

128
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,429
 meaning the products contain   

129
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,833
        neither meat nor        
      dairy ingredients.        

130
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,501
    a pump moves the finished   
             batter             

131
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,837
      from the mixing bowl      
       to a large hopper        

132
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,908
         that feeds the         
  automated production line.    

133
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,443
  at the start of that line,    

134
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:28,713
 more than 620 loaf baking pans 
   pass under spray nozzles,    

135
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,217
   which lightly grease them    
       with canola oil.         

136
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:37,655
 this prevents the baked loaves 
   from sticking to the pan.    

137
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,525
         then the pans          
     enter the depositor,       

138
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:45,197
    which drops 1.5 ounces of   
             batter             
    into each loaf cavity.      

139
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,569
    this one batch of batter    
    produces 6,666 loaves.      

140
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,207
     the filled pans enter      
  a multilevel vertical oven    

141
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,611
    in which they zigzag up     
   and down 13 baking zones     

142
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,480
   of varying temperatures.     

143
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,418
       after 27 minutes,        
  the loaves are fully baked.   

144
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,219
      however, they can't       
        be packaged yet         

145
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,290
  because they're piping hot.   

146
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,891
   so the next station on the   
              line              

147
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,629
    is a multilevel vertical    
       cooling chamber.         

148
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,498
 its fans draw out the hot air  

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,368
    while blowers introduce     
      filtered cold air.        

150
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,574
       when the pans exit       
      the cooling chamber       

151
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,375
    about 25 minutes later,     

152
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,611
      the loaves are just       
        slightly warm.          

153
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,052
      a robot now descends      
    on two pans at a time.      

154
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:43,388
       it jabs the loaves       
 with needles to lift them out  

155
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,458
   then withdraws the needles   
   to drop them on a conveyer   
              belt              

156
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,095
   that's ventilated to help    
  the loaves finish cooling.    

157
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,000
    this belt transfers them    
       to a narrower one        

158
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,236
           that leads           
    to the packaging area.      

159
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,941
     there, workers line up     
   the loaves in single file    

160
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,277
     on a track that leads      
   to the wrapping machine.     

161
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,147
      each loaf is roughly      
       3 1/2 by 2 inches        

162
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,617
    and 1 1/2 inches high.      

163
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:15,220
  even though each one started  
               out              
  as 1 1/2 ounces of batter,    

164
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,890
    some moisture evaporated    
        during baking,          

165
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:22,828
    reducing the final loaf     
     weight to 1.4 ounces.      

166
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,230
       under the watchful       
       eye of a sensor,         

167
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,999
        the loaves enter        
     the wrapping machine       

168
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,069
   where printed transparent    
      film envelops them.       

169
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,839
   the two edges of the film    

170
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,776
        overlap slightly        
    underneath the loaves.      

171
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,311
  the machine seals the edges   

172
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:43,315
       with a combination       
     of heat and pressure.      

173
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,450
 then it simultaneously seals   

174
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,387
       and cuts the film        
    in between the loaves.      

175
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,459
   each chocolate chip banana   
              loaf              
 is now individually wrapped.   

176
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,796
    workers pack the snacks     
  into the retail packaging.    

177
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,937
         the box moves          
     into a glue machine,       

178
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,905
    which seals the flaps.      

179
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,746
      the bakery conducts       
several quality control checks  

180
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,215
     throughout production,     
         for example,           

181
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,885
     testing the viscosity      
  and ph level of the batter.   

182
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,155
         it also tests          
     the finished product.      

183
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,290
         once per hour,         
      they cut up a loaf        

184
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,959
      and place the pieces      
    in a moisture analyzer.     

185
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,761
      the correct moisture      
         level ensures          

186
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,030
       that the loaf has        
     a proper cake texture      

187
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,098
         and isn't dry          

188
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,701
        because as much         
      as this snack needs       

189
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,570
      to be safe for kids       
        with allergies,         

190
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,106
  it also has to taste great.   

191
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,321
   narrator: vending machines   
      are a common sight        

192
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,723
       in public places.        

193
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,457
        the first modern        
       vending machines         

194
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,728
        in 1880s england        
   didn't sell food at all.     

195
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,730
   they dispensed postcards.    

196
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:08,333
   nowadays, automated vending  
               has              
come full circle with machines  

197
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,802
     selling not just food      
        but electronics         

198
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,005
   and other consumer goods.    

199
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,940
           thirsty?             

200
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,007
     just select a drink.       

201
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,476
        enter its number        
        on the keypad.          

202
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,812
    the led monitor displays    
      what you've chosen        

203
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,413
    and how much it costs.      

204
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,283
    then insert the money.      

205
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,018
the monitor shows your credit,  

206
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,552
     how much you've paid.      

207
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,354
   the credit resets to zero    

208
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,223
        when the machine        
      releases your drink       

209
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:35,694
        and returns any         
      change you're due.        

210
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,162
      the vending machine       
    has a welded steel body     

211
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,767
  onto which workers assemble   
     the other components       

212
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,369
        such as the see         
     -through refrigerator      

213
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,940
       and an lcd monitor       
    to display advertising.     

214
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,045
 workers assemble the machine's 
  payment and display system,   

215
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,082
  starting with the machine's   
        control board.          

216
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,787
  they install the led monitor  
        and the keypad,         

217
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,423
      which are integrated      
      into a single unit.       

218
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,195
     after bolting the unit     
    securely in its window      

219
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,664
        in the housing,         

220
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,004
 the workers screw the control  
   board securely in place,     

221
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:23,075
   then plug the led monitor    
and the keypad into the board.  

222
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,079
      they install the coin     
           acceptor.            

223
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,818
  it can be set up to recognize 
               up               
    to 16 different types of    
             coins.             

224
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,686
        when a customer         
        inserts money,          

225
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:38,223
  the coin acceptor transmits   
    the value to the control    
             board,             

226
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,426
   which displays the amount    
      on the led monitor,       

227
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,895
       calculates it into       
   the purchase of the item     

228
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,296
 and directs the coin acceptor  

229
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,034
    to dispense any required    
            change.             

230
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:52,370
     next, workers install      
    the bank note acceptor.     

231
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,440
 it identifies the denomination 
      of an inserted bill       

232
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,375
 with an optical scanner and,   

233
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,578
          to make sure          
   the currency is genuine,     

234
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,112
   measures fluorescent ink     

235
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,182
         with uv light          
     and reads magnetic ink     
            printing            

236
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,852
              with              
      a magnetic scanner.       

237
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:10,255
 it sends the value of the bill 
     to the control board.      

238
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,124
       they plug the data       
        transfer cables         

239
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,793
    from the money acceptors    
    into the control board      

240
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,995
       along with a cable       
      for the controllers       

241
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,931
   that operate the machine's   
    product release motors      

242
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,332
 and the data transfer cables   

243
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,201
      coming from the two       
         coin hoppers,          

244
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,806
   which collect the inserted   
              coins             
     and dispense change.       

245
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,676
       then they close up       
the machine with cover panels.  

246
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,945
      a worker constructs       
    the product feed trays      

247
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,215
    that go into the vending    
    machine's refrigerator.     

248
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,484
         the first step         
    is to attach partitions     

249
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:43,288
     to a back panel to form    
            columns.            

250
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,623
   each column's width is set   
      to the dimensions,        

251
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,961
  weight and type of packaging  
     of the product it will     
           dispense,            

252
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,364
    from small featherlight     
         bags of chips          

253
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,834
     to heavy glass beverage    
            bottles.            

254
00:13:55,836 --> 00:14:00,571
    a feed tray can have up     
        to six columns.         

255
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,175
   the trays are constructed    
  entirely of stainless steel   

256
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,778
     because it withstands      
   refrigeration temperature    

257
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,214
        and doesn't rust        
   when exposed to moisture.    

258
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,654
    workers install a motor     
  at the back of each column.   

259
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,123
   once the tray's installed    
        in the fridge,          

260
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,460
     those motors plug into     
      the control board.        

261
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:24,129
     when the customer pays     
   for the selected product,    

262
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,265
 the board activates the motor  
 for the corresponding column   

263
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,734
    to release the product.     

264
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,736
      side-by-side columns      
    designed to be stocked      

265
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,073
     with the same product      
      have linked motors.       

266
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,141
        that way, if one        
       column sells out,        

267
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,680
    the linked one with more    
 of the same product kicks in.  

268
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:45,350
  each motor moves the product  
  with a steel drive spring.    

269
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,887
   there are seven different    
       sizes of springs.        

270
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,556
    workers install the size    
 that has the correct spacing   

271
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,824
       between the rolls        

272
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,426
        that corresponds        
       to the dimensions        

273
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:58,095
      of the product being      
  dispensed from that column.   

274
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,432
     once the customer pays     
      for the selection,        

275
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,768
       the motor rotates        
    the spring 360 degrees      

276
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,503
    to release the product      

277
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,639
   and move the one behind it   
   to the front of the line.    

278
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,643
   once all the product feed    
     trays are installed,       

279
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,444
       workers adjust the       
          refrigerator          

280
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,782
      thermostat and stock      
         the products.          

281
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,517
  then they test the machine.   

282
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,187
 first, they purchase a product 
     with paper currency.       

283
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,256
         they make sure         
   the bills feed smoothly,     

284
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,991
         that the bank          
      note acceptor sends       

285
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,726
         the right data         
     to the control board,      

286
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,063
   that the board calculates    
  the transaction accurately    

287
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,800
         and activates          
      the correct motor.        

288
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,470
     they run the same test     
    with the coin acceptor      

289
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:41,339
    to make sure its sensors    
  correctly detect the coin,    

290
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:45,010
           dimension,           
       weight and chemical      
          composition           

291
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,678
          and transmit          
     accurate information       

292
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,814
     to the control board,      

293
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,550
       all this to ensure       
 the vending machine customers  

294
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,120
          get exactly           
      what they paid for.       

295
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,240
           narrator:            
   dive computers help divers   

296
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,909
     these wrist computers      
     keep tabs on the time      

297
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,311
    and depth of the dive.      

298
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,713
       and they calculate       
        a safe ascent.          

299
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:25,250
     the journey back to the    
             surface            
 must often be done in stages,  

300
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:28,920
 or the diver could fall victim 
  to decompression sickness.    

301
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,725
       a dive computer is       
    something someone wears     

302
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,128
       when they're ready       
      to take the plunge.       

303
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,264
     strapped to the wrist      
         like a watch,          

304
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,267
  it provides critical safety   
     data during the dive.      

305
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,872
     they start with panels     
     of four printed circuit    
            boards.             

306
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,874
     a technician confirms      
        that the tracks         

307
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:52,076
     and pads are correctly     
            located.            

308
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,146
  a conveyor then takes one of  
   the panels into a machine    

309
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,548
   that precisely positions     

310
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,150
          a metal mesh          
       stencil over it.         

311
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,486
     an automated squeegee      
     spreads solder paste       

312
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,954
    onto the circuit boards     

313
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,224
     through the open areas     
        of the stencil.         

314
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,493
        the solder paste        
       will act as glue         

315
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:12,097
       for over 100 tiny        
    electrical components.      

316
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:20,305
    next, the circuit boards    
             receive            
 those electrical components.   

317
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,575
       a robot peels them       
      off plastic strips        

318
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,510
       and places them on       
      the soldered areas        

319
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:31,182
     at an impressive rate      
  of 13,000 pieces per hour.    

320
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,652
           the parts            
   include microprocessors,     

321
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,254
   sensors and memory chips.    

322
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,522
    then the circuit boards     
       head into an oven        

323
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,394
     with several different     
  heating and cooling zones.    

324
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,462
         as they travel         
     through these zones,       

325
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,064
 the soldering particles melt   

326
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,801
     to bond the components     
    to the circuit boards.      

327
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,936
        passing through         
      the cooling zones,        

328
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,137
      the solder hardens.       

329
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:57,341
and this solidifies the bonds.  

330
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,411
       the circuit boards       
       have now received        

331
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,379
  all of the necessary parts.   

332
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,151
      a technician places       
  the panel of circuit boards   

333
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,021
        in an automated         
  optical inspection machine.   

334
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,556
      here, a camera takes      
    a picture of the panel      

335
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,626
  and sends it to a computer.   

336
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,761
       the computer scans       
      the circuit boards        

337
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,363
    for missing components,     

338
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:22,767
       positioning errors       
    and soldering defects.      

339
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,168
    if there are no flaws,      

340
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,639
       the panels move on       
   to a programming station.    

341
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:31,576
       here, a technician       
 positions them under probes.   

342
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,845
       the probes descend       
       and load software        

343
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,181
   into the microprocessors.    

344
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,649
   this brings them to life     

345
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,183
  and enables them to control   

346
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:43,054
 all of the board's functions.  

347
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,456
    another technician trims    
      and cuts the panels       

348
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,492
     using circular saws.       

349
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,063
      she then punches out      
 the four round circuit boards  

350
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,065
 and transfers them to a tray   

351
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,268
    that has an electrically    
      conductive surface.       

352
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,070
    the surface protects the    
             boards             

353
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,339
        from mechanical         
     and electrical shocks      

354
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,940
      until they're ready       
        to be assembled         

355
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,810
into the dive computer module.  

356
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,013
      now the fabrication       
    of that module begins.      

357
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:13,551
 the technician places a buzzer 
 mechanism behind a backlight.  

358
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,219
 she transfers the two of them  

359
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,490
      to the reverse side       
     of a display screen.       

360
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,493
      she places a plastic      
       framework on top.        

361
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,229
     and she inserts rubber     
       connectors in it.        

362
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,364
   these little rubber parts    
   will make the connection     

363
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:31,302
   between the circuit board    
   and the digital display.     

364
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,704
   the next assembler inserts   
       the circuit board        

365
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,573
into the digital display unit.  

366
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,781
    she installs a temporary    
            battery             

367
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,316
 and checks the digital monitor 
          to confirm            

368
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,052
     that it's functional.      

369
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,655
  satisfied that it's in good   
        working order,          

370
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,091
she sets it aside temporarily.  

371
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,664
       in the next stage        
        of production,          

372
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,665
      the worker removes        

373
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,133
       any dust particles       
        from the screen         

374
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,469
   using blasts of compressed   
              air.              

375
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,139
       she snaps the dive       
        computer module         

376
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,008
   into a tough plastic case    

377
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,746
  that's designed to withstand  
   a lot of water pressure.     

378
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:17,214
    she cleans a glass face     
      plate and places it       

379
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,818
   over the digital screen.     

380
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,222
  this face plate will protect  
    the screen from water.      

381
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,025
         the next part          
       is a metal bezel.        

382
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,559
  it surrounds the face plate   

383
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,229
        and will be used        
  to secure it to the casing.   

384
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,300
 she flips the assembly around  

385
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,037
      and screws the bezel      
  to the case from the back.    

386
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,278
    she inserts the computer    
             battery            
  into a titanium back plate.   

387
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,519
       she then installs        
     the battery assembly       

388
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:59,190
   in the back of the module    
  and secures it with screws.   

389
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:05,263
    this completes the dive     
       computer module.         

390
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,466
       all that's left is       
  to attach the wrist strap,    

391
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,335
     and this dive computer     
 is ready to probe underwater   

392
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,372
          and provide           
 critical safety information.
