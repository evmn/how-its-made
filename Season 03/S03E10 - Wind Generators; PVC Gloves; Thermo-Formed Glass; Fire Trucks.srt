00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,190
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,293
        wind generators.        

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,899
           pvc gloves.          

6
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,772
       thermoformed glass.      

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,878
        and fire trucks.        

8
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,587
         wind generators        
  harness the power of the wind 

9
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,656
     to produce electricity.    

10
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,991
as the turbine's blades revolve,

11
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,861
       they drive a rotor       
      that generates power.     

12
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,330
         this can charge        
       a set of batteries       

13
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,799
          or even feed          
      a transmission grid.      

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,037
wind power is a renewable energy
  source that doesn't pollute.  

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,276
   this type of wind generator  
     is a recreational model    

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,812
    designed to power a boat    
          or a cottage          

17
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:25,017
      with up to 500 watts      
         of electricity.        

18
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,885
     to make the propeller,     

19
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,488
       they lay a template      
  on a plank of western cedar,  

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,625
      a rot-resistant wood      
  that's flexible and durable,  

21
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,894
     yet lightweight enough     
    for the slightest breeze    

22
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,762
       to set it spinning.      

23
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,968
after tracing, they drill a hole
 at each end and in the middle, 

24
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,373
 then remove the template and do
  a rough cut using a band saw. 

25
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,642
      they put the template     
         back in place,         

26
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:55,313
 using those holes they drilled 
to align and secure it in place.

27
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,318
    using a router this time,   
    they do a precision cut.    

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,455
    the plank of wood now has   
   the contour of a propeller.  

29
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,259
          the next step         
     is to form the profile.    

30
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,327
 to do that, they bolt the wood 

31
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,597
       onto the right side      
 of a specially designed device 

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,799
            called a            
   propeller-carving machine.   

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,936
        on the left side        
      is a model propeller.     

34
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,472
    after adjusting the model   
      to the proper angle,      

35
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,642
       they start to cut.       

36
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,817
     as the machine's roller    
      runs over the model,      

37
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,787
   it guides a shaver to carve  
the wood exactly like the model.

38
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,566
   it takes about eight passes  

39
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,469
 to get the propeller's profile 
           just right.          

40
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,713
  you can see the profile well, 

41
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:05,450
 once they've marked and cut off
     the excess on the ends.    

42
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,253
        one side is flat,       

43
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:12,924
    while the other is curved   
    like an airplane's wing.    

44
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,327
     now they widen the hole    
 in the middle of the propeller 

45
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,665
     and sand off the ridges    
       left by the carving      

46
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,268
      using a low-pressure      
     inflatable drum sander.    

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,003
       it's the only type       
         flexible enough        

48
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,739
 to really get into the curves. 

49
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,742
 next they check the balancing. 

50
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:35,013
watch how a mere penny can throw
  off this perfect equilibrium. 

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,884
         finally, a coat        
  of waterproof epoxy paint --  

52
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,021
          the kind used         
     on the hulls of boats.     

53
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,156
        now they assemble       
         the alternator,        

54
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,626
          the component         
   that generates electricity   

55
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,028
    when the propeller spins.   

56
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,297
      they wrap insulation      
      around what's called      

57
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,367
        the "proportional       
      electronic regulator"     

58
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,835
      and then install it,      
       along with wiring,       

59
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,571
  into the alternator's casing. 

60
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:04,642
   this regulator controls the  
 electrical charge and current. 

61
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,445
          the propeller         
     spins this rotor shaft,    

62
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,648
  creating an electrical charge 

63
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,851
    that sends a current from   
the alternator to the batteries.

64
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,588
 once the casing's bolted shut, 

65
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,592
    they mount a cooling fan    
 on the shaft's protruding axle.

66
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,596
  this fan will expel the heat  
  all that spinning generates.  

67
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,832
  next they assemble the parts  

68
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,200
   that make up what's called   
      the "lolly shaft" --      

69
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,070
        the axis on which       
       the propeller sits.      

70
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,871
 this axis enables the propeller

71
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,407
  to pivot toward the direction 
           of the wind          

72
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,845
   without twisting the wires   
   that run to the batteries.   

73
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,815
 finally, they connect the wires

74
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,618
      from the lolly shaft      
       to the alternator.       

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,154
        this rubber cover       
     protects the connection    

76
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,555
       from the elements.       

77
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,092
 now they assemble what's called
    the propeller governor --   

78
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,696
  a key component that prevents 
 the propeller from overspinning

79
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,831
and breaking down in high winds.

80
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,233
       when the propeller       
         spins too fast,        

81
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,371
      the centrifugal force     
     pulls on these springs.    

82
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,439
         this activates         
       the braking flaps,       

83
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,909
         generating drag        
   to slow the propeller down.  

84
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,980
   again, precision balancing   
          is critical.          

85
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,583
     otherwise, you'll have     
     a damaging vibration.      

86
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,386
         after applying         
    the manufacturer's decal,   

87
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,388
           they mount           
     the propeller's rudder     

88
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,459
        onto the back end       
 of the wing generator's frame. 

89
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,328
        on the other end,       
  they install the alternator,  

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,198
    followed by the propeller   
     and propeller governor,    

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,732
       both painted black       

92
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,002
    to protect the waterproof   
       coating underneath       

93
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,172
         from the sun's         
       damaging u.v. rays.      

94
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,751
  narrator: polyvinyl chloride, 
    commonly known as "pvc,"    

95
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:56,555
      is a durable material     
       similar to plastic.      

96
00:05:56,557 --> 00:06:00,292
  pvc gloves are waterproof --  
      even chemical-proof.      

97
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,760
all kinds of laborers wear them,

98
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,765
    from commercial fishermen   
    to oil-refinery workers.    

99
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:16,574
   pvc gloves are comfortably   
      flexible, yet sturdy.     

100
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,044
        production begins       
     at the cutting station     

101
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,581
       with stacked sheets      
       of cotton flannel.       

102
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,385
    using a hydraulic cutting   
  machine and a series of dies, 

103
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,987
   workers slice through some   
  20 layers in one fell swoop,  

104
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,992
 cutting out the pieces required
     to make cotton gloves.     

105
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,728
          those gloves          
    will either be sold as is   

106
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,898
       or used as linings       
         for pvc gloves.        

107
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,342
          the next step         
 is to sew the pieces together. 

108
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,222
  it takes a speedy seamstress  
    just 30 seconds per hand.   

109
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,163
    next they sew on a wrist    

110
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,099
       made of a stretchy,      
     cotton-and-lycra knit.     

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,371
      this seamstress works     
the wristing machine so quickly,

112
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,639
 we had to ask her to slow down 

113
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,776
  so that we could actually see 
        what she's doing.       

114
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,116
 throughout the sewing process, 

115
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,453
       these cotton gloves      
      have been inside out.     

116
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,589
        this next machine       
    turns them right-side in,   

117
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,660
        transferring them       
    onto a heated hand form.    

118
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,241
    the machine then presses    
    each glove onto the form.   

119
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:07,352
      the gloves drop down      
    to a conveyor belt below.   

120
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,687
 it transports them to a worker,

121
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,392
   who inspects them and pairs  
   them up -- left and right.   

122
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,763
    elsewhere in the factory,   

123
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,701
         workers prepare        
        the pvc solution.       

124
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,570
        the recipe varies       
  according to the glove model, 

125
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,505
     but generally consists     
           of coloring          

126
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,108
        and five to eight       
      different chemicals.      

127
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,645
   they add in antibacterial,   
       antifungal solution      

128
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,315
         to combat odor         
     from hand perspiration.    

129
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,184
        to apply the pvc,       

130
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,787
    workers slip a metal form   
 into the thumb of each lining, 

131
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,992
       then put the lining      
   onto a thumbless hand form.  

132
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,996
   if the hand and thumb forms  
       were in one piece,       

133
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,933
      it would be difficult     
  to remove the stiff pvc glove 

134
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,601
        without tearing.        

135
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,076
     the linings go through     
   what's called the singer --  

136
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,414
 a propane flame that burns off 
   any dust or loose threads.   

137
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,165
  then it's into the pvc bath.  

138
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:32,203
  the basin of liquid pvc moves 
   upward, coating the liners.  

139
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,581
     as the basin descends,     
     the excess drips off.      

140
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,984
  then the gloves go for a spin 

141
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,788
      under infrared lamps      
         for 45 seconds.        

142
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,391
          the spinning          
    spreads the pvc uniformly   

143
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,594
  so that it doesn't accumulate 
   on the tips of the fingers,  

144
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,963
         forming clumps.        

145
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,601
      after a second coat,      

146
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,404
     the gloves pass through    
     a propane-fired furnace    

147
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:11,209
      for about 20 minutes      
   at 370 degrees fahrenheit,   

148
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,613
 then through a cooling chamber 
        for five minutes.       

149
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,149
        for glove models        
     with extra-strong grip,    

150
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,686
       they blow pvc chips      
   onto the first coat of pvc   

151
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,955
      while it's still wet.     

152
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,157
         when the gloves        
     go through the furnace,    

153
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,227
   the heat embeds the chips.   

154
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,497
         after cooling,         
 the gloves are dried and cured 

155
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,500
       and ready to handle      
       a hard day's work.       

156
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,110
            narrator:           
    decorative glass objects    

157
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,046
 can be blown or thermoformed --

158
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,249
       two very different       
     glassmaking techniques.    

159
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,518
        in glass blowing,       
  the artisan shapes hot glass  

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,321
          by rolling it         
    and blowing air into it.    

161
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,124
          thermoforming         
  is more of a molding process, 

162
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,861
          better suited         
    for making flat objects.    

163
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,201
     when you look at these     
       magnificent pieces,      

164
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,673
it's hard to believe they begin 
as run-of-the-mill window glass.

165
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,208
  it comes in ready-made panels 

166
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,946
in thicknesses ranging from 1/10
       to 4/10 of an inch.      

167
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,748
  the first step is to measure  

168
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,017
     the overall dimensions     
       of the glass panel,      

169
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,553
   then divide it into pieces,  

170
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,223
      each slightly larger      
 than the object it will become.

171
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,493
     they'll turn this panel    
  into large decorative plates, 

172
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,962
        so they divide it       
       into three squares,      

173
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,632
      each about 14 inches      
          in diameter.          

174
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,104
     they place each square     
     over a paper pattern.      

175
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,575
using a glass cutter, they score
     the shape of the plate.    

176
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,047
    then they apply pressure    
      with a rubber mallet      

177
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,516
      to separate the glass     
      along the score line.     

178
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,056
    they cut away the excess,   

179
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,359
         breaking it off        
     with a few gentle taps.    

180
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,001
        now they position       
     the plate-shaped glass     

181
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,338
         over a drawing         
     and begin the artwork.     

182
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,774
  first they trace the outline. 

183
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,766
  now they embellish the design 

184
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,035
    and fill in the details.    

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,039
     they use enamel paints     

186
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,143
     specifically designed      
     for painting on glass.     

187
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,983
   once the brushwork's done,   

188
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,518
      they use a paint gun      

189
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,787
 to apply the background colors 
          and shading.          

190
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,190
     the glass has been cut     
         and decorated,         

191
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,124
 but it's still perfectly flat, 

192
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,797
 so the final step is to mold it
       using extreme heat,      

193
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,399
 hence the term "thermoformed." 

194
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,070
    the mold they use is made   
     of fireproof materials     

195
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,473
   designed to withstand high   
  temperatures inside the oven, 

196
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,475
        known as a kiln.        

197
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,146
  they carefully lay the glass  
         over the mold.         

198
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:39,584
   they mold several different  
    pieces at the same time.    

199
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,166
in the intense heat of the kiln,
       the glass will melt      

200
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,768
           and take on          
   the exact shape of the mold  

201
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,573
right down to the most intricate
        textural detail.        

202
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,254
   these small pieces of glass  
   will become the paint pots   

203
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,190
      on this glass replica     
     of an artist's palette.    

204
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,662
   it takes an hour and a half  
    for the kiln temperature    

205
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:29,133
     to climb to a scorching    
    1,550 degrees fahrenheit.   

206
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,139
      at peak temperature,      
   they briefly open the kiln   

207
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,142
  to make sure that everything  
      is progressing well.      

208
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,479
 the glass at this phase should 
   be the consistency of taffy  

209
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,414
     and glowing bright red.    

210
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,883
            if it is,           
     they can close the kiln    

211
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,620
  and begin the cooling phase.  

212
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,155
        six hours later,        

213
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,558
 the glass pieces have hardened 
   into the shape and texture   

214
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,895
    of the respective molds.    

215
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,643
   these plates, spoon rests,   
        and other pieces        

216
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,246
         are cool enough        
    to come out of the kiln.    

217
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,517
the beauty of thermoformed glass

218
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,453
lies in the striking combination
         of transparency        

219
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,522
       and vibrant color.       

220
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,658
           add to that          
the endless shape possibilities,

221
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,328
         and you've got         
      truly functional art.     

222
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,606
  narrator: there are different 
      types of fire trucks.     

223
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,276
     pumpers hook up to fire    
  hydrants, boost the pressure, 

224
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,012
      then shoot water out      
         through hoses.         

225
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,949
          ladder trucks         
      elevate firefighters      

226
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,484
 on either a ladder or platform.

227
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,153
    rescue trucks have tools    
      to cut through metal      

228
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,523
     and clear obstructions.    

229
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,565
       early firefighters       
      couldn't do much more     

230
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,302
   than pass buckets of water   
        from man to man.        

231
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,372
            the 1720s           
    saw the arrival of wagons   

232
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:18,242
      carrying water tanks      
         and hand pumps.        

233
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,778
     those newfangled pumps     
         could spew out         

234
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,581
    an impressive 60 gallons    
     of water per minute --     

235
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,717
      about what you'd get      
     from two garden hoses.     

236
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,987
   the first horse-drawn fire   
 trucks with steam-powered pumps

237
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,257
   went into service in 1852.   

238
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,729
gas-powered trucks replaced them
       in the early 1900s.      

239
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,873
  this pumper truck can deliver 

240
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,410
  almost 1,600 gallons of water 
           per minute.          

241
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,813
  mechanical engineers usually  
    custom-design fire trucks   

242
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,748
  to suit the particular needs  

243
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,685
     of the fire department     
       placing the order.       

244
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,121
    the truck's body is made    

245
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:08,426
   from sheets of marine-grade  
    aluminum 2/10-inch thick.   

246
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,828
            following           
     the technical drawings,    

247
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,432
 workers cut the aluminum panels
     to the sizes required,     

248
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,636
    notching certain corners    
      at a 90-degree angle.     

249
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,307
workers weld the pieces together

250
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,710
      to form what's known      
        as the crew cab.        

251
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,813
  the crew cab not only carries 
        the firefighters,       

252
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,783
it also houses the control panel
      for the water system.     

253
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:42,393
meanwhile, other workers measure
and then cut pieces of aluminum 

254
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,994
      to build the subframe     

255
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,364
 that will support the crew cab 
        from underneath.        

256
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,773
  they weld the parts together. 

257
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,282
      installing the steps,     

258
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,551
       workers leave a gap      
      of about half an inch     

259
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,154
 to enable water to drain down. 

260
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,759
            they line           
    the storage compartments    

261
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,293
      with aluminum sheets,     

262
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,364
 using a sander to make textured
 circles on the smooth surface. 

263
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,833
          this pattern          
  will camouflage the scratches 

264
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,704
that moving equipment in and out
     will inevitably create.    

265
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:30,508
       they use a machine       
      called a press brake      

266
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,045
       to bend the sheets       
     to the required shape.     

267
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,780
    then, using what's known    
        as a punch press,       

268
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,317
         they cut holes         
    for the built-in lights,    

269
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,856
        the door handles,       
 and the various control knobs. 

270
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,725
 workers now assemble the pieces

271
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,994
     and make any necessary     
           adjustments          

272
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,063
        before painting,        
       rather than after,       

273
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,666
  to avoid damaging the finish. 

274
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,069
     after this fine-tuning,    
 they'll disassemble everything 

275
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,339
       and send the parts       
    to the paint department.    

276
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,743
 after that, they'll put it all 
    carefully back together.    

277
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,349
     the full-scale assembly    
         can now begin,         

278
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,950
  starting with the water pump. 

279
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:16,354
   it arrives here ready-made   
       from the supplier.       

280
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,690
    next comes the crew cab.    

281
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,559
 this one isn't for the pumper, 

282
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,662
     but rather for a yellow    
         rescue vehicle.        

283
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,369
       the pipes that lead      
   to and from the water pump   

284
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,305
  go into a threading machine.  

285
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:40,044
  the pipes are part galvanized 
  steel, part stainless steel.  

286
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,583
     once they're threaded,     

287
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:49,220
   they're ready to be screwed  
 into the pump's water outlets. 

288
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,259
       the drive shaft --       

289
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:57,728
         that long piece        
 coming from the transmission --

290
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,531
     performs its usual job     
    of turning the rear axle    

291
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,334
  when the truck is in motion.  

292
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,604
  it also powers the water pump 
    when the truck is parked,   

293
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,439
        fighting a fire.        

294
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,479
 this control box runs the fire 
   truck's electrical system,   

295
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,083
     including the flashing     
        emergency lights.       

296
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,885
    each wire is color-coded,   
          number-coded,         

297
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,388
       and function-coded.      

298
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
      workers run the wires     

299
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,129
   from the box to the control  
     panel in the crew cab.     

300
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,306
 then they hook up the odometer,
          speedometer,          

301
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,142
 and other dashboard indicators.

302
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,981
          they install          
     water-pressure gauges,     

303
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,585
     adapters for connecting    
 the hoses to the water system, 

304
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,723
   and pressure-release valves  
  for adjusting water pressure. 

305
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:02,660
         lo and behold,         
     a shiny, new fire truck    

306
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,796
     built to a department's    
      exact specifications.     

307
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,533
   only there's one thing the   
client didn't have to specify --

308
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,703
       that it be painted       
        fire-engine red.        

309
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,209
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,        

310
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,945
   or if you'd like to suggest  
    topics for future shows,
