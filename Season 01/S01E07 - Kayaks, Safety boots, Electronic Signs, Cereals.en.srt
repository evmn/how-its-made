narrator:
today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:29,861
kayaks -- we'll tip you off
to how they're made.

5
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,564
safety boots --

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,969
we'll walk you through
the manufacturing process.

7
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:42,640
electronic signs --
a sign of the times.

8
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:46,577
and cereal --
we're milking this one big time.

9
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,519
in days gone by,

10
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:57,255
kayaks were made of wood
and animal skin

11
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,324
and used by people
who hunted to survive.

12
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,660
fast-forward to today,

13
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,463
and you'll see that kayaks
have updated their image.

14
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,599
now they're marvels
of molded plastic

15
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:12,570
coveted by sports enthusiasts
far and wide.

16
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,941
a kayak is formed

17
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,743
by the melting of plastic
on a mold of nickel.

18
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,979
this mold is made
in two parts --

19
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,115
an upper and a lower section.

20
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,420
the surface of the mold
is perfectly smooth

21
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,124
and has a mirror finish that
guarantees an excellent luster.

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,764
the graphics are laid on
the mold before molding begins.

23
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,466
this way, they're
well-impregnated in the plastic.

24
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,503
it's an operation that requires
quite a bit of dexterity

25
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,106
because, contrary
to self-adhering stickers,

26
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,241
these graphics
can't be lifted off

27
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,577
if they haven't been
well-positioned.

28
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,379
this is the yellow powder
they're going to melt --

29
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,114
linear polyethylene.

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,049
it comes in several colors.

31
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,718
the amount of powder
to be melted

32
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,688
is determined by the kayak model
to be made.

33
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,861
at the same time,
in other molds,

34
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,664
they're going to fabricate
other parts of the kayak,

35
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,599
such as the baggage
compartment cover,

36
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,268
the central support,
and the seats.

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,871
the polyethylene is poured
into the mold,

38
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,208
which is then closed.

39
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,245
all the other molds
are closed, as well.

40
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,618
before entering the oven,

41
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,688
the molds are securely closed
with clamps

42
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,391
to avoid any loss
of polyethylene.

43
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:46,163
the kayak mold
is put onto a transporter

44
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,099
and placed facing the oven.

45
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,370
because of the large dimensions
of the craft,

46
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,439
the oven had to be custom-made.

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,174
the whole kayak goes in.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,379
the oven is 23 feet long and has
a diameter of about 6 feet.

49
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,716
the polyethylene melts
at 550 degrees.

50
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,659
to completely distribute
the powder throughout the mold,

51
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,661
it pivots on several axes.

52
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,996
it turns on itself

53
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,531
while the oven oscillates
30 degrees

54
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,733
towards the front and rear.

55
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,936
this procedure is termed
"rock 'n' roll"

56
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,239
and lasts 19 minutes.

57
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,544
cooking is now over,
and the mold exits the oven.

58
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,348
but the plastic has to cool
in order to solidify.

59
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,888
to do this, they place the mold
in this cooling chamber.

60
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,226
it must not be cooled
too quickly or it deforms.

61
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,894
a 16-foot kayak

62
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,630
can lose up to 6 inches
of its length.

63
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,206
now the cover of the mold
is lifted off.

64
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:18,923
then they unmold the cover
and the other small parts.

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,928
the kayak is finally unmolded.

66
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,530
now they can proceed
to machining it.

67
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,406
while inspecting the kayak,

68
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,142
they remove any plastic ridges
left by the joint

69
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,410
between the two halves
of the mold.

70
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,213
they now move to finishing.

71
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:45,783
this begins with the screwing on
of carrying handles.

72
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,989
here, they cut the opening
for the baggage compartment.

73
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,028
and then
they install the trimming.

74
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,769
the central support
is positioned.

75
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,370
it plays an important role

76
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,407
because it links the bottom
and top portions of the craft.

77
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,979
all that remains now

78
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,581
is to finish
the baggage compartment.

79
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,718
they attach fasteners,
then put the cover in place

80
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,421
and hold it down
with a retaining strap.

81
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,665
finally, the kayak is packaged,
ready for delivery.

82
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:39,670
this company makes 12 kayak
models of various dimensions.

83
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,613
narrator: here's a lesson

84
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,282
we hope you won't have to learn
the hard way.

85
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,950
drop a hammer on the job,

86
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,222
and you might have a few
broken toes to show for it.

87
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,357
enter the sturdy work boot.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
lace on a pair,

89
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,695
and chances are,
your feet will survive

90
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,431
even your klutziest moments.

91
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,572
work boots are made from cowhide

92
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,707
that has undergone both mineral
and finishing tanning.

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,911
a waterproofing treatment
completes the preparation.

94
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,647
let's follow the process.

95
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,516
this machine is a shaver.

96
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,519
it evens up the hide
and opens its pores

97
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,455
before it receives
other appropriate treatments.

98
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,258
they treat the hides
in this retanning drum.

99
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,328
water, coloring products,
and retanning products

100
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:41,732
are at temperatures
varying from 90 to 180 degrees.

101
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,337
hides are removed
from the retanning drum.

102
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,273
the leather will then
be vacuum-dried for 2 minutes

103
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,942
at a temperature of 160 degrees.

104
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,780
then, the hide will be hung
for 24 to 48 hours.

105
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,185
here, the hide is stretched
on a vacuum-drying plate.

106
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:04,121
it's evened out
to get rid of any creases.

107
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,229
a hide measures
almost 22 square feet.

108
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,698
they'll need about
4 square feet of leather

109
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,366
to make a boot.

110
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,702
they begin cutting
the boot parts.

111
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,371
this punch,
with the help of a press,

112
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,340
cuts the different pieces
of leather.

113
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,313
they also cut
brown fabric pieces --

114
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,248
the interior lining of the boot,

115
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,518
made from a foam base
and woven polyester fibers.

116
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:41,659
this paring machine thins
the edges before they're sewn.

117
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,795
during the cutting,

118
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,365
each piece of leather
is identified by its size.

119
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,539
they now begin assembly
of the boot.

120
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,376
the two sides of the boot are
sewn together on this machine.

121
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,948
now the front part of the boot
is assembled.

122
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,285
excess leather
is progressively cut away.

123
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,288
the eyelets -- made of steel,
brass, or aluminum --

124
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,590
are then positioned.

125
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,294
here, they attach
a foot mount on a form

126
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,864
with tiny nails called tacks.

127
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,301
the last is placed in the boot

128
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,172
to facilitate
the assembly of the front part.

129
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,907
this carding machine

130
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,043
removes any unevenness
at the level of the lining

131
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,380
before proceeding
to the next step.

132
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,650
they now install
the tempered-steel toe cap.

133
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,518
the lining is pulled.

134
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,155
they insert the cap
and fix it well in place.

135
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,730
the leather is folded
beneath the boot,

136
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,798
the bottom secured with a tack,

137
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,067
and the sides fastened
with hot glue

138
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,470
on this seat and side
lasting machine.

139
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,339
the boot front is now finished.

140
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:06,310
we get a good view of
the application of the hot glue.

141
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,083
at this stage,

142
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,286
they remove the last
installed at the beginning.

143
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,922
it's no longer needed.

144
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,893
now the sole will be installed.

145
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,829
the heel core is of pine.

146
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,831
it's put onto the sole,

147
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,166
which will soon be secured
into place.

148
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,103
here, they proceed
with machining

149
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,506
and welding of the rubber sole
to the boot tip.

150
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,508
it's called vulcanization,

151
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,778
done at a temperature
of 330 degrees.

152
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,213
and the sole
is solidly installed.

153
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,453
this machine sands the edges
of the sole

154
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,789
to eliminate
any vulcanization residue.

155
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,125
they also apply a sealant.

156
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:59,096
they now place an insole
inside the boot.

157
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:08,038
here, they install the laces
and stitch on the labels.

158
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,314
the boots now leave
for the packaging area.

159
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,951
building a pair of boots

160
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:25,756
required no less than 123
different fabrication steps,

161
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,090
including packaging.

162
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,828
each pair needs 330 feet
of nylon, cotton,

163
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,563
and polyester threads

164
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:36,100
and over 10 square feet
of thick and rugged leather.

165
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,110
narrator: take a stroll
down tokyo's downtown drag,

166
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,113
and you'll get
the distinct impression

167
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,782
that neon is passé.

168
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:55,586
today, electronic signs
are all the buzz --

169
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,656
futuristic miracles of light,
color, and animation

170
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,727
that make the world
their matinee screen.

171
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,864
digital electronic signboards

172
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,866
are sometimes used
as giant television screens

173
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,468
or to post written messages.

174
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,271
they come in different sizes --
from a few feet

175
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,539
all the way up to many thousands
of square feet.

176
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,209
the creation of a sign
starts with plans

177
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,344
drawn by engineers
and architects.

178
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,680
hundreds of plans
are created by computer,

179
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,215
among other methods,

180
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,485
and require between two days
or even a month of work.

181
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,019
millions of tiny lights,

182
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,689
or light-emitting diodes
called elements,

183
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,424
make up the screen's surface.

184
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,761
these elements are made
of germanium, gallium nitrate,

185
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:40,964
and silicon semiconductors
covered with plastic.

186
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:45,435
these elements have to be placed
so as to form a matrix.

187
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,838
each of the 20 machines
at this plant

188
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:52,375
can install and solder
1,500 elements an hour.

189
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,045
lighting up an element requires
only 10 to 20 milliamps,

190
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,884
and they last
for about 150,000 hours.

191
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,453
all the wires are placed
behind the matrix

192
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,856
in the different
electrical connections.

193
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,258
this conceals everything
behind the sign

194
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,460
and shelters it
from the weather.

195
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,197
depending upon the distance from
which the sign will be seen,

196
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,868
spaces between the elements
vary from 1/10 of an inch

197
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,937
to several inches.

198
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,206
a workman now makes
the electrical connections.

199
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,809
the wires have to be
solidly connected

200
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,246
to resist shaking caused by
movement of the signboard.

201
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,149
the matrices
must operate together

202
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,551
and require controllers,

203
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,487
which send information
from one to the other.

204
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,591
thus, each group controls
its own image.

205
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,095
each matrix has
to be electrically powered

206
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:50,167
and integrated to its own 5-volt
element-illuminating connector.

207
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,175
sometimes the matrices
are made up in two pieces --

208
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,246
one supporting the elements and
the other having the components.

209
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,982
in this case,
it simply requires

210
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,251
two cards to establish
the contact.

211
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,591
now they connect
the information cable

212
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,661
that lights up
and extinguishes the elements.

213
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,663
each matrix
has two connectors --

214
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,865
one that supplies
the electric current

215
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,735
and the other that carries
the sign's information.

216
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:28,805
here, they verify
the functioning of each matrix.

217
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,475
then, they can begin
to join matrices together

218
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,144
to construct the signboard.

219
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,413
we see here
all the colors assembled

220
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,515
as they will be on the screen.

221
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,953
the boards
are sometimes installed outside

222
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,088
and are thus vulnerable
to the weather.

223
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,023
that's why they put on
this rubber strip,

224
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,592
which waterproofs it.

225
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,497
the matrices
are now assembled together.

226
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,004
then, 10 matrices are joined
to make up a module.

227
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,980
at this stage, they insert
the signboard conductor.

228
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,056
then the wires are connected.

229
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,325
these wires transmit
electric current

230
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,961
and all the information
relating to the sign.

231
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,933
the elements require
a very low-voltage current --

232
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,335
about 5 volts.

233
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,937
each module is then provided
with its own converter

234
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,540
to maintain a steady voltage.

235
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,677
then all the modules
are assembled

236
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,279
in the signboard support.

237
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,281
and the many electrical
connections

238
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,416
linking the different modules
are made.

239
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,223
this gigantic signboard

240
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:57,261
is a composition of 35 modules
and 12 matrices.

241
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,501
the signboard
is almost finished.

242
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,770
they now check the color,
the luminosity,

243
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,805
and the resolution
of the screen.

244
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,648
the signboard is made of 120,000
electrical light diodes

245
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,451
and took nearly
3 months of work.

246
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,187
each year,
this company constructs

247
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,256
hundreds of digital signboards

248
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,294
requiring about 100 million
lighting elements.

249
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,005
narrator: if you aren't the type
to rise at the crack of dawn

250
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,675
and wolf down
a hearty breakfast,

251
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,010
chances are you eat a bowl
of cereal

252
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,146
or a granola bar on the fly.

253
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,149
one of the best ways to beat
the early-morning blahs,

254
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,886
the goodness of cereal
now comes in as many forms

255
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,522
as our fast-paced
lifestyles demand.

256
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,098
our breakfast cereals were born
out of the religious beliefs

257
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,766
of the seventh-day adventists.

258
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,367
the seventh-day adventists

259
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,038
are vegetarians who, in 1860,
founded a sanatorium

260
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,307
where patients
were fed only cereals --

261
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,310
wheat flakes invented
by dr. john harvey kellogg.

262
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,447
his brother, william keith,
saw a promising future

263
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,717
and built the first flakes
factory to market the product.

264
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,186
his success
would later be imitated

265
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,321
by the famous
charles william post

266
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,991
of post cereals.

267
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,134
the making of
frosted corn flakes

268
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,736
starts in this cooker.

269
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,241
the corn kernels are cooked here
for 2 hours and 20 minutes.

270
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,380
then the corn kernels
are ground up.

271
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,485
they're ground up
by this endless worm screw.

272
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,454
it also determines
the number of pounds of kernels

273
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,623
needed to make up
a cereal recipe.

274
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:10,494
the ground corn is next dried
in a dryer unit,

275
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,562
an important step
before they're cooked.

276
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,964
to give them
their nice, flat shape,

277
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,767
the corn kernels are crushed
in the flake roller.

278
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,370
two rollers
turn opposite to each other,

279
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,838
and the kernels fall

280
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,307
into the constricted space
between them.

281
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,710
the flakes fall
onto this conveyor,

282
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,113
and the next step
will be cooking.

283
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,387
the flakes arrive
at the cooking oven.

284
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,658
they're shaken to make sure
they will be uniformly browned.

285
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,362
the flakes exit the oven
well-browned.

286
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,732
they then fall into this chute

287
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,068
and head in the direction
of the next step.

288
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,604
this vibrating conveyor
sorts the flakes

289
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,674
and retains
only the right-sized ones.

290
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,342
this drum mixes the flakes

291
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,012
and sprays them
with a sweet solution

292
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:05,348
boiling at 445 degrees.

293
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,951
the sweet solution is dried,

294
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:11,154
and a rake uniformly spreads out
the frosted flakes

295
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,422
on the canvas.

296
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,627
now they add in vitamins.

297
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,097
the cereals are placed
into this rotating drum.

298
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,734
the vitamins are sprayed onto
the flakes by a series of jets.

299
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,240
the cereals are now finished,

300
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,243
and they head
toward the packaging site.

301
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,645
this packager
fills the bags with cereal.

302
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,915
it handles
between 40 and 45 bags a minute

303
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,051
before they head off
for final packaging.

304
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,320
this plant doesn't only
make cereals.

305
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,056
it also makes soft cereal bars.

306
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,457
this kneader
mixes the ingredients --

307
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,894
oat flakes, rice, and syrup.

308
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,330
the preparation is mixed
twice a minute.

309
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,599
when well-mixed,

310
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,334
the preparation is poured
into a large container.

311
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,404
they will now proceed
with the molding of the bars.

312
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,221
the contents of the bin
are emptied onto a conveyor.

313
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,160
and the mixture is spread out.

314
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,467
here, they add chocolate chips
to the mixture.

315
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,706
the mix is compressed
to the desired bar thickness

316
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,308
by this roller.

317
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,913
the bar separator
then divides the mix

318
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,349
into 35 equal strips.

319
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:53,323
and then a guillotine cuts
the bars to their proper length.

320
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,330
the bars continue circulating.

321
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,531
this equipment
is used to line up the bars

322
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,101
and make
the packaging process easier.

323
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,609
side by side,
the bars are turned here

324
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,911
so that they run
one behind the other.

325
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,017
this roller applies a delicious
caramel fondant to the bars.

326
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,690
this caramel fondant
then cools and sets.

327
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:33,897
they're now at
the final stage of production --

328
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,631
coating with chocolate.

329
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,035
about 400 pounds of chocolate
are needed for the bar recipe.

330
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,476
now finished, the bars
are ready for packaging.

331
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,216
this machine
individually bags the bars.

332
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,191
finally, they proceed
with the packaging.

333
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,993
these tasty bars will be
enjoyed by children,

334
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,730
as well as adults.

335
