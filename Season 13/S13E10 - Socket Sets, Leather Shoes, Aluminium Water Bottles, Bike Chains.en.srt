00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,655
narrator: the invention of the socket wrench in 1864  

2
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,323
put a whole new twist on fastening things.      

3
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,060
with the socket wrench's ratchet mechanism,       

4
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,130
the user could tighten bolts in a continuous motion     

5
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,600
without breaking to refit the wrench to the fastener.  

6
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,235
it was a real time-saver.   

7
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,074
modern socket wrenches     

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,878
come with a range of sockets and extensions         

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,281
to handle the nuts and bolts of many different jobs.    

10
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,084
they start with this coil of thick steel.        

11
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,753
it travels through a die which straightens it      

12
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,690
to a knife that slices it into short billets.      

13
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,493
a machine then drives a series of forming tools   

14
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,562
into the billets.       

15
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,967
the tools force them into a socket shape       

16
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,837
and create the all-important hexagonal opening       

17
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:48,174
that matches the profile of the nuts and bolts.     

18
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,112
to get rid of lingering lubricating oil,        

19
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,646
the parts go for a tumble   

20
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,750
through a spiral washer/dryer system.      

21
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,058
a conveyor delivers them to a computerized cutting tool.

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,594
it removes sharp edges     

23
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,929
and sculpts a bevel on the socket's inner rim   

24
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,833
so it will slide onto bolts more easily.          

25
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,938
it takes just seconds to improve
this socket's profile.     

26
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,876
different tools then sculpt the square opening       

27
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,078
in the drive end of the socket.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,348
that's the part that locks onto
the end of the ratchet wrench. 

29
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,419
a powerful rolling stamp    

30
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,756
now engraves the part's size and the company name onto it. 

31
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:39,758
once those details are out of the way,      

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,694
it's into a flaming oven    

33
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:44,630
to undergo a heat-treating process.    

34
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,167
a rapid cooldown follows the heat treatment,  

35
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,869
hardening the metal.      

36
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,040
the sockets now toss about in this rotating chamber    

37
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:59,445
as they're blasted with very fine steel particles.

38
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,715
this cleans the parts and buffs the parts,      

39
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:06,118
but there's much more polishing
to come.            

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,755
they clamp the sockets onto a rotating table.     

41
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,727
it delivers the part to a grinding belt       

42
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:17,930
for a very vigorous polishing. 

43
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,332
you can see the difference this makes   

44
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,934
in the part on the right,   

45
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,004
but these sockets need to be absolutely flawless.      

46
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:28,541
so they next go into a tub of ceramic stones.       

47
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,876
they rub mild acid onto the parts         

48
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,379
to get rid of any small blemishes that remain.     

49
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:39,151
the parts then receive a thorough wash and rinse,   

50
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,587
which prepares them for chrome plating.      

51
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,291
now freshly chromed,      

52
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,294
the sockets look way too nice 

53
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,896
to be immersed in this brownish stuff,    

54
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,166
but it's actually a rustproofing solution    

55
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,368
to protect them from corrosion.

56
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,704
they lock the tub of sockets in a centrifuge machine.    

57
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,906
it spins the parts       

58
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,743
to get rid of the excess rustproofing liquid.      

59
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,383
and now these sockets are ready to shine on the job. 

60
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:15,387
attachable extensions improve the reach of the socket wrench.

61
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,057
forming equipment swings into action,      

62
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,392
pressing steel billets into dies           

63
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,829
to mold them into the rough shape of an extension.     

64
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,802
after a wash and dry, it's over to a lathe.     

65
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,470
and as the extension spins,  

66
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,206
cutting tools create the squared opening       

67
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,143
that allows it to be attached to the wrench.         

68
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,615
cutters then go to work on the other end.       

69
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,752
they shape it so it will fit into various sockets      

70
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,321
and shave the shank to reduce its diameter.    

71
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,031
next, a rolling stamp cuts a knurled texture       

72
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,899
into the socket-wrench extension,           

73
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,736
creating a much less slippery surface to hang on to.     

74
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,176
they insert a stainless-steel spring    

75
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:13,846
into a hole formed at the end of the extension...      

76
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,381
then scoop up a steel ball   

77
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,718
so it sits in the cavity above the spring.       

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,921
a machine then press-fits it to the extension.       

79
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,859
this creates a mechanism onto which the sockets attach. 

80
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,598
it takes about three days to complete this socket set,  

81
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,868
but it will equip you to handle jobs of many sizes  

82
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,871
and just about any tight situation.      

83
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,623
narrator: if you're a lover of fine footwear,       

84
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,959
when it comes to dressing your feet,           

85
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,360
nothing beats leather     

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,630
because, unlike synthetic materials,  

87
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,798
leather lets your feet breathe.

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,569
and high-end leather shoes feature superior construction 

89
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:14,106
that makes them lightweight and comfortable to wear.    

90
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,180
the vision originates     

91
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:24,850
with a design sketched on a flexible plastic sheet.  

92
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,786
to help the stylist perfect the design,      

93
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:32,524
they put it on a rigid foot form
called a last.         

94
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,794
exotic skins have natural variations throughout, 

95
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:39,131
so a specialist must hand-cut the pattern pieces       

96
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,134
to ensure the right and left shoes match well.       

97
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,139
they use a splitting machine  

98
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,475
to shave off a layer from the underside,       

99
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:52,878
equalizing the thickness of all the pieces.       

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,748
then a skiving machine thins the edges        

101
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,217
so the pieces will be easier to sew together.        

102
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,154
they punch decorative holes into certain pieces      

103
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,422
with a manual press,      

104
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,890
so it's up to the operator   

105
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,760
to make sure the distance between holes is consistent.  

106
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,165
the top of the shoe is called the upper.      

107
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,233
they sew together the upper pieces,       

108
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:20,305
then hammer the stitches to make
the seam smooth and flat.   

109
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,641
next they glue a narrow leather strip     

110
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,309
along the border of the upper 

111
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,645
to hide the leather's unfinished edge.        

112
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,081
this also produces a decorative trim.       

113
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,857
now they attach a lining made of goat leather and flax.   

114
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,526
this style of lining fits snugly over the last,   

115
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,528
a particular type of construction        

116
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,298
that allows for a more comfortable type of insole.  

117
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,669
they put the lining inside the upper        

118
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:54,339
and slip them onto the last.  

119
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,542
then they glue on the insole. 

120
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,344
this type consists of a rigid section --     

121
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,079
the black part --       

122
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,615
and a more flexible section -- the white part.        

123
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,287
now they glue the lining to the upper          

124
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,956
and put the front of the shoe, called the point,       

125
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,026
into a machine that grips the edge of the leather    

126
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,394
and pulls it straight.     

127
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,437
the next machine's mechanical fingers       

128
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,573
wrap the edge underneath and glue it,          

129
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:31,610
pulling evenly all around so that everything's symmetrical. 

130
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,786
the next machine does the same thing at the back of the shoe. 

131
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,597
they grind down the leather edge,       

132
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:55,467
creating a flat, even surface that's ready for the sole.   

133
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,803
next they heat the leather to make it malleable      

134
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,072
and hammer until the upper        

135
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,341
assumes the shape of the last inside.      

136
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:05,010
the hammering also rids the leather of any wrinkles.  

137
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,618
they coat the underside with glue           

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,755
and carefully position the shoe's leather sole.    

139
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,625
the glue takes about 10 minutes
to dry.            

140
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,164
then they run the edge of the sole          

141
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,101
through a splitting machine.  

142
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:34,439
this separates a thin layer  
which they now sew to the upper.

143
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,509
durable twine and a heavy-duty loop stitch  

144
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,712
ensure the upper and sole remain inseparable.      

145
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,226
to hide the stitching, they glue
and grind down the edge.    

146
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:10,943
a thorough polishing gives   
the sole a slick-looking finish.

147
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,351
every pair of shoes this factory produces     

148
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,086
is polished by a specialist,  

149
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,355
who creates just the right shading     

150
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,958
to bring out the leather's best features.         

151
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,763
this is the last step     
of roughly 200 manual operations

152
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,365
that go into producing just a single pair       

153
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,502
of these luxurious leather shoes.    

154
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,792
narrator: it was swiss hikers      

155
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,261
who carried the first aluminum drink bottles     

156
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,530
in the early part of the 20th century.      

157
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,601
today's lightweight bottles can be reused endlessly,    

158
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,137
meaning less waste in landfills.

159
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,273
they can also be recycled,   

160
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:17,009
so making one is not a wasted effort.    

161
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,284
some of those first trailblazing
bottles still survive today,  

162
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,421
reminding us that this kind of container is made to last. 

163
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,896
today's bottle starts with an aluminum puck     

164
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,565
2 3/4 inches in diameter.   

165
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:47,039
the puck travels down a chute into a punch press.      

166
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,241
it uses 660 tons of force   

167
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,842
to stretch that little puck  

168
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:55,180
into a long cylinder with a bottom.         

169
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,984
a blade chops the open end down to the correct size,    

170
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,520
and then a tool pushes it onto a conveyor        

171
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:05,057
that sends it down the line.  

172
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,463
the aluminum cylinder lands on a wheel        

173
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,199
which relays it to the next station.      

174
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,469
there, machinery moves the cylinder's open end    

175
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,071
into position for tools    

176
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:22,407
to squeeze it into a bottleneck.       

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,477
the tools pinch the metal a total of 26 times      

178
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,015
to draw the open end down to half its original diameter. 

179
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,350
this gentle forming process  

180
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:34,486
results in less stress on the metal.         

181
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:44,162
the last tool presses a threaded ring    

182
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,165
into the inside of the bottle for screwing on the cap.    

183
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,903
the process leaves the threaded neck        

184
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,572
a lot thicker than the rest of the bottle         

185
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,908
so it will hold up to heavy usage.        

186
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:03,181
now the bottles head into a wash station.      

187
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,582
they get a really good scrubbing

188
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,119
to remove the lubricating oil from the forming process.   

189
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,993
they then travel through a dryer,        

190
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,728
and after a few minutes,    

191
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,365
they emerge clean and ready for the next operation.    

192
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,876
the interior wall of the aluminum drink bottle  

193
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:34,279
is about to be lined with a microthin, high-tech polymer.

194
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,485
this revolving device picks up each bottle using suction   

195
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,921
and delivers it to an individual sprayer.   

196
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,493
the spray nozzle coats the inside of this container  

197
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,162
with a polymer.        

198
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,034
the liner has been specially formulated      

199
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,702
to be chemically inert,    

200
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,840
which means it won't absorb or transfer flavors.      

201
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,176
at this point, the coating is powdery,    

202
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,912
and you could wipe it off with your finger,       

203
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,914
but that's just temporary.   

204
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,049
as they bake it, the powder will solidify    

205
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,287
and bond completely to the inside of the bottle.  

206
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,858
the bottles move through an oven      

207
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,461
that's heated to 356 degrees fahrenheit   

208
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,296
for 10 minutes.        

209
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,535
the liner doesn't add much weight to the bottle.   

210
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,671
here they weigh one before lining and after,    

211
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,174
and the difference is just a few grams.      

212
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,414
now the bottles spin by a gauntlet of spray guns  

213
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,149
for an even coat of paint.   

214
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,951
like the inner liner,     

215
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:50,021
this outer veneer will need to be baked on.   

216
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,291
when it dries, the paint takes on a glossy look.     

217
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,095
an automated squeegee     

218
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,765
silk-screens designs onto the bottles.       

219
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,241
a jet of air dries the ink between printings       

220
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,777
as they build up the artwork using different colors.    

221
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,519
and now it's time to screw on the cap.      

222
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,454
as she caps the bottle,    

223
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,691
this worker performs a final inspection of the product.   

224
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,533
from a small aluminum puck to a handy drink bottle --   

225
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:39,070
incredibly, this transformation
has taken just three hours.  

226
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,273
and in its various styles,   

227
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:45,977
this reusable bottle is sure to make a lasting impression. 

228
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,962
narrator: pedaling a bicycle causes a chain reaction    

229
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,697
that sets wheels in motion.  

230
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,568
a bicycle chain is essentially a roller chain. 

231
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,570
it's designed specifically to transfer pedal power    

232
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,773
to the bicycle's rear drive wheel.       

233
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,242
with a good bicycle chain, you can go far         

234
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,643
or, at the very least,     

235
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,612
take a short spin around the hood.        

236
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,453
the chain is the driving force 

237
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,056
in a bicycle's transmission system.      

238
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,791
it travels over gears in a perpetual loop      

239
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,261
to keep the cyclist moving forward.        

240
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:40,265
actions like shifting gears or braking           

241
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,368
will regularly put this critical mechanism to the test.

242
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,876
it all starts with this punch press.     

243
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,878
it cuts and presses steel   

244
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,414
into the shape of the chain's inner links,  

245
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,850
which looks a lot like a figure eight.      

246
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,293
incredibly, it generates 10,000 links per hour.     

247
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,036
each of these figure-eight links
has been made to interconnect, 

248
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,771
and their contours allow them 

249
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,641
to travel easily across the bike's gear sprockets.   

250
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,249
they send samples of the links to a measuring station     

251
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,452
to confirm the space between the holes       

252
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,289
is precisely 12.7 millimeters. 

253
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:43,060
the tester also gauges the diameter of the holes,   

254
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,665
which must be accurate to within
a fraction of a millimeter.  

255
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,534
then the links bake in an oven 

256
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,471
at more than 1,500 degrees fahrenheit. 

257
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,408
the blazing heat, followed by a quick cooldown, 

258
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,109
hardens the steel.       

259
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,747
they now shovel these inner links       

260
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,416
into a doughnut-shaped machine.

261
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,357
they add ceramic and silica powders...     

262
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,494
and pour in a small amount of water.    

263
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,497
they then screw the lid on this machine.        

264
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,500
it shakes vigorously,     

265
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,570
causing the powders and water to form an abrasive paste   

266
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,440
that polishes the links.    

267
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,375
they load the polished inner links into a metal basket

268
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,244
and shut the door.       

269
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,852
machinery plunges the basket into a series of chemical baths

270
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:46,324
to give these inner links a nickel-teflon veneer.    

271
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,194
the nickel-teflon surface will resist corrosion,     

272
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,130
and its smooth texture will allow the chain      

273
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,899
to travel easily over gear sprockets.      

274
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,407
the bike chain's outer links get a different kind of finish.

275
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,875
unlike the inner links,    

276
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,077
they don't travel over sprockets,        

277
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,580
so a simple nickel plating will do.            

278
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,351
they're now ready to assemble the chain     

279
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,954
one section at a time.     

280
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:24,696
tubes feed the parts one by one
into this assembly machine.  

281
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,365
gripper arms adjust their position     

282
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,834
to assemble the links to other chain components,   

283
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,004
such as retainer rings and spacers.          

284
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,111
the machinery presses pins into the links' holes     

285
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:43,648
to secure the assembly.    

286
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,852
then grippers move the completed
section of chain down the line. 

287
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,789
it takes a whole lot of little pieces        

288
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,592
to build one short section of bicycle chain.       

289
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,931
the sections are linked together
in one long chain,       

290
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,401
which now winds by an inspection station    

291
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,537
to be examined for flaws.   

292
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,544
after that, the chain takes a dip in hot oil,       

293
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,212
which lubricates the links   

294
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:19,117
to prevent squeakiness and wear down the road.    

295
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,619
the chain exits the lubricating station    

296
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,155
and travels by wads of absorbent material,     

297
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,257
which soaks up the excess grease.       

298
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,497
a laser tool then signals   

299
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,766
the location where the chain is to be cut,         

300
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:39,236
and a blade chops it at the exact spot.       

301
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,575
a standard bike chain is just over 56 inches in length.
