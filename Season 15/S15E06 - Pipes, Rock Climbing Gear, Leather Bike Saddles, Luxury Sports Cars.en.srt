      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:54,720
            narrator:           
    when christopher columbus   
    discovered the americas,    

4
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,422
       he also discovered       
       the tobacco pipe.        

5
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,259
 the pipe was an important part 
        of native culture       

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:04,129
    to be shared during times   
 of negotiation and celebration.

7
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,266
  columbus and other explorers  
    brought the concept home,   

8
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,101
    and the rest is history.    

9
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,809
     since the 19th century,    
pipes have been made from briar,

10
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,944
   a hard, fire-resistant wood  

11
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,847
from the root of a mediterranean
         heather shrub.         

12
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,687
         after the briar        
  has cured for several months, 

13
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,723
     the pipe-maker saws it     
    into a rough pipe shape.    

14
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:35,361
   using a lathe and chisel,    
   he rounds the larger block   

15
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,863
    to approximate the shape    
        of the pipe bowl.       

16
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,568
   he bores through the center  

17
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,704
          to carve out          
      the tobacco chamber.      

18
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
  then he slims down the stem,  

19
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,784
       marking the center       
       for drilling later.      

20
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,887
    the pipe-maker finalizes    
       the shape by hand.       

21
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:08,160
  he now sands both the inside  
    of the tobacco chamber...   

22
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,934
       ...and the outside       
       of the pipe bowl.        

23
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,607
   next, the pipe's mouthpiece  
          takes shape.          

24
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,076
 the pipe-maker pierces a piece 
       of hardened rubber       

25
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,745
        called vulcanite        
     to establish the center    

26
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,614
         and then drills        
      a channel through it.     

27
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,750
       using a grindstone,      
       he sculpts one end,      

28
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,552
  taking it from round to oval, 

29
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,287
        a shape that fits       
        more comfortably        

30
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,189
        between the lips.       

31
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,562
       he checks his work       
    with a sizing template...   

32
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,164
    then shaves the exterior    
       of the mouthpiece,       

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,767
    reducing it considerably.   

34
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,238
     he shapes the other end    
       to form the tenon,       

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,973
 which fits into the pipe stem. 

36
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,244
      he polishes the tenon     
    with a special compound.    

37
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:01,313
      the smoother surface      
     makes this part easier     

38
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,449
    to join to the pipe stem.   

39
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,588
 using a series of sanding disks
 with progressively finer grit, 

40
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,160
    he gives the exterior of    
 the mouthpiece a sleek finish. 

41
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,798
 then he steadies it in a clamp 

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
       and widens the hole      
 in the center of the mouthpiece

43
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:26,105
          to broaden it         
  into a funnel-shaped cavity.  

44
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,278
 attention now turns to the seam

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,347
       between the rubber       
         and wood parts.        

46
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,950
    he sands it to make them    
        perfectly flush.        

47
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,756
  hand-filing removes blemishes 

48
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,492
    and adjusts the thickness   
  for a more comfortable bite.  

49
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:50,629
 the thickness can be customized
   for individual preferences.  

50
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:54,233
   he drills a tiny hole into   
  the top of the mouthpiece...  

51
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,706
          ...then dips          
   a thin plastic rod in glue   

52
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,075
   and inserts it in the hole.  

53
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,182
        he sands it down,       
      leaving a white spot,     

54
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:14,186
     a marker that indicates    
the mouthpiece is right-side-up.

55
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,122
    for bent or curved pipes,   

56
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:21,726
the mouthpieces are heated in an
oven at 320 degrees fahrenheit. 

57
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,595
    this makes the vulcanite    
         flexible enough        

58
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,798
      to be shaped by hand.     

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,401
    the pipe-maker bends the    
mouthpiece to the desired shape,

60
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,338
 and a quick cool-down in water 
    re-hardens the vulcanite,   

61
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,306
        fixing its curve.       

62
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,813
 next, he buffs the wooden part 
          of the pipe.          

63
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,884
   this removes fine scratches  
 and brings out the wood grain. 

64
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,954
     it also gives the wood     
        a glossy finish.        

65
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,691
   but for a different finish,  

66
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,160
     a craftsman sand-blasts    
         the briar wood,        

67
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,296
   giving it a ripple texture.  

68
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,900
       he stains it darker      
   with an alcohol-based dye,   

69
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,736
        working the stain       
       into every crevice.      

70
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,107
    and now for a neat trick.   

71
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,709
       he sets it on fire,      

72
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,511
    and the alcohol burns off   
        to set the stain.       

73
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,480
     the pipe doesn't go up     
           in flames,           

74
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,317
       proving it's truly       
         fire-resistant.        

75
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,253
    he burns up to 10 layers    
    of stain into the pipe,     

76
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,323
     depending on the effect    
     he's trying to achieve.    

77
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,458
            finally,            
   he stamps the company name   

78
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,727
      and other information     
         into the pipe.         

79
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,332
          after a final         
       quality inspection,      

80
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,334
   this handcrafted briar pipe  

81
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:39,071
     is on its way to making    
a statement at the country club.

82
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,756
 narrator: rock-climbing is no  
 pastime for the faint-hearted. 

83
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,627
 scaling natural rock formations
      or manmade rock walls     

84
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,629
requires a certain fearlessness,

85
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,631
         along with good        
     physical conditioning,     

86
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,232
        balance, agility,       

87
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,834
  and you must be well-trained  
     in climbing techniques     

88
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,838
 and use specialized equipment. 

89
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,442
 climbers usually work in pairs,

90
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,811
     using a system of ropes    
        and other devices       

91
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,512
   to catch them if they fall.  

92
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:24,182
   a key piece of gear is the   
  spring-loaded camming device. 

93
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:27,019
  the climber pulls the trigger 
      to contract the cams      

94
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,654
   and position it in a crack   

95
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,723
    then releases the trigger   
       to expand the cams,      

96
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,326
  which securely grip the rock  
         on either side,        

97
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:38,797
  then attaches a rope through  
  a device called a carabiner.  

98
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:43,002
    climbers typically carry    
several types and sizes of cams,

99
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:46,671
 carabiners, and other devices. 

100
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,541
      the equipment must be     
   as lightweight as possible,  

101
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,076
     yet, at the same time,     

102
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,146
          strong enough         
   to save a falling climber.   

103
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:58,417
 which is why this manufacturer 
 uses aircraft-grade aluminum.  

104
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,619
       to make carabiners,      

105
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,757
automated saws cut aluminum bars
into pieces the required length.

106
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,761
     then a bending machine     
 forces each piece around a form

107
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,230
       in the basic shape       
       of the carabiner.        

108
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,103
         carabiners come        
  in various sizes and shapes.  

109
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,640
    workers simply mount the    
appropriate form on the machine.

110
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,047
  next, they place the roughly  
formed carabiner onto a hot die.

111
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:33,652
  another die slams down on it  
  with up to 800 tons of force, 

112
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,121
    forging the final shape.    

113
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,524
   then the most critical part  
 of the manufacturing process --

114
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,393
  a multi-phase heat treatment  

115
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,930
    to harden and strengthen    
          the aluminum.         

116
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,999
 next, they use a clipping press

117
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,002
    to slice off excess metal   
      along the perimeter.      

118
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,669
    this leaves rough edges,    

119
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,273
   which they now smooth out    
   using an abrasion process.   

120
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,010
         the carabiners         
    go into a vibrating tub,    

121
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:03,148
where they rub against porcelain
  chips for the next 20 hours.  

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,951
    next, workers drill holes   
         for the rivets         

123
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,655
   on which the spring-loaded   
  opening mechanism will hinge. 

124
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,891
that mechanism, called the gate,

125
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,227
          has channels          
  which align with these holes. 

126
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,965
  assemblers slide a spring and 
  spring-pusher into the gate,  

127
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,835
 then insert the rivets through 
 the aligned holes and channels.

128
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,771
       a riveting machine       
    locks each rivet in place   

129
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,575
           by rounding          
     and widening the head.     

130
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,111
        then they adjust        
      the carabiner's frame     

131
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,579
 until the alignment is perfect.

132
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,116
  after a thorough inspection,  

133
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:40,386
     a laser etching machine    
  inscribes product information 

134
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:42,988
   and a unique serial number.  

135
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,860
random samples undergo strength 
and other quality-control tests.

136
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,930
    elsewhere in the factory,   

137
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,400
    camming device production   
          is under way.         

138
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:57,870
    computer-guided equipment   
machines the same aluminum alloy

139
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,938
     to a preliminary shape,    

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,406
        saws off slices,        

141
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,676
    then machines each slice    
  to the final shape of a cam.  

142
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,615
  an assembler attaches a wire  
         to each cam...         

143
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,619
      then takes four cams      
      and joins their wires     

144
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,588
      to the trigger wires      
      with a metal crimp.       

145
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,631
    the cams, by this point,    
      are different colors.     

146
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,967
that's because they've undergone
       chemical treatment       

147
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,370
          to make them          
      corrosion-resistant.      

148
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,773
   this process can, in fact,   
     produce various colors.    

149
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,108
      so, at the same time,     

150
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,378
   the company can color-code   
      the different models.     

151
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,647
     as assembly continues,     
      they thread the cams      

152
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,918
   onto an axle-like component  
       called the spindle,      

153
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,389
      positioning a spring      
      in between each cam.      

154
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:53,124
       the springs provide      
     the resistance required    

155
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,594
      to expand and retract     
           the device.          

156
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,337
      a cone-shaped washer      
   on each end of the spindle   

157
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,139
   holds everything together.   

158
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,878
 this time, the riveting machine
     locks in the components    

159
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,881
   by flattening and widening   
     the end of the spindle     

160
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,050
 to fill the hole in the washer.

161
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:24,589
           with that,           
 the camming device is finished.

162
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,891
  this is how camming devices,  
           carabiners,          

163
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,228
     and other climbing gear    
        all work together       

164
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,264
        to catch climbers       
    who lose their foothold.    

165
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,569
      not only do they keep     
        the climber safe,       

166
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,171
    they also protect nature,   

167
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:41,072
       because they attach      
        to the rock face        

168
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,342
 without damaging it in any way.

169
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,391
            narrator:           
      leather bike saddles      

170
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,594
      feature a leather top     
   suspended on a metal frame.  

171
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,664
       with time and use,       
    the leather molds itself    

172
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,865
        to perfectly suit       
       the rider's anatomy      

173
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,801
    and their cycling style.    

174
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,604
      and just like a pair      
        of leather shoes,       

175
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,907
       the saddle becomes       
       very comfortable.        

176
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,011
      leather bike saddles      
      look almost the same      

177
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,348
   as they did 100 years ago.   

178
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,216
   they are still made by hand  

179
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,021
  and by some machinery that is 
  sometimes over 60 years old.  

180
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,693
  saddles are made exclusively  
      of metal and leather,     

181
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,694
      traditional materials     
           that retain          

182
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,964
      the style and quality     
       of the early days.       

183
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,837
    the first step is making    
     the steel wire springs     

184
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,306
           for saddles          
     that have a suspension.    

185
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,776
   the machine coils and cuts   
 the wire to the proper length. 

186
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,714
     liquid lubricant keeps     
  everything running smoothly.  

187
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,484
depending on the saddle's model,
 some springs are then chromed. 

188
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,790
  this machine folds and curls  
     steel or titanium wire     

189
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,960
        to form brackets.       

190
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,663
        it's adjustable,        

191
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,600
     so it can make brackets    
 of different sizes and shapes, 

192
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:17,069
     depending on the model     
         being produced.        

193
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,280
     a technician assembles     
    the springs and brackets    

194
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:31,316
   to form the saddle's frame.  

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,165
      he attaches the clamp     
       so that the saddle       

196
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,202
         can be attached        
   to the bicycle's seat post.  

197
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,320
 saddles come in different sizes
           and shapes,          

198
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,189
         with or without        
       suspension springs       

199
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:14,192
         to accommodate         
    various riding styles --    

200
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,663
    racing, mountain biking,    
       or city commuting.       

201
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,402
      now for the saddle's      
          leather top.          

202
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,737
        using a hydraulic       
         clicking press,        

203
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,807
   the worker cuts the leather  
       with a sharp blade.      

204
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,212
the blade cuts ventilation holes
        at the same time.       

205
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:42,187
tanneries provide leather in any
 color required by the factory. 

206
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,758
     after the tops are cut,    

207
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,161
    they soak in tepid water    
   for 20 minutes to an hour,   

208
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,931
        until the leather       
    is completely saturated.    

209
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,972
       the wet leather top      
      then goes to a press,     

210
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,909
   which applies 2,000 pounds   
  of pressure per square inch.  

211
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,711
    using a leather cushion,    

212
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,579
       the technician pads      
        the leather piece       

213
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,382
  to help reinforce the shape,  

214
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:12,517
           especially           
    in the narrow front end.    

215
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,519
     because the top is wet,    

216
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,123
      it retains the shape      
    and does not bounce back.   

217
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,526
 they carefully sand the leather
      to get a smooth edge.     

218
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,199
  the tops now go into the oven 
         for three hours        

219
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:32,070
    at a maximum temperature    
   of 130 degrees fahrenheit.   

220
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,542
        now they're ready       
   for the finishing process.   

221
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,215
  a worker rivets a name plate  
  to the rear of the saddle...  

222
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,422
   ...then stamps a trademark   
          on each side.         

223
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,964
        each saddle model       
     has its own trademark.     

224
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,170
      they attach the nose      
   to the front of the saddle   

225
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,572
   using solid copper rivets.   

226
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,041
    they hammer each one down   
            carefully           

227
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:14,112
 to follow the contours of the  
 leather without scratching it. 

228
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,216
   this machine now rivets the  
frame to the back of the saddle.

229
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:28,860
    they insert a tension pin   
 between the frame and the nose.

230
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,197
  this pin will allow the rider 
      to adjust his saddle      

231
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,934
  if the leather starts sagging 
       after a few years.       

232
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,006
    it takes about three days   
 to make a leather bike saddle. 

233
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,807
     and with careful care,     

234
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,043
         it can be used         
       for years to come.       

235
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,359
            narrator:           
       luxury sports cars       

236
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,628
      are coveted by people     
        around the world,       

237
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,163
      and with good reason.     

238
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,566
    the extraordinary skills    
          and materials         

239
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:09,033
    that go into making them    

240
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,636
         were developed         
  from a long racing heritage.  

241
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,237
  each one of these automobiles 

242
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,440
             is born            
    from expert craftsmanship   

243
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,375
    and a passion for racing.   

244
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,715
    underneath the beautiful    
     exterior of these cars     

245
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,184
  lie a chassis and power train 

246
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,421
      capable of delivering     
     remarkable performance.    

247
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:38,930
the aluminum frame is engineered
  to be lightweight, yet rigid, 

248
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,332
    and provide crumple zones   

249
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:44,402
that can evenly distribute force
   in the event of an impact.   

250
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,538
     it takes highly skilled    
           technicians          

251
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,874
 to perform these complex welds.

252
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:56,348
      on the factory floor,     
robots transport the body panels

253
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,917
    that will later be fitted   
        onto the chassis.       

254
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,290
  once the frame is completed,  

255
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,292
         technicians use        
        a pneumatic hoist       

256
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:11,295
     to position and attach     
   exterior panels and doors.   

257
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,032
       door panel cutouts       
     reduce the car's weight    

258
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,368
  while retaining a high degree 
    of structural integrity.    

259
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,638
      the elongated cutouts     
          on this model         

260
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,173
           will house           
    its stylized headlights.    

261
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,776
     next, they coat the car    
          in a compound         

262
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,579
        which fluoresces        
under a special lighting system.

263
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:32,516
  this helps technicians detect 
    any minute imperfections.   

264
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,887
       these imperfections      
  are then filed down by hand.  

265
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:43,128
  here, a robot fully immerses  
     and rotates the chassis    

266
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,398
    in a galvanizing solution   
    that prevents corrosion.    

267
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,466
 once the body has been primed, 

268
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,803
   it passes through a device   
 that dusts off the entire body 

269
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,806
  with ostrich-feather brushes. 

270
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,743
   next stop, the paint room,   
 where robots spray the car body

271
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,179
         with a smooth,         
       even coat of paint.      

272
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,884
 once the paint dries and cures,

273
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:08,886
 the robots apply several coats 
           of varnish.          

274
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:13,558
   the final step in body prep  
 is a meticulous waxing by hand 

275
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,227
            to remove           
    any remaining blemishes.    

276
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,301
    moving on to the chassis,   
    a technician uses a hoist   

277
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,339
     to position and fasten     
the engine and gearbox in place.

278
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,511
     here, robots transport     
    the completed power train   

279
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,447
     to the assembly area...    

280
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,383
    where an automatic crane    

281
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,319
   gently lowers the car body   
        onto the chassis,       

282
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,521
         which includes         
 the fully assembled suspension,

283
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,790
      gearbox, and engine.      

284
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,159
       this step is known       
        as the marriage.        

285
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,397
         next, a worker         
       installs the wheels      

286
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,401
         with some help         
from a hydraulic lifting system.

287
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,144
      at the next station,      

288
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,280
        technicians test        
  all the dashboard components. 

289
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,349
      this vehicle features     
          a combination         

290
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,852
 of analog and digital displays.

291
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,558
        a master computer       

292
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,328
      runs the electronics      
    and information systems.    

293
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,599
       again with the help      
          of the crane,         

294
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,269
       technicians install      
     the finished dashboard.    

295
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,518
          the next step         
     is the steering wheel.     

296
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,788
            assisted            
   by a special assembly jig,   

297
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,389
     a technician positions     

298
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,825
         and tightens it        
    onto the steering column.   

299
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,201
  workers lower the trunk cover 

300
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,804
     and convertible hardtop    
         into position,         

301
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,807
       which is particular      
      to this model of car.     

302
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,882
     a worker double-checks     
        the installation        

303
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,984
   of the hydraulic mechanism.  

304
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,688
   this beautiful road machine  

305
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,425
       is the culmination       
   of years of racing history,  

306
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:31,129
       modern engineering,      
  and dedicated craftsmanship.  

307
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,302
         now watch this.        

308
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,839
   this is one of the few cars  

309
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,310
 that features a fully automated
      convertible hardtop.      

310
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:49,447
    this beauty is now ready    
       for the sun, wind,       

311
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,382
       and the open road.       

312
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,461
