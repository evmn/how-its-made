            narrator:           
    in the world of plumbing,   
   it's all about connections.  

4
00:00:56,391 --> 00:01:00,059
 and we're talking about elbows,
    t's, and other fittings.    

5
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,328
            fittings            
    hold everything together.   

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,663
        they're also used       
        to reroute pipes        

7
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,799
           and control          
      the flow of liquids.      

8
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,970
    without them, things just   
  wouldn't flow as they should. 

9
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,610
  with so many shapes and sizes 
         to choose from,        

10
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,214
 today's pipe fittings literally
  have all the angles covered.  

11
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,550
           they start           
     with sheets of copper.     

12
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:30,956
  this copper has been refined  
     until it's 99.99% pure.    

13
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,692
      they load the sheets      
         into a furnace         

14
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,297
    that's fired at just over   
    1,800 degrees fahrenheit.   

15
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,100
        the copper melts        
     into a piping hot soup     

16
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,168
         and then flows         
     into a second furnace.     

17
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,638
 this one has cylindrical molds 

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,307
 which draw the liquid copper up
           and cool it          

19
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,677
        as they shape it        
     into solid copper rods.    

20
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:58,050
 these rods are flexible enough 
     to wind through rollers    

21
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,521
         as they travel         
     towards a big spindle.     

22
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,523
 they spiral around the spindle,

23
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,728
    accumulating in big coils   
     to await the next step.    

24
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,601
 this device uncoils the copper 

25
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:19,472
and chops it into little pucks  
about the diameter of a quarter.

26
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,875
           incredibly,          
     each one of these pucks    

27
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:26,412
          will be used          
   to make a plumbing fitting.  

28
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:29,815
this tool pushes the copper puck
     into a cylindrical die     

29
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,283
    to shape it into tubing.    

30
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,355
    in this one swift action,   
      a little copper puck      

31
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,258
       is transformed into      
  a much longer piece of pipe.  

32
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:45,631
 this copper has been reshaped  
 as easily as a piece of putty. 

33
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,567
       one end is closed,       
    but it's just temporary.    

34
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,638
 at the next station, equipment 
 bends the tubing around forms  

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,439
   to give it an elbow shape.   

36
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:58,811
 at the same time, a blade cuts 
 the closed end to open it up.  

37
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,049
       next, these elbows       
   will get some fine-tuning.   

38
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,852
 a 2-part device comes together 
         to steady them         

39
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,254
            as tools            
  stretch the internal diameter 

40
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,425
           so the part          
    will fit on other pipes.    

41
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,796
  a spinning cutter then carves 
      bevels onto the rims.     

42
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:21,200
 this beveled edge will allow it
      to slide more easily      

43
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,969
        onto other pipes        
      during installation.      

44
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,215
    over at the next furnace,   

45
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,885
         they're working        
   on a larger-scale project.   

46
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,489
 this molten copper will be used
 to make fittings for high-rises

47
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,092
       and other buildings      
  with bigger plumbing systems. 

48
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,894
        the copper flows        
     into a casting furnace.    

49
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,830
    it generates copper rods    

50
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:54,100
     that are about the size    
      of a telephone pole.      

51
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:55,901
  each one weighs about a ton,  

52
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,104
 so it takes a crane to move it 
    down the production line.   

53
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,907
         a circular saw         
      then carves them up,      

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,778
     producing copper chunks    
 that look a bit like firewood. 

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,783
    they heat each chunk in a   
furnace to make it more pliable.

56
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,918
   then it's into an extruder.  

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,587
             it uses            
   tons of hydraulic pressure   

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,656
  to hollow out the copper log. 

59
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,260
        at the same time,       
 it forces the copper into a die

60
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,730
        that stretches it       
  12 times its original length  

61
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:28,934
 and slims it down considerably.

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,804
       the lengthy tubing       
   cools down in a milky bath.  

63
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,072
          then a crane          
     moves it down the line     

64
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:38,544
    to equipment that adjusts   
  the diameter and chops it up. 

65
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,418
         water now flows        
 into the shorter piece of pipe,

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,086
   which is encased in a mold.  

67
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,955
    tools push into the pipe,   

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,691
        forcing the water       
    in a vertical direction.    

69
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,961
      sheer water pressure      
 reshapes the tubing into a "t,"

70
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,931
   while the mold establishes   
          the contours.         

71
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,370
"t" fittings are used to combine
   or split the flow of fluid

      in a plumbing system,     

73
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,272
   and the water forming press  

74
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,242
       does a seamless job      
         of making them.        

75
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,448
  but there's still the matter  

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,184
        of the closed end       
     at the base of the "t,"    

77
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,320
     so they chop that off.     

78
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,724
they machine all three openings,

79
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,693
  because when they connect it  
         to other pipes,        

80
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,329
        it has to fit --        
      to a "t," of course.      

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,868
  now these fittings are ready  
 to join other pipes and parts.

     to the brass cylinders     

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,165
     and drill holes in them    
 to transfer the musical score.

130
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,438
         which involves         
       cutting steel wire       

131
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,775
   and inserting it into each   
    of the cylinder's holes.    

132
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,110
     this is called pinning.    

133
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,844
and, of course, in the old days,

134
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,649
    it was all done manually    
and was far more time consuming.

135
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,453
      next, they pump resin     
        into the cylinder       

136
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,188

        from the inside.        

138

      as the resin cures.

    for the axle to turn on.

 of this spring's pent-up energy

  ever since the 14th century,  

172
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,195

      quick chopping action     

196
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,340

 slices it into shorter pieces.

   to make its grinding device  

222

242
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,978
    because this manual mill    
   will be quite a bit taller.  

243
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,180
chefs often prefer a pepper mill
           with height          

244
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,849
   because it's easier to use.  

245
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:29,060
         once assembled,        
 the pepper mill gets a fill-up.

246
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,398
   then they cap it and adjust  
 the top knob to a medium grind.

           of course,           

248
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:40,738
    all mills can be adjusted   
   for different-sized grinds.

      from fine to coarse,      
      the choice is yours.      

250
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,912
 it's really a matter of taste. 

251
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,096
  narrator: the driving force   
  behind a vehicle's direction  

252
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,498
     is the steering column.    

253
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,167
 it connects the steering wheel 
      to the front wheels.      

254
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,768
      but despite the name,     

255
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,638
         steering isn't         
 the steering column's only job.

256
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,107
         it also houses         
     the turn-signal switch     

257
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,375
      and a tilt mechanism      

258
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,345
       to adjust the angle      
     of the steering wheel.     

259
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,522
          this company          
 makes custom steering columns, 

260
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:35,460
the kind you order when building
 your own classic car or truck. 

261
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,462
       for the main shaft       
         of the column,         

262
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,931
      an automated band saw     
      slices steel tubing,      

263
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,867
         two at a time,         
      to a specific length.     

264
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,904
        this belt sander        
  smoothes out the rough edges. 

265
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,946
the next machine forms the shaft
      into a specific shape     

266
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:58,683
    that'll engage and turn     
    with the steering wheel.    

267
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:05,289
 a computer-guided laser cutter 
     makes the steel housing    

268
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,426
   that'll cover the steering   
   column's upper components.   

269
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,162
          it cuts holes         
 for the various control levers 

270
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,565
         that'll connect        
     to the steering column.    

271
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,171
        the upper housing       
     now goes onto a device     

272
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,439
      that holds it steady      

273
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,376
  while a belt grinder removes  
   any surface imperfections.   

274
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,450
meanwhile, workers weld together
      the two steel pieces      

275
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,720
        that make up the        
steering column's lower housing.

276
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,522
          then, to make         
 the steering column look sleek,

277
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:43,161
    they attach a steel cone    
   using a fine welding torch.  

278
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,938
     with an abrasive belt,     
    they polish the weld line   

279
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,739
  until it's barely noticeable. 

280
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,008
          then they do          
      an overall polishing      

281
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,679
   to make the entire surface   
   smooth and ready to paint.   

282
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,217
  they've attached a component  
  called the lower yoke shaft   

283
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,152
 to the main shaft made earlier.

284
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:12,289
  after greasing it, they snap  
  an upper yoke shaft into it.  

285
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,426
 these enable the shaft to pivot

286
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,828
          when you tilt         
      the steering column.      

287
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,566
 here, they install a component 
      in the lower housing      

288
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,571
  to which they'll later attach 
     the tilting mechanism.     

289
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,041
      once that's in place,     
    they install a pull wire    

290
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,845
      to help pull through      
 the electrical system later on.

291
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:38,617
  finally, they slide the shaft 
      through the housing.      

292
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,126
      a computer-controlled     
         milling machine        

293
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,695
 shapes the tilting mechanism's 
         aluminum body.         

294
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,132
    the next machine installs   
    position-locking fingers    

295
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,269
 which allow the column to tilt 
  when you pull the tilt lever  

296
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,573
     then re-engage to lock     
    in the selected position.   

297
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,476
  this press installs bearings  

298
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,680
             to make            
   the turning process smooth.  

299
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,087
      now the upper section     
    joins the lower section.    

300
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,958
    they attach with two pins   
 that allow the column to pivot.

301
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,762
      a thick steel spring      
      supports the column       

302
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:26,564
  so when the fingers disengage 

303
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:30,135
  the column doesn't just drop  
     into the driver's lap.     

304
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,973
       next, they install       
   the column's upper housing.  

305
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,908
         that's the part        
  with the holes for the levers 

306
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,576
      to control the tilt,      

307
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,714
        the turn signals,       
   and the emergency flashers.  

308
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,783
    remember that pull wire?    

309
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,452
  they tape the signal switches 
        and wiring to it        

310
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,521
         then pull them         
       through the column.      

311
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,323
      they'll later cushion     
         this exit hole         

312
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,492
      with a rubber grommet     
     to prevent any chafing.    

313
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,471
next, they install the horn cam.

314
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,140
  it passes power from the horn 
      to the steering wheel     

315
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,676
       to enable honking.       

316
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,411
        using this tool,        

317
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,415
  they lock in a retaining clip 
  to hold everything together.  

318
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,621
   all the wiring that passes   
   through the steering column  

319
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,090
       connects to a plug.      

320
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,560
     you just insert it into    
the vehicle's electrical system.

321
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,232
     these steering columns     
  come in a choice of finishes. 

322
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,536
 you can also buy an unfinished 
 column and paint it yourself.  

323
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:46,110
  after installing the column,  
  you just add a steering wheel 

324
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,979
 then mount the levers and knobs
      included in the kit.      

325
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,451
    then, from that point on,   
  you're in the driver's seat.  

326
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,130
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,
