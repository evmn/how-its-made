00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,757
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,893
      ...curling stones...      

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,099
       ...refrigerators...      

6
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,538
  ...aluminum baseball bats...  

7
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,844
    ...and opalescent glass.    

8
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,920
      the sport of curling      
        is a combination        

9
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,723
   of shuffleboard, billiards,  
       and bowling on ice.      

10
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,193
    players aim a large stone   
           at a target          

11
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,929
      while trying to knock     
      the opponents' stones     

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,396
      away from the target.     

13
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,665
          as the stone          
      glides along the ice,     

14
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,135
    team members sweep brooms   
           in its path          

15
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,538
           to control           
    its speed and trajectory.   

16
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,812
         curling stones         
      are made of granite,      

17
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,147
      but only two quarries     
         in the world --        

18
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,349
          one in wales          
     and one in scotland --     

19
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,352
     produce the unique type    
   of granite that's required,  

20
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,755
a fine grain and free of quartz.

21
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,156
        this unique stone       

22
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:35,494
   has three times the impact   
 resistance of regular granite. 

23
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,301
    the quarry tries to avoid   
    traditional blast mining    

24
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,704
     because that fractures     
           the stone.           

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,907
   instead, they locate flaws   
        in the rock face        

26
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,211
    and pry chunks off of it    
       with an excavator.       

27
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:58,984
 this chunk weighs about 20 tons
 and is the size of a small car.

28
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,924
  the next step is to divide it 
   into more manageable slabs   

29
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,725
   using a thick cable cutter   

30
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,829
       with abrasive rings      
   made of diamond particles.   

31
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,734
      a large pulley system     

32
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,069
moves the cable against the rock
         at high speed,         

33
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,440
  and the diamonds slowly wear  
      through the granite.      

34
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,016
 avoiding flaws and weak points,

35
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,552
      workers trace circles     
   the size of curling stones   

36
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,888
   on the best-quality areas.   

37
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,490
     the cut slab then moves    
   inside the quarry building,  

38
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,226
     where this core drill's    
         diamond cutters        

39
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,628
  bore right through the slab,  

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,398
      excising a blank that     
  will become a curling stone.  

41
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:52,837
        the blanks weigh        
    almost 60 pounds apiece.    

42
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,574
  workers lift them out with an 
 industrial-strength suction cup

43
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,377
       then transfer them       

44
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,213
   to a container bound for a   
curling-stone factory in canada.

45
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,918
 there, a drill bores a channel 
 a little over a half-inch wide 

46
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,653
    right through the center.   

47
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:12,657
      this is for attaching     
   the curling stone's handle.  

48
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,660
but that's still a long way off.

49
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,063
       first, this machine      
     has to carve the blank     

50
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,232
         into the shape         
       of a curling stone.      

51
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,472
    the machine's curved arm    
 is lined with diamond cutters. 

52
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,341
    it shapes half the stone,   

53
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,745
then workers flip the blank over
so it can finish the other half.

54
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,558
        the next machine        

55
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,562
       carves out a pocket      
   in the bottom of the stone.  

56
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,098
         this will hold         
    a high-resistance insert    

57
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,500
       of extra-fine-grain      
        scottish granite        

58
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,170
        that will extend        
    the curling stone's life.   

59
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,979
     after lining the pocket    
           with epoxy,          

60
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,847
    the insert is positioned.   

61
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,784
        a hydraulic press       
     expels any trapped air     

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,122
  and holds the insert in place 
     until it firmly bonds.     

63
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,792
    next, a grinding machine,   
      following a template,     

64
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,662
   makes a center cup in both   
the top and bottom of the stone.

65
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,533
  curlers can attach the handle 
         to either cup,         

66
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,435
            depending           
    on which granite surface    

67
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,604
  they want gliding on the ice. 

68
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,006
     workers bolt the stone     
     to a spinning polisher     

69
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,075
      and buff the surface      

70
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,413
  with five progressively finer 
grades of diamond abrasive pads.

71
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,084
    then they blast the side    
     with tiny glass beads.     

72
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:50,088
 this pits the surface to better
    distribute impact force,    

73
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,890
       preventing the side      
          from chipping         

74
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,626
   as it strikes other stones.  

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,696
   running the top and bottom   
      over coarse sandpaper     

76
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,698
  gives the stone more traction 
             on ice.            

77
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:05,003
   the finished curling stone   
     weighs in at 40 pounds.    

78
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,773
           the factory          
    molds the stone's handle    

79
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,443
          from durable          
    impact-resistant plastic.   

80
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,046
      this computer-guided      
        engraving machine       

81
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,315
        can embellish it        
     with any name or logo.     

82
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,550
        paint is applied        
      to the recessed areas     

83
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,921
 to make the lettering or design
           stand out.           

84
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,928
  finally, the finished handle  

85
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,332
     is bolted through that     
  center hole drilled earlier.  

86
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:44,208
         from the quarry        
   to the factory to the ice,   

87
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,580
this beautifully crafted curling
 stone is ready for competition.

88
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,019
        when we return...       

89
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,322
      the cold, hard truth      
      about refrigerators.      

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,626
 narrator: before refrigeration,

91
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,563
     people stored foods in     
  underground cellars or shacks 

92
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,897
    filled with snow and ice.   

93
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,434
    then in the early 1900s,    
   a french inventor developed  

94
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,071
    the first machine to cool   
   and preserve foods at home.  

95
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,513
     the modern refrigerator    

96
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:25,383
   comes in countless styles,   
       sizes, and colors.       

97
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,720
      manufacturing begins      
  with coiled sheets of steel.  

98
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,791
just one of these coils produces
  hundreds of fridge exteriors. 

99
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:36,328
     the interiors are made     
  from rust-resistant aluminum  

100
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,396
  lined with an acrylic shell.  

101
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,399
       a shearing machine       
  slices the steel into pieces  

102
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,602
      for the exterior top,     
        back, and sides.        

103
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,539
       then each one goes       
 into a computerized punch press

104
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,877
      that makes the holes      
   for running various wires.   

105
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,816
 a brake press forces the steel 
      against a forming die     

106
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,651
        to create edges.        

107
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,756
       next, workers place      

108
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,026
          the pieces of         
 the refrigerator's outer shell 

109
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,763
    in an assembly jig, which   
   holds them firmly together.  

110
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,436
 now for the fridge's interior. 

111
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,706
    a vacuum-forming machine    
    heats a sheet of plastic    

112
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,776
          and shapes it         
    against an aluminum mold.   

113
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,115
    then a router carves off    
     all the excess plastic.    

114
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,719
        the freezer half        
       of the refrigerator      

115
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,322
        slides perfectly        
   into the metal outer shell,  

116
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,191
       and the fridge side      
            follows.            

117
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,528
          copper tubes,         
     filled with heated gas,    

118
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,330
  are laid along the outer edge 

119
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,532
         where the door         
      contacts the fridge.      

120
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,835
        the gas prevents        
        moisture buildup.       

121
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,340
       a precut face frame      
     goes onto the assembly.    

122
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,408
      then foam is injected     

123
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,678
   into the cavity between the  
  interior and exterior shells. 

124
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,282
  this foam not only insulates  
        the refrigerator        

125
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,952
          but gives it          
  structural rigidity, as well. 

126
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,358
this evaporator plays a key role
     in keeping things cool.    

127
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,529
      it draws the heat out     
of the freezer and its contents.

128
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,436
      next, the electrical      
 control panel goes into place. 

129
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,639
 it connects to a maze of wires 

130
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,442
        and, eventually,        
        a microprocessor.       

131
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,912
      with the freezer side     
        almost complete,        

132
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,248
         the fridge side        
      gets its evaporator.      

133
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,818
           next comes           
     the refrigerator doors.    

134
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,189
         two compressors        
       pump fluid and gas       

135
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,390
             through            
    the various tubes inside.   

136
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,793
         this component,        
      called the radiator,      

137
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,596
       dissipates the heat      
    collected from the food.    

138
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,337
         workers attach         
      the expansion valves.     

139
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,340
           these allow          
 the pressurized liquid coolant 

140
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,942
    to expand into a cold gas   

141
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,212
     that circulates through    
    the refrigerator's tubes.   

142
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,884
    copper tubes are soldered   
       to the compressor.       

143
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,754
    later, they'll be filled    
        with refrigerant.       

144
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,790
 temporary quick-connect valves 

145
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,892
        allow the system        
  to be charged with inert gas  

146
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,761
     to check for any leaks.    

147
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,632
  the fill hoses are connected, 
      and the gas blows in.     

148
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,238
    inspectors use this wand    

149
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,774
       to check the tubes       
        for escaping gas.       

150
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,375
       if there's a leak,       

151
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,911
        the gauge spikes        
   out of the specified range.  

152
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,586
refrigeration occurs as cold gas
     in the evaporator coils    

153
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,389
        pulls heat energy       
     from inside the fridge.    

154
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,926
   the compressor then changes  
    the gas back to a liquid    

155
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:58,196
       while the radiator       
 dissipates the collected heat. 

156
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,866
    the expansion valve turns   
the liquid back into a cold gas,

157
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,603
     and the cycle repeats.     

158
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,737
      with a charging gun,      

159
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,874
 workers inject refrigerant gas 
         into each tube         

160
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,477
            then weld           
   the ends of the tube shut.   

161
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,284
 now for the finishing touches, 

162
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,154
            starting            
 with the refrigerator handles. 

163
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,691
     drawers for fruits and     
  vegetables slide right in --  

164
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,061
  so do the rest of the premade 
    shelves and compartments.   

165
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:40,105
    finally, an adhesive logo   
       goes onto the door.      

166
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:48,245
     built-in, stand-alone,     
  double-door, or traditional,  

167
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,782
 the refrigerator keeps our food
         fresh and cool,        

168
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,084
    just the way we like it.    

169
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,253
           up next...           

170
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,091
   a factory that tries to hit  
     a home run every time.     

171
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,863
            narrator:           
  on today's baseball diamonds, 
  the ping of the aluminum bat  

172
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,267
      is rivaling the crack     
   of its wooden predecessor.   

173
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,336
       the pros still use       
        traditional wood,       

174
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:17,275
 but outside the major leagues, 
the metal bat is a definite hit.

175
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,018
    lightweight and durable,    

176
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,621
     the metal bat has some     
 definite advantages over wood. 

177
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,559
     production begins with     
  aircraft-grade aluminum rods. 

178
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:39,964
   these rods are sliced into   
   short chunks called blanks.  

179
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:47,005
  the blanks are loaded into a  
lathe with a computerized drill.

180
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,447
  the drill tunnels through the 
center of the blank as it spins.

181
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:06,457
    then the blank undergoes    
 what's called impact extrusion.

182
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,660
     with 300 tons of force,    

183
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,663
      a shaping tool bores      
   into the hole in the blank,  

184
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,265
   stretching it to more than   
        twice its length        

185
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,802
  and giving it the basic taper 
       of a baseball bat.       

186
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,274
    the stretched bat blanks    

187
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,444
         now tumble into        
     a big, perforated drum.    

188
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,117
       the drum is lowered      
   into a tank of soapy water.  

189
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,088
          as it turns,          
 water flows through its holes, 

190
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,725
 washing away any oily residue. 

191
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,029
            and now,            
    for a real heavy hitter.    

192
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,299
        this forming tool       
     delivers 400-ton punch     

193
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,502
       through the center       
        of the bat blank.       

194
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,504
          the aluminum          
    stretches around the tool   

195
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,241
       to the full length       
  and shape of a baseball bat.  

196
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,250
  a technician measures the bat 

197
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,585
         to confirm that        
    it's completely straight.   

198
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,321
          if it's not,          

199
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,058
 she applies a little hydraulic 
 pressure to bend it into shape.

200
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,129
 this is a critical step because
   even a slightly crooked bat  

201
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,399
     could throw the player     
      off his or her game.      

202
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:35,880
     next, the bat goes into    
   another computerized lathe.  

203
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,815
          as it spins,          

204
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:42,086
 a blade lops off the bat's end,
       cutting it to size.      

205
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,291
 another tool threads the inside
         for the endcap.        

206
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,831
        the bat is locked       
     into a holding device,     

207
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,267
       and a circular saw       
      trims the handle end.     

208
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,510
        now that the bat        
    has been correctly sized,   

209
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,646
            it's time           
     for a vigorous sanding.    

210
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,581
          this gets rid         
      of any small defects      

211
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:14,018
    and roughs up the surface   
   so paint will stick to it.   

212
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,996
    they use heavy-duty paint   

213
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:29,200
  because baseball bats have to 
   stand up to a lot of abuse.  

214
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,208
     the sanded bats go into    
      a silk-screen machine     

215
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,510
   that applies the trademark.  

216
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,453
            then it's           
  over to the decal department. 

217
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,689
           the decals           
   are dipped into a solution   

218
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,825
    that activates the glue,    

219
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,961
 then they're stuck into place. 

220
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,636
            now it's            
    back under the paint gun    

221
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,339
        for a clear coat        
        of polyurethane.        

222
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:17,715
 the plastic endcap is press-fit
     into the hollow barrel.    

223
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,323
        an aluminum knob        
   slides onto the handle end,  

224
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,059
   and the assembly goes into   
  an automated welding machine  

225
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,294
    that fuses them together.   

226
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,802
        now for the grip.       

227
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,205
        synthetic leather       
  is wrapped around the handle  

228
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,874
  to provide a nonslip surface. 

229
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,612
     and a little vinyl tape    
       finishes the edge.       

230
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,282
    from a solid little chunk   
           of aluminum          

231
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,551
 to a hollow metal baseball bat,

232
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,555
    this powerhouse is ready    
   to hit one out of the park.  

233
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,159
          coming up...          

234
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,363
         the hot secrets        
    behind opalescent glass.    

235
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,102
narrator: glassmaking dates back
     more than 40 centuries.    

236
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,703
     but in the late 1800s,     

237
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,239
           glassmakers          
    created something new --    

238
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,576
    glass that was both milky   
        and translucent.        

239
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,979
they called it opalescent glass.

240
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,581
       like its namesake,       
       the opal gemstone,       

241
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,385
   its beauty lies in the way   
 it magically catches the light.

242
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,860
        opalescent glass        
   is a semitransparent glass   

243
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,364
     in either a solid color    
   or a swirling mix of hues.   

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,267
     glass makers create it     
      by melting minerals,      

245
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,336
    including silica sand...    

246
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,140
         ...soda ash...         

247
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,910
         ...dolomite...         

248
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,581
         ...limestone...        

249
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,884
        ...and fluorspar.       

250
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,489
   adding recycled glass helps  
  speed up the melting process  

251
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,691
      and stretches costly      
     raw materials further.     

252
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,629
             the mix            
    is colored with pigments,   

253
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,430
   in this case, cobalt oxide,  

254
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,034
           which gives          
    a distinctive blue tint.    

255
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,442
       a hoist then lifts       
the raw ingredients called batch

256
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,110
  to a double-chambered mixer.  

257
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,980
        ingredients flow        
  from end to end between them, 

258
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,516
 thoroughly blending the batch. 

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,229
   the blended batch now goes   
   via wagon to the beehive --  

260
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,466
     a furnace that contains    
        12 ceramic pots.        

261
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,336
       the furnace worker       
  shovels the batch into a pot  

262
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,406
      to melt at a searing      
    2,600 degrees fahrenheit.   

263
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,010
      he pushes any spills      
       back into the pot.       

264
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,880
         then to control        
     the temperature inside,    

265
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,550
   closes up the pot's mouth.   

266
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,288
         24 hours later,        

267
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,357
        workers scoop out       
    the glowing molten glass.   

268
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:17,161
   with only seconds to spare,  
 they hurry to the mixing table,

269
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,030
   keeping the glass in motion  

270
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:22,033
   to prevent it from cooling   
      unevenly on the way.      

271
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,770
   it's critical they cool off  
   the ladles between each use  

272
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:29,707
 or the next scoop of glass will
 adhere to the ladle's surface. 

273
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,844
       the ladles they use      
          vary in size,         

274
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:37,248
 holding between 4 and 40 pounds
        of molten glass.        

275
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:44,121
     workers pour as many as    
  five different ladles at once 

276
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,524
     to make a single color.    

277
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,595
        the mixing table        
   is where the magic happens.  

278
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,298
  the table worker picks up one 
 gather of burning molten glass,

279
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,000
          then another,         

280
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,804
   then skillfully blends them  
  together using a steel fork.  

281
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,607
 he then flips the molten glass 
     into a rolling machine,    

282
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,410
  evening it out as it squeezes 
      through the rollers.      

283
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,881
        out comes a sheet       
        about 6 feet long       

284
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,483
   and 1/8th of an inch thick.  

285
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,488
        every 90 seconds,       
    workers fill their ladles   

286
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,892
  with 2,000 degree fahrenheit  
          molten glass.         

287
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,897
  mixing it on the table helps  
  cool it and blend the colors. 

288
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,175
        the table worker        
    separates the glass sheet   

289
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,709
     from the table surface,    

290
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,845
         forcing out any        
       trapped air bubbles      

291
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,648
 and further cooling the glass. 

292
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,584
       the sheet now goes       
         into a lehr --         

293
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,586
 an oven that hardens the glass,

294
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:53,056
      then cools it evenly      
      to prevent cracking.      

295
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,193
           from there,          
 it's on to the trimming table. 

296
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,263
workers wear protective clothing
        and thick gloves        

297
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,600
 to handle the razor-sharp edges
     still hot to the touch.    

298
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,204
    cutting the glass sheets    
 is a delicate, two-person job. 

299
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,940
     they must work in sync     

300
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,875
  to keep pace with the sheets  
      that keep on coming.      

301
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:16,347
      a single pot produces     
 about 25 sheets over 24 hours. 

302
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:21,052
     that's 300 sheets a day    
  from just one 12-pot furnace. 

303
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:27,424
 using a carbide-tipped cutter, 
  the workers score the glass,  

304
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:32,363
  then snap apart the pieces -- 
 standard 32-inch square sheets.

305
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:44,375
 they set aside the excess glass
    to remelt in a new batch.   

306
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,513
       finally, the sheets      
     are loaded into crates     

307
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,383
for shipment all over the world.

308
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:56,520
      just look how artists     
      use opalescent glass      

309
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:00,224
  to create a feast of pattern, 
        color, and light.       

310
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,663
        like a painting,        
     only far more fragile.     

311
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,266
