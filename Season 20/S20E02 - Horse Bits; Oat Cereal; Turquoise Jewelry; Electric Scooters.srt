00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,040
      captions paid for by      
   discovery communications     

3
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,054
           narrator:            
    for thousands of years,     

4
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,256
          riders have           
   communicated with horses     

5
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,591
      by inserting a bit        

6
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:01,127
     in the sensitive area      
     of the animal's mouth      

7
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,797
  and manipulating it to steer  
               him              
   in the desired direction.    

8
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,734
    the first bits were made    
 of rope, wood, and even bone.  

9
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,305
  over time, bits have become   
      far more elaborate.       

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,277
          with silver           
   and gold embellishments,     

11
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,681
  these western-style bits are  
  definitely an extravagance.   

12
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,751
 but serious riders don't mind  

13
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,621
      putting their money       
 where their horse's mouth is.  

14
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,291
        to make a bit,          

15
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,229
   the maker first pounds his   
              name              
  onto a curved steel piece.    

16
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,633
  this is the part of the bit   
   that the reins attach to.    

17
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:43,636
he stamps one letter at a time  

18
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:46,706
   to make the lettering fit    
  the curvature of this part.   

19
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,112
 he aims a torch at the center  
  of a steel bar to soften it   

20
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:56,382
       so it can be bent        
       entirely by hand.        

21
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,317
       he bends the steel       
        around fixtures         

22
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,720
        to shape it into        
      the bit mouthpiece.       

23
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,457
    the mouthpiece will rest    
     on the horse's tongue      

24
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,325
   and the toothless sections   
         of the mouth           

25
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,994
       between the front        
        and back teeth.         

26
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,530
     the size and contours      
         must be exact          

27
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:15,101
     in order for it to sit     
            properly            
     in the horse's mouth.      

28
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,138
       he pounds the part       
  that will lie on the tongue   

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,141
 to give it a downward curve.   

30
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,077
      he trims and shapes       
 the mouthpiece a little more   

31
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,681
    and polishes it until it    
            gleams.             

32
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,217
     he inserts steel balls     
         in both ends           

33
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,886
      and tack-welds them       
      to the mouthpiece.        

34
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,758
         the balls are          
  part of a hinge mechanism.    

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,962
    he now permanently welds    
 the balls to the mouthpiece.   

36
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,099
       next, he installs        
        a copper roller         

37
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,034
      on the mouthpiece.        

38
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,369
      the roller will act       
     as a kind of soother,      

39
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,839
      providing an outlet       
  for nervous tongue action.    

40
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,110
            he sands            
 the end of a curved steel rod  

41
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,445
      to bevel the edge.        

42
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:03,449
        it will be part         
  of one of the bit's shanks.   

43
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:07,052
     he places the top part     
of the bit shank in a fixture,  

44
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,256
 followed by three curved rods  
   and a ring for the reins.    

45
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:18,130
    now, perfectly aligned,     
     he welds all the parts     
           together.            

46
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,735
  this bit shank is now ready   
 for some decorative touches.   

47
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:27,406
      he welds tiny beads       
    of stainless steel to the   
             shank,             

48
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:30,943
      making it look like       
       a row of pearls.         

49
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:35,413
    he gives the bit's second   
              shank             
     the same beaded look.      

50
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,050
   he assembles the shank to    
       the two ends of the      
          mouthpiece.           

51
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,822
 the two shanks are ornamental, 
        yet functional,         

52
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,059
 connecting the bit mouthpiece  
   to the bridle and reins.     

53
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,599
    he welds the hinge pins     
        to the shanks.          

54
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,704
     next, an engraver cuts     
       decorative shapes        

55
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,439
      in sterling silver,       
      wriggling the tool        

56
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,376
      for a zigzag effect       
       around the edges.        

57
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,244
   he carves swirls onto it.    

58
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,382
   it takes years of practice   
   to perfect this artistry.    

59
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:14,253
         one false move         
    and he'd ruin the part.     

60
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,521
      once the engraving is     
           complete,            

61
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,726
       he brushes an acid       
cleaning solution on the back.  

62
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,262
         he then melts          
    a tin-and-silver alloy      

63
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:26,799
   and applies it to the back   
    of the engraved piece,      

64
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,735
          spreading it          
     for maximum coverage.      

65
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,271
       this molten metal        
    will serve as a solder      

66
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,940
   to fuse the engraved part    
         to the shank.          

67
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:40,012
     to prepare the shank,      
  he heats it from the bottom   

68
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:43,148
         and cleans it          
      with more of the acid     
           solution.            

69
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,217
    he applies more solder      

70
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,020
         and transfers          
      the engraved silver       

71
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,689
       to the bit shank.        

72
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:56,896
 he reheats the shank to ensure 
    the solder is completely    
             molten             

73
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,532
         before cooling         
and fusing the parts together.  

74
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,637
    the engraving is now one    
        with the shank,         

75
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,239
        and he washes it        
     with clear tap water.      

76
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,445
        after he solders        
  more engravings to the bit,   

77
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,348
     he polishes the silver     
       until it gleams.         

78
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,055
    now, the bit just needs     
        the headstall.          

79
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,656
  that's the leather harness    

80
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,727
       that holds the bit       
     in the horse's mouth.      

81
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,932
  he slips the headstall tabs   
into rings on the bit's shanks  

82
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:36,335
   and screws the ends of each  
               tab              
    very tightly together.      

83
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,671
   crafted entirely by hand,    

84
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,075
   it takes a couple of days    
  to make one of these bits.    

85
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,144
          after that,           

86
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,313
      it's time to take it      
       for a test trot.         

87
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,799
 narrator: breakfast cereal is  
      most commonly made        

88
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,035
   from such grains as wheat,   
     corn, rice, and oats.      

89
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,105
   oats are a popular choice    
      for health reasons.       

90
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:16,508
  they contain a soluble fiber  
      called beta-glucan,       

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,443
      which, when consumed      
           regularly,           

92
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,513
         helps maintain         
    normal blood cholesterol    
            levels.             

93
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,453
  these tasty little oat "o"s   

94
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,456
       come ready to eat        
      in a bowl with milk       

95
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,661
       or dry as an easy        
  and portable crunchy snack.   

96
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,996
    at the cereal factory,      

97
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,798
       production begins        
  with the bulk ingredients,    

98
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,868
        mainly oat flour        
       and wheat starch.        

99
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,804
     after the mixer blends     
 these ingredients thoroughly,  

100
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,472
an air-driven tubular conveyer  

101
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,607
         transfers them         
     to the next station,       

102
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,278
        which blends in         
       the lesser-quantity      
          ingredients,          

103
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,946
        primarily salt          

104
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,682
    and fortifying minerals     
       such as calcium.         

105
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,550
 the entire dry mix is sifted,  

106
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,353
        then transferred        
     to the next station,       

107
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,289
        which adds water        
  to transform it into dough.   

108
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,224
   then the machine cooks the   
             dough              

109
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,928
    by heating it with steam    
  for approximately a minute.   

110
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,166
      an extrusion machine      
   now compresses the dough     

111
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:17,403
     and forces it through      
a stainless-steel forming die.  

112
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,306
   the forming die is a large   
              disc              

113
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,609
         with hundreds          
  of little "o"-shaped holes.   

114
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,717
 the dough exits the die holes  
   as long "o"-shaped tubes,    

115
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,688
     which knives then cut      
     into individual "o"s.      

116
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,725
        at this point,          

117
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,195
 the cereal's moisture content  
         is about 30%.          

118
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,731
     in order for the "o"s      
        to be crunchy,          

119
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,233
     that has to be reduced     
         to about 3%.           

120
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,339
      so the next station       
      spreads them out on a     
           conveyer,            

121
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,209
     which travels through      
   a warm-air drying tunnel     

122
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,811
      for about an hour.        

123
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,617
    when the cereal exits the   
             dryer,             

124
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,422
    the moisture content is     
      down to about 11%.        

125
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,091
     the next operation is      
        so top-secret,          

126
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,093
       the company won't        
        let us show it.         

127
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,162
    it's called expansion.      

128
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:21,366
  a heating process turns the   
moisture in the "o"s to steam.  

129
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,303
      this expanding steam      
        puffs the "o"s          

130
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,439
          much the way          
     hot air pops popcorn.      

131
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,843
   this is what the "o"s look   
              like              
     prior to expansion...      

132
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,445
          and after.            

133
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,548
     they lighten in color      
    due to the air inside.      

134
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,187
             next,              
     the cereal travels over    
            screens.            

135
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,858
   the mesh is just the right   
              size              
to let the "o"s remain on top,  

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,594
 and any smaller, broken pieces 
         fall through.          

137
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,667
     now the cereal enters      
     the coating station.       

138
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,404
  the coating is a combination  
      of sugar and water,       

139
00:08:58,406 --> 00:08:59,938
     with water boiled out      

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,175
     to reduce the mixture      
   to a concentrated syrup.     

141
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,345
       the cereal enters        
        a coating drum.         

142
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:11,483
   inside, two nozzles spray    
    the syrup on the "o"s.      

143
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,418
  continual rotation ensures    

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,921
       the application is       
      thorough and even.        

145
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:23,094
       to dry the coating       
  and further dry the cereal,   

146
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,030
 the "o"s now travel on a belt  
through another warm-air dryer  

147
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,500
     for about 20 minutes.      

148
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,303
          this reduces          
 the cereal's moisture content  

149
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,939
  to the target level of 3%.    

150
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,315
     for quality control,       

151
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,885
  the factory regularly tests   
     samples of the finished    
            product.            

152
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:52,056
        first measuring         
    the moisture content...     

153
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,659
  then checking the density,    

154
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:57,596
     which is calculated by     
            weighing            
a specific quantity of cereal.  

155
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,807
   assuming everything checks   
              out,              

156
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,444
      the cereal proceeds       
         to packaging.          

157
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:18,216
  the packaging machine feeds   
   plastic film around a fill   
             tube,              

158
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,586
         which drops in         
     20 ounces of cereal.       

159
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,088
 heat seals the top of the bag  

160
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,159
     as well as the bottom      
 of what will be the next bag,  

161
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:30,429
 then cuts the filled bag loose 
  to the conveyer belt below.   

162
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:33,365
       it passes the bags       
   through a metal detector     

163
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,435
  to ensure no foreign object   
     fell in accidentally       

164
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,236
      during production.        

165
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:42,374
  the next machine slides each  
               bag              
     into a cereal carton,      

166
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,710
   stamps on the eight-month    
      "best before" date,       

167
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,715
   then seals the carton flap   
              shut              
   with food-grade hot glue.    

168
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,451
     as each box of cereal      
  exits the production line,    

169
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,053
         it passes over         
what's called a check weigher,  

170
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,522
     a scale which ensures      
     the package contains       

171
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,859
      the correct quantity      
        of oat cereal.          

172
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,876
 narrator: turquois jewelry has 
    adorned the human form      

173
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,478
    for thousands of years.     

174
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,480
   worn by egyptian pharaohs    
       and aztec kings,         

175
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,284
          turquois was          
  one of the first gemstones    

176
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:28,020
  to be crafted into jewelry.   

177
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,755
     fast forward to today      

178
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,824
    and turquois hasn't lost    
          its luster.           

179
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,298
  in the american southwest,    

180
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,433
       native people have       
     long mined the earth       

181
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,903
      for a stone that is       
      as blue as the sky.       

182
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,140
   turning it into jewelry is   
      a tribal tradition.       

183
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,377
           there are            
   many shades of turquois,     

184
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,913
          and some are          
   more greenish than blue.     

185
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,449
     the artist rinses off      
      the dirt and debris       

186
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,052
           to reveal            
 the true color of each stone.  

187
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,489
       he evaluates them        
       and selects one.         

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,927
   he cuts it with a circular   
              saw.              

189
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,263
          as he cuts,           

190
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,999
    he lubricates the stone     
  with water to keep it cool,   

191
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,402
     because too much heat      
  could cause discoloration.    

192
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,471
    he cuts the stone thinner   
             again,             

193
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,807
          with an eye           
    to fitting the turquois     

194
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,575
 in a silver pendant setting.   

195
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,279
      he sands the surface      
        flat and smooth         

196
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,281
      so it will sit well       
        in the setting.         

197
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,821
 he selects coordinating pieces 
       for a mosaic work        

198
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,724
    and sands them to create    
   an equally flat surface.     

199
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,228
      he now etches a line      
     on a sheet of silver       

200
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,764
 and then saws along this line  
  to produce a silver strip.    

201
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,900
     this silver strip will     
          now be used           

202
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,435
 to make the pendant setting.   

203
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,972
       he wraps it around       
        a steel mandrel         

204
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,174
   to shape it into a loop.     

205
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,780
 then, using a leather mallet,  

206
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,583
  he gently pounds the silver   
        to the mandrel          

207
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,983
     to perfect the shape.      

208
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:10,255
    he pinches the ends with    
             pliers             
      to close the loop.        

209
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,859
next, he saws a silver square.  

210
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,995
           he stamps            
 the maker's insignia onto it,  

211
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:21,066
    as well as the hallmark     
     indicating the silver's    
            purity.             

212
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,069
    he seals the silver loop    
         with solder.           

213
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,605
      he places the loop        

214
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,340
          on the front          
     of the silver square       

215
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,009
that he's covered with a flux.  

216
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,278
     this paste facilitates     
     the soldering process      

217
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,015
    as he now joins the loop    
        to the square.          

218
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,018
       he cuts the square       
    to round it to the loop     

219
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,553
      using metal shears.       

220
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,356
  the pendant setting has now   
         taken shape.           

221
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,360
  using a fine abrasive file,   

222
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,563
    he gets rid of the excess   
             silver             
        around the rim,         

223
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,265
  and he smoothes the edges.    

224
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,637
    he solders a loop for the   
              chain             
    to the pendant setting.     

225
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,040
   the chain loop is known as   
           the bail.            

226
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,045
    the artist is now ready     

227
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,748
  to create a turquois mosaic   
       in this setting.         

228
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,119
     the initial cuts were      
       just approximate,        

229
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:18,056
  so the stones don't exactly   
 fit together in the setting.   

230
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,926
       he grinds each one       
      a little at a time        

231
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,194
        until they do.          

232
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,331
          he's careful          
    to not grind too much.      

233
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,467
     that would leave gaps      
        in the mosaic.          

234
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,270
      each stone must sit       
    snugly against the next     

235
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,273
    in the silver setting.      

236
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,942
he handles the turquois gently  

237
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,311
   because it's a soft stone    
      and breaks easily.        

238
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,815
  in the event of a fracture,   
         he improvises          

239
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,751
        and treats it as        
   an artistic opportunity.     

240
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,153
       he cuts a tiny bit       
       of another stone         

241
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,555
    to complete the mosaic.     

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,693
 it serves as an accent piece,  

243
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,062
           enhancing            
  this stone mosaic pattern.    

244
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,633
      the turquois stones       
     now all fit together       

245
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,503
   like pieces of a puzzle.     

246
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,840
     he removes the stones      
       from the setting         

247
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,575
  and mixes a two-part epoxy.   

248
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,378
  he applies a generous amount  
        to the setting.         

249
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,448
 he places the turquois stones  
      back in the pendant       

250
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,316
        in their original       
         configuration.         

251
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,121
    the epoxy dries quickly     

252
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,391
      and the stones bond       
   to the silver in minutes.    

253
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,996
    the turquois mosaic now     
     undergoes an intensive     
            sanding,            

254
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,466
           beginning            
  with a rough-grit sandpaper   

255
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,201
  and ending with a fine one.   

256
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:40,505
  the sanding makes the seams   
       almost disappear.        

257
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,476
   he applies a sapphire grit   
      and water solution        

258
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,945
  to a leather buffing wheel    

259
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,449
    and polishes the pendant    
    until it takes on a nice    
            patina.             

260
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,623
   crafted using techniques     

261
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,759
          handed down           
   through the generations,     

262
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,695
    native turquois jewelry     
   still makes a statement.     

263
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,098
   that's why it never seems    
      to go out of style.       

264
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,253
  narrator: an electric scooter 
               is               
      a motorized version       

265
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,055
       of the traditional       
          foot-powered          
         kick scooter.          

266
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,592
   while the kick scooter is    
     designed primarily for     
           children,            

267
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,460
      the battery-powered       
       electric scooter         

268
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,532
 is decidedly an adult vehicle, 
 popular with urban commuters   

269
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:44,035
      looking for a simple      
and inexpensive set of wheels.  

270
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,407
this isn't your kid's scooter.  

271
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,010
 lightweight, battery-powered,  
         and foldable,          

272
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,679
       it reaches speeds        
  of up to 20 miles per hour    

273
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,213
   and can carry a passenger    

274
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,150
         weighing up to         
      a hefty 250 pounds.       

275
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,087
    most of the components,     

276
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,889
      like this sprocket,       
 which goes on the rear wheel,  

277
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,091
            are made            
 of aircraft-grade aluminum --  

278
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,594
        a high-strength,        
    yet lightweight metal.      

279
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,164
   after cutting the shape,     

280
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,101
  the computer-guided milling   
 machine cuts decorative holes  

281
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,903
    that further lighten the    
            weight.             

282
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,842
       a punch press cuts       
 the shape of the brake disc,   

283
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,377
     made of aircraft-grade     
       stainless steel,         

284
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,880
         also a strong,         
    yet lightweight metal.      

285
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,486
  the scooter chassis is made   
    of high-strength steel.     

286
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,789
          to one end,           

287
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,793
     they weld on a bushing     
      for the real axle.        

288
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,194
       to the other end,        

289
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,197
     a large tube to house      
 the scooter's electric motor.  

290
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,942
     to that support tube,      

291
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,412
           they weld            
 the front part of the chassis  

292
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,014
 to which they'll later connect 
        the handlebar.          

293
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,850
       they also weld on        
 a support for the rear wheel.  

294
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,158
  they paint the chassis with   

295
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,894
  what's known in the industry  
       as powder coat --        

296
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:20,231
  dry paint particles applied   
 with an electrostatic charge,  

297
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:24,102
 an application technique which 
 ensures full, even coverage.   

298
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,572
   the chassis goes through an  
              oven              
    for about five minutes      

299
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,774
       at 403 fahrenheit        

300
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,510
    to bake on the finish.      

301
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,179
   the brake disc, meanwhile,   
       has gone through         

302
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,715
    a heat-treatment process    
      for strengthening,        

303
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,784
        and has acquired        
       aluminum spacers         

304
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,188
      to properly position      
the first magnesium wheel rim,  

305
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,257
      which goes on next,       
 followed by the rubber tire,   

306
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,926
  then the second wheel rim.    

307
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:50,795
          to hold this          
front wheel assembly together,  

308
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,996
     they thread a lug nut      

309
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,666
    into the bolt protruding    
       from each spacer.        

310
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,401
       these lug nuts are       
         self-locking,          

311
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,203
    meaning their threads are   
             shaped             
         in such a way          

312
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,473
     that they won't loosen     
      during normal use.        

313
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:06,077
            this is             
 an important safety feature.   

314
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,748
    next, workers insert the    
battery-powered electric motor  

315
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,550
     into the support tube      
        on the chassis.         

316
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,887
    after securing the motor    
     in place with screws,      

317
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,290
          they install          
   the drive-chain adjuster.    

318
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:23,094
    the drive chain links the   
              motor             
      to the rear wheel.        

319
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,630
    this adjuster maintains     
 the appropriate chain tension  

320
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,531
     under all conditions.      

321
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,568
  now they mount the rear axle  
        and rear wheel          

322
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,303
   with its large sprocket.     

323
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,840
 they install a small sprocket  
      on the drive shaft,       

324
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,309
    which protrudes from the    
             motor.             

325
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,846
    then they take the drive    
             chain,             
 made of high-strength steel,   

326
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,315
       and hook it around       
      the two sprockets.        

327
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,185
   they mount the rear fender   
       and chain guard,         

328
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,854
           both made            
   of high-strength plastic,    

329
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,725
 then tighten the axle to hold  
 everything together securely.  

330
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,461
      now for the scooter's     
           handlebar.           

331
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,664
  an automated welding machine  
   fuses two aluminum tubes     

332
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,799
          into a "t."           

333
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,734
   after chemically treating    
         the handlebar          

334
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,335
to prevent corrosion and wear,  

335
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,871
    they install a catch that   
              holds             
    the handle to the base      

336
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,339
  when the scooter's folded.    

337
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:12,543
    next, the lever for the     
 disc brake on the front wheel  

338
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,146
and the control for the motor.  

339
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,483
      last but not least,       
    rubber handlebar grips,     

340
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,652
embossed with a snazzy design.  

341
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,688
     the motor control has      
    a push-button ignition,     

342
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,625
        a thumb throttle        
     for regulating speed,      

343
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,360
 and a battery-life indicator.  

344
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,631
     with the motor control     
        and brake lines         

345
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,433
      taped in their proper     
           position,            

346
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,969
 workers mount the handlebar on 
   the chassis with the hinge   
              pin,              

347
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,240
    enabling it to fold down    
        onto the base.          

348
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:45,844
   they mount the front wheel   
     with its disc brake.       

349
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,246
       when you activate        
  the handlebar brake lever,    

350
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,314
      this caliper and pad      
        grab the disc,          

351
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:53,117
    which stops the rotating    
             wheel.             

352
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,588
  an aluminum pan in the base   
      holds the battery,        

353
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,790
        battery charger,        
   and all the electronics.     

354
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,525
         they cover it          
   with a birchwood platform    

355
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,861
  on which the rider stands.    

356
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,997
          the wood has          
    a weatherproof coating      

357
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,666
 and features the company logo  
      in nonskid material       

358
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:11,402
           to prevent           
      the rider's feet from     
           slipping.            

359
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,338
   the mechanics are simple.    

360
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,674
    the motor turns the drive   
             shaft,             
      which turns the small     
           sprocket,            

361
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,209
    which turns the chain,      

362
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,545
 which turns the large sprocket 
  mounted on the rear wheel,    

363
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,015
    propelling the scooter.
