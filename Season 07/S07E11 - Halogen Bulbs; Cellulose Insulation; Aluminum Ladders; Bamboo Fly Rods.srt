00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,090
            narrator:           
  today, on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,893
        halogen bulbs...        

5
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,932
   ...cellulose insulation...   

6
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,505
     ...aluminum ladders...     

7
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,511
     ...and bamboo fly rods.    

8
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,720
       halogen headlights       

9
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,989
         are an example         
   of technological progress.   

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,192
        the halogen bulbs       
     throw cool, white light    

11
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,262
      that mimics daylight,     
  illuminating the road ahead.  

12
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,731
           and because          
    they're energy-efficient,   

13
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,466
 they don't burn out too often. 

14
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,836
that's a plus when you're trying
 to keep your eyes on the road. 

15
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,075
  to make a halogen headlight,  

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,812
      mechanical jaws load      
three lead wires into a machine.

17
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:26,051
     a gripper moves in and     
 bends the wires at the bottom. 

18
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,620
  meanwhile, a conveyer system  

19
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,190
     feeds little glass rods    
          to a burner.          

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,297
       the softened glass       
         is now pressed         

21
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,766
      under either side of      
 the lead wires, encasing them. 

22
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,502
      next, a welding head      
      fuses tungsten coils      

23
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,239
   to the lead-wire assembly.   

24
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,907
    the coil is the filament,   

25
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,478
      the part of the bulb      
        that emits light.       

26
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,314
    over at another station,    

27
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:00,719
 a mechanical arm loads a glass 
    tube into a machine head.   

28
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,089
      a burner aims a flame     
 at the center to soften it up. 

29
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,662
      then mechanical heads     
   pull the glass at both ends  

30
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,731
     as the burner continues    
   to fire heat at the middle.  

31
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,334
this creates a neck in the tube.

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,941
  now mechanical arms position  
 the coil-and-lead-wire assembly

33
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,544
     under the newly shaped     
          glass tubes.          

34
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,616
  grippers lower the glass tube 
            over them           

35
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,184
   so they sit under the neck.  

36
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,757
  burners move in and encircle  
    the glass at the bottom,    

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,159
          softening it.         

38
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,933
  then a press seals the glass  
     around the lead wires,     

39
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,169
 which protrude from the bottom.

40
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,774
  next, a test -- an electrode  
     sparks the lead wires.     

41
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,576
  when the capsule illuminates, 

42
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,911
        it means there's        
       ambient air inside       

43
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,014
      that would interfere      
    with the bulb's function.   

44
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,253
 vacuums at the top of the bulb 

45
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,522
      suck out all the air      
        and contaminants.       

46
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,661
       then nozzles spray       
 liquid nitrogen onto the bulb. 

47
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,732
 this freezes it inside and out,
 creating a pressure difference.

48
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:24,670
     that change in pressure    
 pulls halogen gas into the bulb

49
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,872
      from a chamber above.     

50
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,608
        allowing no time        
     for the gas to escape,     

51
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,511
        burners heat-seal       
      the bulb at the neck.     

52
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:39,884
the bulbs then cool as they move
      on a transfer chain.      

53
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,522
   grippers now load the bulbs  
      into another machine.     

54
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,226
        a pusher moves up       
   and snaps a steel retainer   

55
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,096
 around the bottom of each bulb.

56
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,632
   meanwhile, another machine   
  builds the base for the bulb. 

57
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,537
  it pushes electrical contacts 
  into the plastic receptacle.  

58
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,645
        this is the view        
        from the bottom.        

59
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,980
          these prongs          
     will eventually connect    

60
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,582
  the headlight to the vehicle. 

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,586
   next, jaws flip the bases.   

62
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,224
         they load them         
     onto a tray on tracks.     

63
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,130
  the tray delivers the plastic 
    bases to a mechanical arm   

64
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,334
  that installs metal retainers 
          on each one.          

65
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,802
    the bases slide forward,    

66
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,938
     and the machine inserts    
   the glass bulbs into them.   

67
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,341
      but it's a loose fit.     

68
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,548
       this machine aligns      
     each bulb to its base.     

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,684
            jaws tilt           
    and slide it into place,    

70
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,620
 then a laser welds it together.

71
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,223
   this alignment is critical.  

72
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,226
     coils for the low-beam     
    and high-beam mechanisms    

73
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,027
  must be precisely positioned  

74
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,698
  for the headlight to project  
        the right light.        

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,968
     next, a series of claws    
       pick up the bulbs.       

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,309
          they dip them         
      in an opaque coating.     

77
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,377
      it's called blacktop      

78
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,913
     because it only covers     
     the tops of the bulbs.     

79
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:22,387
     this will direct light     
  out of the sides of the bulb. 

80
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,923
          now it's time         
    to take these headlights    

81
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,260
 for a test-drive, so to speak. 

82
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,328
    a bracket holds them down   

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,998
while probes underneath energize
  them to make sure they work.  

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,469
    a plunger places a gasket   
        around the base.        

85
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,439
  this will seal the headlight  
   capsule to the automobile.   

86
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:49,081
 and now they're ready to guide 
 you on your nighttime drives.  

87
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,226
   narrator: insulation keeps   
 your home warmer in the winter 

88
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,560
    and cooler in the summer.   

89
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,228
 one type of insulation material

90
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,098
       is cellulose fiber       
    made from recycled paper.   

91
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,168
        it's derived from       
  a natural source, wood fiber, 

92
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,503
      so it's nonpolluting.     

93
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,839
    it contains no asbestos,    
         no fiberglass,         

94
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,974
           and there's          
     no formaldehyde in it,     

95
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,976
  so it doesn't emit any gases. 

96
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,446
like other insulation materials,

97
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,981
   cellulose fiber has to meet  

98
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,116
        strict government       
        safety standards.       

99
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,651
  one firesafety test assesses  

100
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,720
          what's called         
       smolder resistance.      

101
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,790
 the company lab weighs a sample
    from the production line,   

102
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,792
          then inserts          
     a lit cigarette in it.     

103
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,796
  once the cigarette burns out, 
   which takes an hour or two,  

104
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,597
the lab weighs the sample again.

105
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,467
         the weight loss        
     must be less than 15%.     

106
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,872
          how they make         
      cellulose insulation      

107
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,341
     isn't very complicated.    

108
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,778
   it all begins with recycled  
    paper delivered in bulk.    

109
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,836
         workers load it        
      onto a conveyor belt,     

110
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,606
     and from that point on,    
the entire process is automated.

111
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,449
      the paper first goes      

112
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,519
         into a machine         
    called the primary mixer.   

113
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,855
          it separates          
     the bunched-up pieces,     

114
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,590
  preparing them for shredding. 

115
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,600
  the machine's powerful magnet 

116
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,337
 removes staples, paper clips,  
 and any other pieces of metal. 

117
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,222
           from there,          
 the paper goes into a shredder,

118
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,359
    which rips it into pieces   
      about 2 inches long.      

119
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,095
 the factory mixes the shredded 
     paper with boric acid,     

120
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,299
       a natural compound       
 that acts as a fire retardant. 

121
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,035
          it also makes         
 the insulation pest-resistant, 

122
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,439
   and it helps fend off mold,  
   wood decay, and corrosion.   

123
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,374
now a machine called a fiberizer
        shreds the paper        

124
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,912
      into tiny pieces only     
   about 1/8 of an inch long,   

125
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,615
        and it mixes them       
      with more boric acid.     

126
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,457
from the time the recycled paper
        arrives by truck        

127
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,727
           to the time          
      it comes off the line     

128
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,461
 as cellulose-fiber insulation, 

129
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,064
     only about five minutes    
          have passed.          

130
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,134
       but the insulation       
    doesn't leave the factory   

131
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,003
        before undergoing       
    thorough safety testing.    

132
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,474
       this test assesses       
what's called open flammability.

133
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,543
    they heat the insulation    
    to 122 degrees fahrenheit   

134
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,880
  to represent the temperature  
    of a roof in the hot sun.   

135
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,348
      then they ignite it.      

136
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,550
       the flame travels        
       but then dies out,       

137
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,018
    thanks to the boric acid.   

138
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,554
         if that happens        
   within a certain distance,   

139
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,089
     the insulation is safe.    

140
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,492
     outside research firms     
also test the product for safety

141
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,294
  to independently corroborate  

142
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,364
           the results          
     of the company's tests.    

143
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,767
          the automated         
       packaging equipment      

144
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,569
         blows 25 pounds        
    of insulation into a bag,   

145
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,940
  at the same time compressing  
     the fiber into a block.    

146
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,980
some types of thermal insulation

147
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,683
    come as thick rectangular   
    blankets known as batts.    

148
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,723
    you install them by hand,   

149
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,759
       fitting them snugly      
     between the wall studs.    

150
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,662
         cellulose fiber        
     doesn't come in batts.     

151
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,131
           it's known           
    as loose-fill insulation.   

152
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,267
    a professional installer    

153
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,802
        has to inject it        
      in between the walls.     

154
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,537
 by spraying it under pressure, 

155
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,074
     it fills all the spaces    
        without any gaps,       

156
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,876
   something that's hard to do  
     with pre-shaped batts.     

157
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,482
     insulating performance     
   is referred to as r-value.   

158
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,016
     the higher the r-value,    

159
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,187
       the more effective       
         the insulation.        

160
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,293
   cellulose-fiber insulation   
      has a higher r-value      

161
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,828
         than loose-fill        
    mineral-fiber insulation    

162
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,032
     and, depending on which    
  statistics you're looking at, 

163
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,035
   has either the same r-value  
    as loose-fill fiberglass    

164
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,604
       or a higher r-value      
        than fiberglass.        

165
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,579
    cellulose fiber is denser   
      than other materials,     

166
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,982
      so it better resists      
          air movement,         

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,753
  making it less likely to move 
out of place after installation.

168
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,066
  narrator: the aluminum ladder 
       is very convenient.      

169
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,803
     lightweight and sturdy,    
   it makes any ascent easier.  

170
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:15,540
       back in the 1930s,       
wooden ladders were the standard

171
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,544
    but were extremely heavy    
   and difficult to position.   

172
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,014
 the use of aluminum took things
      to a whole new level.     

173
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,951
 for a ladder to really hold up,

174
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,087
       the aluminum needs       
       to be strengthened       

175
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,622
    with these ingredients --   

176
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:34,024
       silicon, magnesium,      

177
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,828
     manganese, and copper.     

178
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,566
           it all goes          
    into an enormous furnace.   

179
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,502
        it takes a crane        
      to transport a hopper     

180
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,038
        full of aluminum        
      over to the furnace.      

181
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,309
        the hopper opens        
    at the bottom to unload.    

182
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,378
      a worker opens a door     
  at the front of the furnace.  

183
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,648
     he wears a face shield     
         to protect him         

184
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,150
       from the blistering      
    1,300 degrees fahrenheit.   

185
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,855
 he adds the other ingredients, 

186
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:07,725
    and the heat turns it all   
       into a liquid mass.      

187
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,595
      the liquid flows out      
  of the furnace into troughs.  

188
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,064
     it seeps through holes     
         in the troughs         

189
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,466
     to molds in the ground.    

190
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,268
  the liquid cools and hardens  
          in the molds.         

191
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,474
 this makes log shapes that are 
    almost 23 feet in length.   

192
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,476
 a hydraulic lift extracts them 
         from the molds         

193
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,313
      and slowly takes them     
      to the next station.      

194
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,217
        you wouldn't want       
        to rush this job.       

195
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,152
         each log weighs        
       about 1,100 pounds,      

196
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,757
        and dropping one        
    could do serious damage.    

197
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,559
  a saw cuts them into pellets. 

198
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,628
       the size depends on      
 the type of ladder being made. 

199
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,032
   a mechanical lift delivers   
 a heated pellet to an extruder,

200
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,434
       and a ram pushes it      
        into the opening.       

201
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,706
     they move the die plate    
         into position.         

202
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,178
  the ram forces the hot pellet 

203
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,780
        through the holes       
        in the die plate.       

204
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,417
     this makes a rail shape    
      about 130 feet long.      

205
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,192
     a puller drags the rail    
          onto a table          

206
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:17,061
      and leaves it to cool     
           and harden.          

207
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,463
  then a circular saw slices it 

208
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,800
   into manageable lengths --   
          19 1/2 feet.          

209
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,269
     operators feed each end    
       of the ladder rail       

210
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,673
  to jaw systems which pull it  
 to make it completely straight.

211
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,288
     the straightened rails     
now move on to the next station,

212
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,357
  where they rivet plastic feet 
          onto the ends         

213
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,494
       to keep the ladder       
         from slipping.         

214
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,965
  they stick safety information 
         onto the rails.        

215
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,902
and now they assemble the ladder
       one step at a time.      

216
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:07,312
      workers fit each step     
in the rims of the ladder rails.

217
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,514
   they rivet them into place.  

218
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,720
     this will be the front     
   of a light-duty stepladder.  

219
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,889
they install a diagonal brace...

220
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,926
   ...and turn the ladder over  

221
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,995
       to rivet the steps       
      from the other side.      

222
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,763
       it's a little more       
         reinforcement.         

223
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,035
  then they build the backside  
       of the stepladder.       

224
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,275
           they rivet           
   the sturdy blue plastic top  

225
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,778
 onto the front and back pieces,
        joining the two.        

226
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,749
    they install a spreader,    

227
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,118
    securing it with rivets,    
            as well.            

228
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,693
     and now this stepladder    

229
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,563
       is ready to provide      
       a little elevation.      

230
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,368
     for a lot of elevation,    
  they make extension ladders.  

231
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,371
      they use round rungs      
      for greater strength.     

232
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,706
       they feed each rung      
      to a coining machine,     

233
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,642
     which tapers the ends.     

234
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,246
     another machine presses    
   aluminum ferrules on rings   

235
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,581
         onto each end.         

236
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,053
      this allows the rungs     
    to fit snugly into slots    

237
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,123
    in the extension ladder's   
           side rails.          

238
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,599
      hydraulic arms reach      
      from above and below      

239
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,968
     to press-fit the rungs     
      into the side rails.      

240
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,479
     finally, workers rivet     
           rubber pads          

241
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,548
   onto the ends of the rails.  

242
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,151
          this provides         
 a firm footing for the ladder. 

243
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,088
 these ladders are now complete.

244
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,690
    and if you're on your way   
        up in the world,        

245
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,492
     they'll come in handy.     

246
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,836
            narrator:           
the bamboo fly rod is a classic.

247
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,172
      the split-bamboo rod      
         has been around        

248
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,973
  since the early 19th century, 

249
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,577
   and for many years, it was   
 the only kind of rod available.

250
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,646
           these days,          
     synthetic rods abound,     

251
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,315
     but bamboo still holds     
      a traditional appeal      

252
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,952
       to those that like       
 to fish the old-fashioned way. 

253
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,655
         going fishing?         

254
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,258
   a bamboo rod is considered   
          a work of art         

255
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,660
     in fly-fishing circles.    

256
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:45,136
 to make one, a craftsman toasts
 a bamboo pole on an open flame.

257
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:50,408
 he holds it close to the fire, 
      but not too close --      

258
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,011
         one false move,        
     and he could scorch it.    

259
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,682
 the goal is to turn the bamboo 
         a golden brown.        

260
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,619
        he pounds a wedge       
     into the toasted bamboo    

261
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,690
          and drives it         
  down the length of the pole.  

262
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,295
    he pulls the pole apart,    
      splitting it in two.      

263
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,697
        then he continues       
      to split the bamboo,      

264
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,902
   making strips that are less  
   than a half-inch in width.   

265
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,908
 he grinds down the bumps on the
  exterior of each bamboo strip 

266
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,410
      using a belt sander.      

267
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,516
         next, it's over        
     to the milling machine.    

268
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,185
     it tapers the underside    
      of the bamboo strip,      

269
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:37,254
beveling it to a 60-degree angle
        from end to end.        

270
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,790
 the tapering is a critical step

271
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,860
        that will affect        
 the rod's casting performance. 

272
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,663
  each strip has to be perfect. 

273
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,667
   the rod maker inspects them  
          for flaws...          

274
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,673
   and then fits six together   
  in a hexagonal configuration. 

275
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,675
 he wraps them with cotton twine

276
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,878
      to hold them together     
    very loosely at one end.    

277
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,355
 then he dips the bamboo strips 
in a tank of thermosetting glue.

278
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,958
          he feeds them         
      to a twining machine      

279
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,561
     which binds the strips     
        tightly together.       

280
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,097
    it's a temporary wrap --    
         a kind of clamp        

281
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,566
   to hold the pieces together  
      while the glue dries.     

282
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,235
         the pieces are         
     now laminated into one,    

283
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,238
        but the result is       
    never perfectly straight,   

284
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,976
    so the rod maker heats it   
       over an open flame.      

285
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,947
   the heat softens the bamboo  
 so he can smooth out the kinks.

286
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:43,588
     next, he glues ferrules    
     made from nickel silver    

287
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,624
       onto the laminated       
         bamboo pieces.         

288
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,729
    this tubing will be used    

289
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,265
       to connect the tip       
   and butt pieces of the rod.  

290
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:57,000
        the butt section        
      now turns on a lathe      

291
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,269
   while a blade cuts into it.  

292
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,338
   it's slimming down sections  

293
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,874
    to accommodate the handle   
         and reel seat.         

294
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,145
he slips on the walnut reel seat

295
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,816
   and then slides cork rings   
onto the rod to make the handle.

296
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,386
       he glues each ring.      

297
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,623
        it takes 12 to 14       

298
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,627
        to make a handle        
   for the typical bamboo rod.  

299
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:27,231
          it will allow         
    for a soft, nonslip grip.   

300
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,968
     once the glue hardens,     
 he shapes the cork on a lathe. 

301
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:39,843
           he sands it          
     to give an even finish.    

302
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,247
       next, he heats glue      
          over a flame.         

303
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,983
     he applies the hot glue    
   to the stainless-steel tip   

304
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,520
 and sticks it on the narrow end
           of the rod.          

305
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,193
      with black india ink,     

306
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,665
     he inscribes the model     
 and serial number onto the rod.

307
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:05,770
 now they coat it with varnish, 
     using a turkey baster.     

308
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,874
    he hangs the rods to dry.   

309
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,878
    it will take three coats    
   to give them a nice gloss.   

310
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,347
           after that,          
      they wind silk thread     

311
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,949
   to attach the steel guides   
           to the rod.          

312
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,852
   they're the loops that the   
  fishing line will go through. 

313
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:29,760
     they brush three coats     
   of varnish onto the string.  

314
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,296
   this solidifies the wrap...  

315
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,035
   ...and fuses it to the rod.  

316
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,971
        they slide a ring       
       onto the reel seat.      

317
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:45,509
 it provides a little separation
       from the cork grip.      

318
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,649
they fit the butt and tip pieces
   of the bamboo rod together   

319
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,684
   and do a final inspection.   

320
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,524
      it has taken 40 hours     
  to make this bamboo fly rod.  

321
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,531
    but it shouldn't take you   
 that long to catch the big one.

322
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,871
