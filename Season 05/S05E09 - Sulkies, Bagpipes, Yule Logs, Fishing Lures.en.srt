narrator: today on "how it's made"...     

2
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,561
sulkies...           

3
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,866
bagpipes...          

4
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,171
yule logs...          

5
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,777
and fishing lures.       

6
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,720
in the sport of harness racing,

7
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,122
the horse, known as a standardbred,    

8
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,124
pulls its driver in a sulky.  

9
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,593
a sulky is a cart on two wheels

10
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,596
that attaches to each side of the horse's harness.    

11
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:07,732
it has to be sturdy enough to withstand the rough ride,  

12
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,802
but it also has to be lightweight     

13
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,204
so that it won't slow the horse down.        

14
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,476
step one in sulky production  

15
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,814
is to cut an aluminum tube 1 1/2 inches in diameter    

16
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,881
for the frame.         

17
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,883
most of the parts are aluminum 

18
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,019
because it's a lightweight metal.      

19
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,488
using a manually operated tube bender,          

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,291
workers shape the angles of the sulky's shaft,     

21
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,726
the piece that attaches to the harness.        

22
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,365
now they weld together the eight aluminum parts    

23
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,501
that make up the sulky's frame.

24
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:46,004
all this welding takes approximately 2 1/2 hours.   

25
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,375
once that's done,       

26
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,777
they insert the shaft into the bridge        

27
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,246
on which the driver sits,   

28
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,715
making sure they align with each other.        

29
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,183
next come the clamps --    

30
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,986
3-inch-long steel pieces with a hole on each end.    

31
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,990
they fasten certain non-welded parts of the sulky together.  

32
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,992
each clamp starts off straight.

33
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,128
a worker mounts it on a machine
called the bender,       

34
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:14,066
then pulls the lever almost 360 degrees to curve it.    

35
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,151
next a tool called a multipress drill       

36
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,153
fashions the aluminum flange --

37
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,689
the part of the wheel hub to which the spokes attach.  

38
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,960
the multipress has six bits.  

39
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,831
it rotates three times to drill
a total of 18 holes.      

40
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,568
the flange has another nine holes to remove weight  

41
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,570
and six smaller holes to which a plastic wheel protector   

42
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,173
will later attach.       

43
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,177
now they position the flange on the aluminum hub      

44
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,313
and hammer it on snugly.    

45
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,915
they do this using a tool called a punch         

46
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,918
to avoid leaving impact marks. 

47
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,920
next, a sleeve goes inside the hub,      

48
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,191
and the bearing goes in between the two.    

49
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,192
again, with the help of a punch,

50
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,795
they knock on the bearing snugly.     

51
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,065
finally, they install a cap  

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,268
to prevent dust from getting in
and causing damage.      

53
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,770
the hub is now complete,    

54
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,839
and it took only about five minutes to assemble.   

55
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,276
now they attach aluminum spokes,

56
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,945
18 of them on each side of the wheel.   

57
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,015
every spoke attaches to the flange on one end    

58
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,618
and to an aluminum rim on the other.         

59
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:45,757
workers hand-tighten a nipple on the rim end of each spoke. 

60
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,492
the nipples are made of brass 

61
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,695
because it resists rust quite well.        

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,631
it's essential to tighten all the nipples equally    

63
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,367
to ensure the wheel will be properly aligned.   

64
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,970
after tightening them further with the screwdriver,     

65
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,307
on goes some rim tape, then the tube and tire.    

66
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:10,982
they pump up the tube with up to 78 pounds of air.  

67
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,652
then they install a plastic protector disc.   

68
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,387
this prevents competing horses 

69
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,990
from putting their hooves through the spokes.      

70
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,593
meanwhile, the sulky has been sandblasted,     

71
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,061
painted, and decorated.    

72
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,864
now it's time to put stirrups on the shafts.         

73
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,666
these aluminum and stainless-steel fittings  

74
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,135
on the end of the shafts    

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,205
are what attach the sulky to the horse's harness.    

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,806
should the harness break,   

77
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,142
a backup safety strap on each shaft         

78
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,611
keeps the sulky attached to the horse.     

79
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,080
now they fasten a padded leather seat     

80
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,883
to an aluminum plate mounted on the bridge.     

81
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,953
on each side, they attach the wheel to the bridge    

82
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,220
with a simple axle.      

83
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,757
even though these look like bicycle wheels,        

84
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,693
they're stronger and far more durable.     

85
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,630
next, they assemble what's called the tree --   

86
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,566
the rigid stainless-steel structure   

87
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,969
that goes on the horse's back. 

88
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,104
the outer part is made of plastic.      

89
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,439
they stitch velcro to the underside.       

90
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,443
to that, they attach a nylon-covered foam padding  

91
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,245
that protects the horse's back from irritation.        

92
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,716
the finished harness with all its hooks and turrets 

93
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,850
weighs 10 pounds.       

94
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,921
it's taken 20 hours to make.  

95
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,590
this is what's called a quick-hitch fitting.     

96
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,460
it hooks on to the fitting on the end of each shaft,   

97
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,929
tying the sulky to the horse's harness.    

98
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,402
a sulky takes 40 hours to assemble.          

99
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,906
it weighs between just 50 and 60 pounds.     

100
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,410
harness racing is one of the few sports       

101
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:49,314
where being a lightweight is key
to a good track record.    

102
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,693
narrator: the bagpipe is one of the oldest instruments.   

103
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,562
to play it, you blow into a pipe

104
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,964
attached to a leather or synthetic bag,       

105
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,567
then press on the bag to force the air out      

106
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,836
through other pipes to create sound.        

107
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,104
you transform this sound into a melody         

108
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,708
using finger holes on a reeded pipe called a chanter.     

109
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,113
[ bagpipe music plays ]    

110
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,658
they start by carving an 8-inch-long block of wood, 

111
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,193
rounding it to a diameter   

112
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,529
of a little more than 1 1/2 inches.       

113
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,997
it's part of a drone --    

114
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,800
one of three on the bagpipe that
create bass and tenor harmonies.

115
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,538
they drill a hole that will later become an air channel.  

116
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,280
using a lathe and a plastic template as a guide,      

117
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,816
a craftsman spins the wood to carve it,          

118
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,818
a process called turning.   

119
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,821
the lathe has a stationary carbide-tip cutter       

120
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,892
strong and precise enough to cut
this hard african blackwood.  

121
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:11,362
it's a very heavy and dry wood,
perfect for turning.      

122
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,765
for more intricate, decorative cuts,        

123
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,968
he uses a handheld device called a combing tool.     

124
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,840
next, he uses what's called a parting-off tool       

125
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,975
to make additional decorative grooves.      

126
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,645
he measures these grooves using a caliper        

127
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,848
to ensure they meet the specifications of the design. 

128
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,986
the craftsman drills a hole  

129
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,789
to create what's called a projecting mount.      

130
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,126
it's made of imitation ivory, and at 2 inches in diameter,  

131
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,595
it fits on the drone like a washer.         

132
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,665
but it's just for decoration --
one of seven on the bagpipe.  

133
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:52,003
he adds a metal component called
a slide, also for decoration. 

134
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,073
next, he turns what's called a blowpipe.          

135
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:59,277
this one's made of plastic to withstand moisture from saliva.

136
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,814
traditionalists prefer blowpipes
made of wood.         

137
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,285
he adds a mouthpiece.     

138
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,554
it retracts by almost eight inches,         

139
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,623
depending on the player's height.      

140
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,825
the player blows into the mouthpiece      

141
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,495
to inflate the bag.      

142
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,963
a small metal tube between two plastic blades   

143
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,231
forms the chanter reed.    

144
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,366
when air strikes it,      

145
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,435
the reed vibrates inside the chanter --     

146
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,637
a pipe at the bottom of the instrument       

147
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,639
that has eight finger holes for notes           

148
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,908
and two for pitch adjustment. 

149
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,975
to secure it,         

150
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,645
the craftsman wraps the reed with hemp string        

151
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,047
and winds teflon tape over the string        

152
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,182
for an airtight seal.     

153
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,852
then a brass wire called a bridle        

154
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,321
to control the shape of the reed.          

155
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,258
narrowing the opening produces a higher-pitched sound.    

156
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,595
the craftsman ties hemp string to create traction       

157
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,898
between the drone segments, holding them together.     

158
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,934
hemp string is especially durable,      

159
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,803
yet easily replaced if damaged.

160
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,940
here's the completed tenor drone.          

161
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,743
next, the craftsman inserts what's called a stock     

162
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,346
through the zippered opening of the pipe bag.        

163
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,349
the pipe bag's made of a synthetic, breathable material.

164
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,151
the five stocks fit through a rubber collar in the bag,  

165
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:18,056
attaching to the three drones, the chanter, and the blowpipe. 

166
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,361
the craftsman inserts the chanter through a sleeve  

167
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,163
in the bottom of the pipe bag. 

168
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,500
he secures it with string, tightening it around the bag. 

169
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,269
he closes the zipper to form an airtight seal.       

170
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,641
next, he places the pipe bag  

171
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,310
into a decorative velveteen bag cover.      

172
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,912
he inserts the stocks through holes         

173
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,382
trimmed with wool or silk fringe.        

174
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,651
a rubber valve prevents the player's air   

175
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,853
from coming back up through the blowpipe,     

176
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:52,857
channeling it through the chanter instead.      

177
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,260
another part, called a drone reed,      

178
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,128
acts like a plastic tongue.  

179
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,930
it vibrates over a long hole  

180
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,599
to create the bagpipe's humming sound.         

181
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,869
the craftsman inserts the drone reed into the drone 

182
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,405
and then into its stock.    

183
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,809
wool cords keep the drones   
in place while the player plays.

184
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,179
finally, the craftsman fits the chanter reed     

185
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,750
into the chanter, then slides it into its stock. 

186
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,086
a bagpiper must have a strong set of lungs     

187
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,423
because some songs can run for 20 minutes.    

188
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,626
now<i> that's</i> long-winded.

narrator: a yule log is a traditional dessert    

191
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,764
for reveillant,        

192
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,799
the christmas-eve meal that follows midnight mass   

193
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,069
in france and other french-speaking countries.   

194
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,871
it's a rolled sponge cake covered in chocolate frosting 

195
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,340
and decorated to look like a tree log.          

196
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,043
it's supposed to represent a real yule log,        

197
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,480
the burning of which was once a popular christmas ritual.  

198
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,752
this company uses vanilla or chocolate ice cream     

199
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,020
instead of frosting.      

200
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,422
the cake itself is chocolate sponge cake.   

201
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,158
workers start by making chocolate cake batter     

202
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,960
in a machine called a liquefier.

203
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,831
they add flavoring, exactly what
is a trade secret,       

204
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,233
and liquid eggs...

...and cocoa.         

210
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,992
after mixing the batter for 20 minutes,        

211
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,261
a machine called the cake depositor       

212
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,063
pumps it into a 13-gallon vat. 

213
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,066
the cake depositor distributes the batter evenly       

214
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,468
through nozzles spaced 3 1/2 inches apart.      

215
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,472
then it spreads the batter onto brown craft paper     

216
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,274
that's a little more than three feet wide.     

217
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,210
the paper's waxed so the cake won't stick after baking.   

218
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,813
the machine funnels the batter into an even layer       

219
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,150
that's 1/4 of an inch thick and 36 inches wide.      

220
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:35,553
workers make between 8,000 to 10,000 yule logs daily,   

221
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,154
depending on the size.     

222
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,891
after baking for seven minutes at 500 degrees fahrenheit,   

223
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,029
a conveyor moves the cake out of
the oven at six feet per minute.

224
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:49,767
next, a circular saw separates the cake right down the middle.

225
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,170
every 17 seconds, another blade,

226
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,706
appropriately called a guillotine, drops down,   

227
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,008
slicing the cake into smaller segments.     

228
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:03,180
a machine pours strawberry jam 
onto a thick layer of ice cream.

229
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,582
this creates three layers,   

230
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,518
including the cake slab underneath.          

231
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,321
the factory goes through more than 4,000 pounds of jam    

232
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,591
and 3,000 gallons of ice cream per 8-hour shift.       

233
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,060
a worker gently separates the cake slabs,        

234
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,996
leaving about three inches of excess ice cream and jam,  

235
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,465
which is thrown away.     

236
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,336
she then separates the cake from the craft paper      

237
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,605
by folding the cake onto itself once,       

238
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,807
then rolling the cake, ice cream,           

239
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,276
and jam layers together.    

240
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,810
watch closely and you'll see  

241
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,480
that she doesn't touch the cake,
only the paper.        

242
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,082
she wears rubber gloves to prevent her hands      

243
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,617
from sticking to the paper.  

244
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,622
the worker rolls the cake into a machine called a slicer.

245
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,692
it cuts the cake into three 8-inch-long segments      

246
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,028
called logs.          

247
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,364
the slicer deposits the logs into plastic trays.      

248
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,369
another machine now decorates with ice cream.        

249
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,172
it covers the surface as well as the ends.      

250
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,443
the ice cream decorations are lace and floral designs.  

251
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,324
now for the embellishments.  

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,195
workers place two candied   
maraschino cherries on each log.

253
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,265
then a machine drizzles on bits of maple sugar      

254
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,001
as another worker cuts the connecting ice cream,   

255
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,669
separating the logs.      

256
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,005
this factory uses maple sugar bits        

257
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,675
instead of nuts on its logs out of concern for allergies. 

258
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,015
next, a plastic poinsettia on each log.          

259
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,818
then, a plastic "joyeuses fêtes,"       

260
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,922
which is french for "happy holidays."     

261
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,831
a conveyor belt moves the logs 

262
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,567
through a machine called a co2 tunnel.      

263
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,369
inside, sprayers blast the logs
with a mist          

264
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,238
that instantly freezes them.  

265
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,973
this mist is carbon dioxide  

266
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,177
refrigerated to minus 185 degrees fahrenheit. 

267
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,181
five minutes in the co2 tunnel superfreezes the outer layer  

268
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,384
so workers can handle it easily.

269
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,059
a wrapping machine covers the logs        

270
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,628
in a clear plastic film.    

271
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,274
then another machine simultaneously         

272
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,345
cuts and heat-seals the plastic,
enclosing the logs in bags.  

273
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,547
finally, a worker packs the bags
into boxes for shipping.    

274
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,517
the factory stores the boxes in its warehouse freezers   

275
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,486
at minus 95 degrees fahrenheit.

276
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,422
then, as christmas approaches, 

277
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,957
these holiday desserts go out to the stores,     

278
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,627
where they sell for $5 to $8 each.       

279
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,235
narrator: if you take your fishing seriously,    

280
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,571
chances are you're hooked on lures.    

281
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,907
if worm bait is like hamburger,

282
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,043
then lures are like filet mignon.     

283
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,380
they attract fish by either mimicking the food they like --

284
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,482
impersonating a minnow, for example --         

285
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,584
or by reflecting light.    

286
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,593
lures come in many shapes and sizes.     

287
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,461
they can measure up to a foot long       

288
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,665
and weigh as much as 3/4 of a pound.       

289
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,669
they're usually made of brass. 

290
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,538
this model is from a brass sheet

291
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,074
that's less than 3/100 of an inch thick.       

292
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,611
it goes into a press that's outfitted with a series of dies

293
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,280
to progressively cut and shape the lures,      

294
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,549
turning out 2,000 of them per hour.           

295
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,618
this looks like one fast operation,      

296
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,087
but it's really four consecutive steps.    

297
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,557
the first die stamps the company
name and lure model number,  

298
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,226
punches a slot down the middle,

299
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,360
and punctures a hole on each end.          

300
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,496
the second die scores the outline.      

301
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,498
the third cuts it out.     

302
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,236
the fourth and final die forms the piece into a spoon shape, 

303
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,506
which is why this type of lure is called a spoon.       

304
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,076
this shape makes it move in the water like a small fish.

305
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,314
that blue object at the bottom right is an air jet.      

306
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,052
it blows the lures coming off 
the press into a collection bin.

307
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,456
lures vary in size, shape, and texture,      

308
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,792
and plating them in different metals      

309
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,327
creates reflective effects in the water.         

310
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,130
all these factors determine the type of fish   

311
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,331
the lures attract.       

312
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,468
the metal-plating process is called electroplating    

313
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,137
because electricity is the key to it all.           

314
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,738
workers wire up the lures,   

315
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,074
submerge them in an acid solution,      

316
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,743
then run a negative current through them.         

317
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,847
they run a positive current to the plating metal,     

318
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,615
in this case, copper nuggets. 

319
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,285
the acid dissolves the copper into particles         

320
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,952
laced with a positive charge. 

321
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,689
this draws them to the negative-charged lures,  

322
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,358
which they coat in an even layer of copper.  

323
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,498
after a thorough rinse,    

324
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,568
the racks go into the next tank
for nickel-plating,      

325
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,037
then another rinse and into another tank     

326
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,574
for silver-plating -- the final finish.       

327
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,910
silver-plating requires    
undercoats of copper and nickel.

328
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,379
to prevent the silver from tarnishing,        

329
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,648
workers coat the lures in clear lacquer,       

330
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,785
using the same plating process.

331
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,255
lures plated in 24-karat gold don't need lacquering     

332
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,324
because gold doesn't tarnish. 

333
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,936
now for the cosmetics.     

334
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:02,673
one way to decorate the lure is
by what's called pad printing. 

335
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,343
an automated machine applies ink
to a metal plate        

336
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,544
with a design etched into it. 

337
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,215
a silicone pad stamps the plate,
picking up the design,     

338
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,018
then stamps the lure, transferring it.        

339
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,222
this is a 2-color design, so there are two pads at work. 

340
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,959
it's quick-dry ink, so the colors don't smudge.  

341
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,429
another way to decorate lures is to apply decals.      

342
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,498
they adhere with waterproof glue

343
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,668
that's specially designed for the fishing industry.   

344
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,777
after decorating, workers attach a 3-pronged hook --   

345
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,846
a treble hook -- to a split ring.        

346
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,048
that's the ring at both ends of the lure    

347
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,052
to which the fishing line and the hook will be attached. 

348
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,254
some models have decorated hooks,     

349
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,922
known as dressed hooks.    

350
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,857
the idea is to add a color accent         

351
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,327
to make the lure look more like
the fishes' prey.       

352
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,795
to do this,          

353
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,798
they first wind a nylon thread around the shaft of the hook, 

354
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,400
then trim off the loose end.  

355
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,070
next, they lay together two different-colored hackles. 

356
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,339
hackles are the filaments of a rooster's neck feathers. 

357
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,675
they wrap them around the shaft of the hook     

358
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,611
on top of the nylon thread.  

359
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,480
the different-colored feathers blend together.        

360
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,016
the filaments project from the head of the hook   

361
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,484
to disguise it.        

362
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,687
workers wrap them with more nylon thread     

363
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,956
to secure them in place.    

364
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,564
here, a decal is applied to a different style of lure  

365
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,598
called a spinner        

366
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,767
because it spins like a disco ball,       

367
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,803
reflecting light to attract a fish.       

368
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,976
the final step is to attach the hook to the lure.     

369
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,446
depending on its complexity and number of platings,    

370
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,183
a lure takes between 45 minutes
and two hours to make.     

371
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,853
that's a lot of specialized time and effort for fish bait 

372
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,256
that's nothing short of alluring.
