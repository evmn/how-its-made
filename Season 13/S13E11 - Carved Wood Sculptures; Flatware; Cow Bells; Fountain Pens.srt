00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,121
     narrator: val gardena,     
  a valley in the italian alps, 

4
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,056
  is renowned for woodcarving.  

5
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,058
     this craft began there     
       in the 17th century      

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,195
as a way to pass the time during
   the long mountain winters.   

7
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,798
      at first, woodcarvers     
      made practical items,     

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,199
        but before long,        

9
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,169
      their masterful hands     
   were creating works of art.  

10
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,943
      from pastoral scenes      
      to religious themes,      

11
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,413
   these magnificently carved   
         wood sculptures        

12
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,148
      seem almost lifelike.     

13
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,285
   after sketching the figure   
            on paper,           

14
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,621
       the carver sculpts       
    a three-dimensional model   

15
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:30,790
   from a block of plasticine.  

16
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,961
         using his hands        
     and an array of tools,     

17
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:39,098
    he meticulously fashions    
    all the intricate details   

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,233
 he'll later re-create in wood. 

19
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,438
  for this flute-playing angel, 

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,641
     he positions a replica     
        of the instrument       

21
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,109
  to get the angle of her arms  

22
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,878
    and opening of her hands    
           just right.          

23
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,918
next, using the plasticine model
         as a reference,        

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,320
      he draws the figure       
      onto a block of wood      

25
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,923
   roughly the size and shape   
        of the sculpture.       

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
   using a mallet and chisels,  

27
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,397
     he begins chipping away    
      at the block of wood.     

28
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:15,000
    this is stone pine wood,    
    a rare species that grows   

29
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,336
 in the higher mountain valleys 
          of the alps.          

30
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:21,207
      pine is a soft wood,      
   so it's ideal for carving.   

31
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,422
       when it comes time       
      for the finer work --     

32
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,357
       carving the details      
and smoothing out the surface --

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,694
           he switches          
    to a fine paring chisel.    

34
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,777
  from the finished wood model, 
 the factory casts a bronze copy

35
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:03,048
 to use for producing the final 
 sculptures out of maple wood.  

36
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,718
     when the maple planks      
     arrive at the factory,     

37
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,052
      their moisture level,     

38
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,455
   as this hydrometer reading   
             shows,             

39
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,124
          is typically          
      between 70% and 80%.      

40
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,060
     if they carve the wood     
     while it's still wet,      

41
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,062
          the sculpture         
     would eventually crack,    

42
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,199
   so they load the wood into   
 a giant dryer for about a week 

43
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,636
   to bring the moisture down   
         to an ideal 6%.        

44
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,606
     when the wood comes out    
          of the dryer,         

45
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,008
     they trim off the bark     
       with a circular saw      

46
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,345
        then cut off all        
but the best part in the middle.

47
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:40,219
  they trim those middle pieces 
       into uniform blocks      

48
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,888
      just slightly larger      
 than the size of the sculpture.

49
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,359
   20 blocks at a time go onto  
 a machine called a pantograph, 

50
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,563
      a sharp carving head      
        over each block.        

51
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:55,901
   those 20 carving heads are   
 linked to a blunt master head. 

52
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,170
    a technician slowly moves   
        this master head        

53
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,106
         over every inch        
      of the bronze model.      

54
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:03,708
 this simultaneously manipulates
      the 20 carving heads      

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,045
to shape their respective blocks

56
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,848
  into fairly unrefined copies  
          of the model          

57
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,950
        in half the size.       

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,055
   the machine can't reproduce  
        the fine details,       

59
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,924
     so the original carver     
   returns to personally carve  

60
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,960
    each and every sculpture    
         to completion.         

61
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,332
     by the time he's done,     

62
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:32,338
 what once was an ordinary block
 of wood is forever transformed.

63
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,608
        now the sculpture       
        truly comes alive       

64
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,879
      in the talented hands     
          of an artist.         

65
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,482
 with her palette of oil paints,
   she dresses the bare wood,   

66
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,951
       alternating between      
        different brushes       

67
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,020
   to create varying textures.  

68
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,130
  technique is everything here. 

69
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,233
   she must apply enough paint  

70
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,703
     to cover the bare wood     
 and enhance the craftsmanship, 

71
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,239
  yet not apply too much paint. 

72
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,575
         otherwise, this        
  exquisitely carved sculpture  

73
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,410
 could look like cheap plastic. 

74
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,587
      once the paint dries,     

75
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,590
     they glue a metal disk     
     with the company name      

76
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,592
   into a hole under the base.  

77
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:30,061
   then they package the piece  
    with protective wrapping    

78
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,264
        and a certificate       
         of authenticity        

79
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:35,601
     that guarantees this is    
 a genuine carved-wood sculpture

80
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:38,237
    from val gardena, italy.    

81
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,755
            narrator:           
    throughout the centuries,   

82
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:00,292
  man fashioned eating utensils 
     out of various metals.     

83
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,095
   the 1840s saw the invention  
        of silver plating       

84
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,297
  over inexpensive base metals. 

85
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,299
sterling silver and silver plate

86
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,169
        remained the norm       
     until the early 1950s,     

87
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:13,405
  when stainless-steel flatware 
         made its debut.        

88
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,711
    stainless steel flatware    
           is durable           

89
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,246
    and, unlike silver plate,   

90
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,782
     doesn't dull, tarnish,     
          or wear off.          

91
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:29,521
    this flatware starts out    
   as thick wire called coil.   

92
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:33,591
    to make knives, the coil    
   goes into a heading machine  

93
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,728
        that cuts pieces        
        to blade length,        

94
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,729
         then forms them        
        into blank shapes       

95
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,531
     with a head at one end.    

96
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,133
  this bolster, as it's called, 

97
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:45,070
     will connect the blade     
      to the knife handle.      

98
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,872
   a furnace softens the metal  

99
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,308
      for the final shaping     
       in a forging press.      

100
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,346
           three dies           
  progressively forge the shape 

101
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,782
 and trim off the excess metal. 

102
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,424
         after grinding         
  the end of the bolster flat,  

103
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,960
        the next machine        
       welds on the tang,       

104
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,263
           which fits           
    inside the knife handle.    

105
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,834
 now an automated grinding wheel

106
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,970
        tapers the blade        
      thinner at the front.     

107
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,641
    a second grinding wheel     
    scallops the front edge.    

108
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,711
 this is the knife's serration. 

109
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:28,580
      the thicker back end      
    gives the blade strength    

110
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,283
    to withstand the pressure   
  you apply when cutting food.  

111
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,322
     for the knife handles,     

112
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,592
the factory uses stainless steel
  with a higher nickel content. 

113
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,594
         it has greater         
      corrosion resistance      

114
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,197
     and is easier to form,     
       which is critical,       

115
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,267
given that handles often feature
     very intricate designs.    

116
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,337
 handles, too, start out as coil

117
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,040
        that goes through       
        a series of dies.       

118
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,413
       each finished piece      
        is half a handle.       

119
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,616
     a spot-welding machine     
 tacks the two halves together, 

120
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,018
     forming a handle shell.    

121
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,488
 to fuse the halves completely, 

122
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,224
        this machine cuts       
  a piece of copper-based wire  

123
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,560
       and drops it inside      
       the hollow handle.       

124
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,898
    a furnace melts the wire    

125
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,835
    so that it flows into the   
 crevice between the two halves,

126
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,037
 soldering the seam thoroughly. 

127
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,110
       an etching machine       
     grinds the solder line     

128
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:34,113
     until it blends in with    
the surrounding stainless steel.

129
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,856
   workers pour liquid cement   
  into the center of a carousel 

130
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,992
       on which they mount      
      50 handles at a time.     

131
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,327
     as the carousel spins,     

132
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,330
      the centrifugal force     
   shoots the cement outward,   

133
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,800
  filling the handle cavities.  

134
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,269
   then workers insert a blade  
         into each one.         

135
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,875
  a 10-minute soak in hot water 
        cures the cement.       

136
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,650
  workers scrub off any excess  
     cement that oozed out.     

137
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,221
       on the spoon line,       
   a press cuts standard steel  

138
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,356
 into paintbrush-shaped pieces. 

139
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,293
       then heavy rollers       
    stretch those pieces out,   

140
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,031
        thinning the end        
that'll become the spoon's bowl.

141
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:29,168
     a trim press then cuts     
      the spoon's profile.      

142
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,643
         next, a machine        
     called a coining press     

143
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,312
       punches the pattern      
         into the handle        

144
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,782
       then forms the bowl      
      to its rounded shape.     

145
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,926
        forks go through        
    the same steps as spoons    

146
00:09:54,928 --> 00:10:00,064
 then through a press that cuts 
    the tines in two stages.    

147
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,333
          a support bar         
  keeps the tines from moving,  

148
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,203
      while a coining press     
   puts a slight bend in them.  

149
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,473
        the next machine        
       slices off that bar      

150
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,943
 and stacks the finished forks. 

151
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,283
          the last stop         
      for all the flatware      

152
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,818
    is the buffing equipment.   

153
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,890
 cloth wheels polish the surface
  with liquid buffing compound  

154
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,025
     until the steel shines.    

155
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:35,500
       the casual patterns      
  are now ready for packaging.  

156
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,569
      the more formal ones      
         get dressed up         

157
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:41,607
  with full or partial plating  
       in silver or gold.

00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,658
            narrator:           
    in the swiss countryside,   

159
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,662
         the cowbell is         
 a traditional sight and sound. 

160
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,598
           at roundup,          
   as the cows start walking,   

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,668
        their bells clang       
 and wake up the sleeping cows, 

162
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,603
 telling them it's time to move.

163
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,472
      at pasture, if a cow      
   wanders off from the herd,   

164
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,943
   its bell alerts the farmer.

        [ bells dinging ]       

166
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:24,549
    swiss cowbells also play    
       a ceremonial roll.       

167
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,285
       farmers adorn their      
   prize livestock with them.

169
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,358
 the greater the farmer's pride 
         in the animal.         

170
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,494
         finer cowbells         
      are made by artisans,     

171
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,963
  like this one in switzerland. 

172
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:40,899
 he starts by laying a template 
       on a sheet of steel      

173
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,503
that's 2 to 3 millimeters thick,
 depending on the type of bell. 

174
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,239
     with the plasma cutter,    
       he cuts two pieces.      

175
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,374
  each will form half the bell. 

176
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,915
 while each piece is still flat,
      he engraves a design      

177
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:00,185
         using a hammer         
  and burins of various sizes.  

178
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,555
    a burin is handled blade    
       with a beveled tip.      

179
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,528
      next, he heats a spot     

180
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,465
      then stamps his logo      
       and the bell size,       

181
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:17,336
            according           
  to a swiss numbering system.  

182
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:20,606
 next stop, a gas-fired furnace.

183
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:24,142
the 1,800-degree-fahrenheit heat
       softens the metal,       

184
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,645
       which he then lays       
       in a forging press.      

185
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,918
    the press closes, shaping   
 the piece into half a cowbell. 

186
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,356
     he repeats this process    
       with a second piece      

187
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:40,025
     to make the other half.    

188
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,427
         then he refines        
     the shape and thickness    

189
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,496
   using a variety of hammers.  

190
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,167

        into a half-bell        

191
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,303
    made lines on the sides.    

192
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:55,274
      he now welds and then     
    grinds those seams flat.    

193
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,847
   he hammers every centimeter  
        of each bell half       

194
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,349
 to refine and purify the sound.

195
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,455
        it's time to weld       
    the two halves together.    

196
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:15,527
     he tacks them in place     
   then welds the entire seam.  

197
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,598
later, he'll grind the weld line
 flush with the bell's surface. 

198
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,670
  next, he welds a steel handle 
     to the top of the bell.    

199
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,405
this will hold the leather strap

200
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,841
     from which the cowbell     
           will hang.           

201
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:36,814
       beneath the handle,      
         on the inside,         

202
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,818
   he welds on a v-shaped rod   
       to hold the battle,      

203
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,221
the swinging hammer that strikes
     the bell's inner walls.    

204
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,425
          on each side,         

205
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,961
 he pierces two holes for rivets

206
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,865
     where the bell halves      
     cross over each other.     

207
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,101
with a torch and a forging tool,

208
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:59,004
    he shapes each top rivet    
   until it's nice and round.   

209
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,041
         then he hammers        
     each bottom rivet flat     

210
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,077
   to make them unnoticeable.   

211
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,252
  here he melts a brass bullet  
      casing riveted area.      

212
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,788
   that white powder is borax,  

213
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,591
      a mineral that helps      
     the soldering process.     

214
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:22,660
 adding this little bit of brass
       solidifies the fold      

215
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,864
          and improves          
    the bell's sound quality.   

216
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,800
   the cowbell's construction   
        is now complete.        

217
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,802
            however,            
  all that forging and welding  

218
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,538
       has left dark spots      
          on the steel.         

219
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,674
      so, the bell now goes     
       for a 15-hour bath       

220
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,010
      in hydrochloric acid.     

221
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,447
  this cleaning makes the bell  
      even-toned and shiny.     

222
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:49,154
       a thorough washing       
    removes the acid residue.   

223
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,761
     then it's into a basin     
       of sawdust to dry.       

224
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:00,265
     sawdust absorbs water      
     faster than cloths do.     

225
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,503
    the engraved decorations    

226
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,039
       don't show up well       
      on the shiny surface,     

227
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,242
   so the artisan brushes acid  
       on strategic spots       

228
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:14,880
 to oxidize the steel and create
     the illusion of relief.    

229
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,651
    it takes tremendous skill   
   to milk a beautiful cowbell  

230
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,188
       out of an ordinary       
         sheet of steel.        

231
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,123
        but there's still       
  the decorative leather strap, 

232
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,794
        which is the job        
        of a saddlemaker.

235
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,271
  others elaborately decorated  
  with baked-on enamel colors.

   a fine, handcrafted cowbell  

237

   will last for generations.

   narrator: the fountain pen   
      was invented in 1884.     

239
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,966
    until then, people wrote    
   with quills or steel pens,   

240
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,902
 which required repeated dipping
       in a bottle of ink.      

241
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,838
        the fountain pen        
        was revolutionary       

242
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,574
   because it held its own ink  
    in a built-in reservoir.    

243
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,510
     discriminating writers     
 still consider the fountain pen

00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,946
the ultimate writing instrument.

       called the barrel,

249
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,927
     for filling the barrel.    

250
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,229
       this one is called       
        the filler pump.        

251
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,265
  it works just like a syringe. 

252
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,467
      you unscrew the end,      
  which draws a piston upward,  

253
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,936
        creating a vacuum       
     that sucks up the ink.     

254
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,008
         when you write,        

255
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,476
      the ink flows through     
    a speed-regulating feeder   

256
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,612
     to the nib of the pen.     

257
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,482
nibs are made of stainless steel

258
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,752
 or, in luxury pens like these, 
           solid gold.          

259
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:07,825
        to make the nib,        
rollers flatten a piece of gold.

260
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,161
      then a press cuts out     
        a starting shape,       

261
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,763
    with a stress-relief hole   

262
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,898
  to keep the nib from cracking 
         when it flexes.        

263
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,569
    another press stamps the    
 caret marking and company name 

264
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,238
      then bends the piece      
      to its final shape.       

265
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,242
  a worker cuts the ink pathway 

266
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,746
  using a diamond cutting wheel 
   thinner than a human hair.   

267
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,118
    to fortify the nib's tip,   

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,787
       this machine welds       
   on a tiny glob of iridium,   

269
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,223
         a durable metal        
     in the platinum family.    

270
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:49,200
  workers grind the iridium tip 
  to a precise size and shape.  

271
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,836
      this is what dictates     
the thickness of the pen's line,

272
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,805
       from fine to broad,      

273
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,608
      and the line's style,     
   such as italic or oblique.   

274
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,744
   polishing is the final stop  
         on the journey         

275
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,848
    from plain piece of gold    
         to ornate nib.         

276
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,022
  the feeder that transfers ink 
  from the reservoir to the nib 

277
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,491
is made from a cylindrical piece
           of ebonite,          

278
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,527
   which they cut to a point.   

279
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,633
       these blades carve       
     grooves down the sides.    

280
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,836
         when you write,        
  these grooves fill with ink,  

281
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,772
       regulating the rate      
        of the ink flow.        

282
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,182
      one end of the feeder     
       goes into a holder.      

283
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,052
       the other end slips      
         behind the nib.        

284
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:44,789
   this machine pushes the nib  
    into its final position,    

285
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,827
    which technicians verify    
       under a magnifier.       

286
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,598
    elsewhere in the factory,   

287
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,534
     they produce the pen's     
         external parts.        

288
00:18:56,536 --> 00:19:00,204
          here, presses         
   and metal drawing machinery  

289
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,308
   shape sterling-silver disks  
         into pen caps.         

290
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,614
    the cap protects the nib,   
           of course,           

291
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,417
      but it also provides      
        decorative flair,       

292
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,285
     often having guilloche,    

293
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,955
          an intricate,         
     diamond-cut engraving.     

294
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,691
  the factory's computer-guided 
       engraving equipment      

295
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:23,328
      decorates this model      
      with subtle stripes.      

296
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,768
       a rolling engraver       
then applies the company's name.

297
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,174
      every cap has a clip      
    made of beryllium copper,   

298
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,411
   a strong yet flexible metal  
    which they plate in gold.   

299
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,451
   the barrel and other parts   
         for many models        

300
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,853
  are made from plastic resin.  

301
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,389
  an injection-molding machine  
 melts resin pellets into liquid

302
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,325
   then shoots it into molds.   

303
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,060
   when the resin solidifies,   

304
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:59,264
  the machine ejects the molded 
   parts ready for polishing.   

305
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,939
  the pieces join to each other 
  with metal connecting rings.  

306
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,278
       the pen assembler        
       carefully measures       

307
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,214
   the placement of the resin   
   piston within the barrel.    

308
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,955
   once the piston's inserted,  

309
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,525
     the edge of the barrel     
   gets a thin coat of sealant  

310
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,427
      to prevent ink leaks.     

311
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,831
       then the assembler       
     screws on the endpiece,    

312
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,265
    the same one you unscrew    

313
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,568
      to draw up the piston     
        and fill the pen.       

314
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,439
      the finishing touch       
      is to mount the nib.      

315
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,376
 finally, every pen goes through
 a specific set of writing tests

316
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,178
    to ensure its performance   

317
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,215
           measures up          
   to its stylish good looks.   

318
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,395
