narrator: today on "how it's made"...       

5
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,054
the invention of polyurethane 

6
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,789
skateboard wheels in the early 1970s       

7
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,893
suddenly made jumps and tight cornering possible  

8
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,363
because these wheels had    
a better grip on riding surfaces

9
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,066
than the old metal or ceramic wheels.       

10
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,200
they were more durable,    

11
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,136
and the shock absorption was greatly improved.     

12
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,875
skateboard wheels come in different sizes,      

13
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,578
hardness, colors and graphic designs.      

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,647
for the rider, there are may practical    

15
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,850
and aesthetic considerations. 

16
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:29,154
making skateboard wheels starts
with a computer design.    

17
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,858
a designer uses the software to guide cutting tools.    

18
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,462
the tools carve into a solid aluminum puck   

19
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:39,665
and transform it into one half of a wheel mold. 

20
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,205
next, the other half of the mold takes shape    

21
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,173
as the computerized tooling sculpts        

22
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,109
another puck to a profile   

23
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,511
that fits to the first one perfectly.         

24
00:01:56,117 --> 00:02:00,285
not all of the skateboard wheel
molds are two-part versions.  

25
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,654
others are one-piece structures,

26
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:07,192
each with a pin in the center to form a bearing cavity.   

27
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,462
a nozzle dispenses freshly mixed polyurethane liquid   

28
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,931
into the wheel molds.     

29
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,834
the liquid starts to solidify immediately.    

30
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,738
to complete the process,    

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,407
a worker loads the polyurethane-filled molds 

32
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,109
into an oven and bakes them         

33
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:28,113
at almost 240 degrees fahrenheit
for 40 minutes.        

34
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,719
during baking, any bubbles in the polyurethane rise    

35
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,754
to the top and are diffused,       

36
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:40,258
leaving solid forms with no weak spots.      

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,395
workers remove the pins from the molds.        

38
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,497
then it's on to the next station.      

39
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,770
here, a worker blasts compressed air     

40
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,206
between the wheels and the molds to pry      

41
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,609
the wheels free and pop them out.       

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,281
another worker probes the wheel
using a durometer gauge    

43
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,382
to ensure the urethane has cured

44
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,119
to the right degree of hardness.

45
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,621
if the sample wheel is sufficiently hard,     

46
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,557
the batch is ready for the next step.       

47
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,794
the worker clamps       
the skateboard wheel in a lathe.

48
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,329
the lathe spins the wheel   

49
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,130
while an automatic cutter contours        

50
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,334
the edges to a softer, more rounded profile.     

51
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,373
to give the skateboard wheels some visual impact,   

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,375
an artists selects and arranges graphic      

53
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,144
designs on a computer.     

54
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,316
he prints a film negative of the images he's chosen.   

55
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,520
a worker will use this negative
to produce a printing plate  

56
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,590
from a piece of metal that's been coated       

57
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:48,193
with a light-sensitive substance known as emulsion.  

58
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,195
he places the film negative on the plate          

59
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,631
inside a uv light chamber.   

60
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,468
he closes the lid and activates the uv light.  

61
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,636
this triggers a photochemical reaction    

62
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,707
that transfers the image from the negative to the plate.

63
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,278
the worker then applies a solution that removes    

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,848
unexposed emulsion and, in the process,        

65
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,453
etches the image into the printing plate.    

66
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,588
he rinses off the chemicals.  

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,228
next, he dries the plate to reveal the etched artwork. 

68
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,899
another worker positions a magnetized          

69
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,434
ink cup overview the image   

70
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,004
and installs it in a pad printing machine.   

71
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,810
an operator loads skateboard wheels onto posts       

72
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:40,345
that index them forward for printing.         

73
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,453
the ink cup deposits ink on the printing plate.   

74
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,590
a silicone pad picks up the inked image and stamps   

75
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,192
it onto the skateboard wheel. 

76
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,062
the operator removes the printed wheel       

77
00:04:57,064 --> 00:05:00,498
and sets it on a tray.     

78
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,800
a technician now clamps    

79
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,801
one of the wheels in a testing device,      

80
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,238
which will gauge the rebound. 

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,274
he drops a metal ball onto the wheel and measures  

82
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:13,011
how high it bounces or rebounds.          

83
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,815
a high rebound is desirable.  

84
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,486
these skateboard wheels are now cleared for shipping. 

85
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,157
a worker wraps the wheels in plastic and heat shrinks it.

86
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:31,630
it takes about 3 days     
to make these skateboard wheels.

87
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:35,133
but how long they'll last depends a lot on the rider

88
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,536

although several european and middle eastern countries

have versions of baklava,   

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,731
most consist of filo pastry

00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,934
filled with nuts drenched in honey or syrup.       

96
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,703
galaktoboureko is filo filled with custard          

97
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,306
and coated with sweet syrup.  

98

this variety of baklava called burma          

99
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,346
is made not with filo dough, like classic baklava,     

100
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,649
but with kataifi, shredded wheat dough.     

101
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,952
burma, like classic filo baklava,         

102
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:31,089
contains whole pistachios, never pistachio powder.    

103
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,824
this burma chef pours     

104
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,994
granulated sugar over the pistachio kernels.     

105
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,564
next, he sprinkles rose water, 

106
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,933
although this ingredient is optional,

water, cinnamon and nutmeg   

109
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,572
as well as lemon to prevent the sugar      

110
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,175
from later crystallizing.   

111
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,045
he mixes by hand to thoroughly coat the kernels.  

112
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:57,983
the kataifi is made of all-purpose flour,     

113
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,053
milk and water.        

114
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,489
the chef lays out a section of dough,      

115
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,458
then takes a handful of pistachio          

116
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,626
filling and places it on the dough,        

117
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,630
forming a line running down the middle.    

118
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,365
for a burma loaf this size,  

119
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,134
the filling is about an inch wide and high.     

120
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,741
he folds the end closed and rolls the dough at an angle

121
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,309
down the length of the burma, 

122
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,346
tightly encasing the filling as he goes.    

123
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:33,352
at the end, he folds the opposite end closed.    

124
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:38,056
it takes a burma chef months to perfect this technique.   

125
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:41,859
he places it on a tray to air-dry for 24 hours    

126
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:46,030
to ensure the dough maintains its rolled shape.  

127
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:50,135
unlike classic baklava, which is baked, burma is fried.

128
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,237
and the risk of burning the pistachios     

129
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,106
makes this the most technically

130
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,708
challenging type of baklava to make.      

131
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,643
the chef fries the loaves   

132
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,278
for 3 minutes in oil heated  

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,780
to around 350 degrees fahrenheit,    

134
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,250
turning them once per minute.        

135
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:09,120
he lets the oil drain off for half an hour.     

136
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,390
then, he pours warm caramelized        

137
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,924
sugar over the loaves     

138
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,260
and lets them soak for 20 minutes.        

139
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,328
the sugar-to-water ratio    

140
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,197
and the boiling time of the caramelized       

141
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,899
sugar have to be just right.  

142
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,269
otherwise, it will become either too hard        

143
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:28,206
or to gooey when it cools.   

144
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,108
after letting the excess drain off,     

145
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,012
the loaves rest for about 3 hours.       

146
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,349
then the chef rolls the loaf to flatten      

147
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,883
out the bumps         

148
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,520
and slices it into equal pieces.     

149
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,025
but if there's a protracted battle      

150
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,296
waging between your sweet tooth and your willpower,   

151
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,663
you've got plenty of time   

152
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,932
to work your way through a box of burma     

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,803

154
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,775
to make galaktoboureko,    

155
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,677
the chef begins with two ingredients,     

156
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,182
milk and semolina.       

157
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,150
after bringing the milk to a boil,           

158
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,219
he gradually adds the semolina 

159
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,155
while whisking and lowering the temperature.        

160
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:21,159
once the mix thickens, he sets it aside to cool.   

161
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:25,330
in a separate bowl, the chef whisks eggs,     

162
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,332
adds vanilla,         

163
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,634
then lemon or orange rind.   

164
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:34,138
other options are orange blossom or rose water extract. 

165
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,442
he transfers the ingredients to an electric mixer,     

166
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,144
adds butter and sugar.     

167
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:42,247
then he adds the semolina and milk mixture.       

168
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,516
this mixture must be cool   

169
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:48,319
so that the eggs don't cook.  

170
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,355
once everything is thoroughly blended,     

171
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,325
the galaktoboureko custard is ready.       

172
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,630
the chef now turns his attention
to the filo dough.       

173
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,133
he stacks 24 parchment-thin sheets     

174
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,670
of filo and slices them into squares.       

175
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,539
he places one scoopful of custard           

176
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,140
in the center of each square. 

177
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:13,111
the traditional greek way is to roll the squares     

178
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,081
or bake a large galaktoboureko in a pan            

179
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,316
and then cut it into squares.         

180
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,719
however, this chef folds over each square        

181
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:24,222
to make lebanese-style triangles.           

182
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,225
he douses the top with clarified butter,     

183
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,295
butter that's been boiled to separate out the solids   

184
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,297
and leave just the oil.    

185
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,765
then he bakes the pastries   

186
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:38,370
for 45 minutes at 325 degrees fahrenheit.   

187
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,105
the golden-baked top shines  

188
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,607
thanks to the clarified butter.

189
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,044
the chef cooks the same syrup he made for the baklava,    

190
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,912
sugar, water, cinnamon,    

191
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,347
nutmeg and lemon        

192

194
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,754
he sprinkles on cinnamon for traditional flavor     

195
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,791

narrator: the annual apple harvest is just 2 months long. 

198
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,077
to keep apples fresh in storage for several months, 

199
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,546
growers lower the storeroom oxygen level          

200
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,814
to put the apples into hibernation.       

201
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,819
then they use machines called co2 scrubbers to absorb 

202
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,556
and remove the carbon dioxide gas the apples give off.    

203
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,360
this co2 scrubber pulls air  

204
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,396
from the airtight apple storage
room through carbon pellets,  

205
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,533
which absorb the co2 gas molecules.         

206
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,369
the machine then blows the co2-free air        

207
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,771
back into the room.      

208
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,708
workers build the machine's frame out of tubular steel.  

209
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,911
the frame supports all the components,      

210
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,480
including two sealed vessels filled with carbon pellets.  

211
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,817
the first vessel starts absorbing co2,     

212
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,552
a process called scrubbing,  

213
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,821
until its pellets are saturated.         

214
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,858
then the second vessel takes over the scrubbing.   

215
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,060
the first vessel automatically kicks      

216
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,929
into a regeneration cycle,   

217
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,532
which blows fresh air through the pellets      

218
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,767
to remove the co2 molecules  

219
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,868
and exhaust them out the building.       

220

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,440
vessel one resumes scrubbing  

222
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,309
while vessel two regenerates. 

223
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,212
to construct each vessel,   

224
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,582
workers weld a steel sheet into a circular shape,     

225
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,685
then weld on a base and a top ring.        

226
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,920
the ring has holes along its perimeter      

227
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,622
for bolting on a lid.     

228
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,090
they use a ring template    

229
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,860
to make corresponding holes in the lid,       

230
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:46,497
making the exact center of each hole with a punch tool.

231
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,667
then a worker mounts the lid on a fixture      

232
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,402
and following those marks,   

233
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,839
uses an automated steel punch to perforate the steel. 

234
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,847
the vessels go to the paint booth        

235
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,816
for a coat of powder paint,  

236
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,952
then into an oven to bake the paint.       

237
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,954
when they come out, the vessels are ready     

238
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,958
to be filled with carbon pellets and sealed.      

239
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:19,631
once filled to the top, workers lay in a steel baffle. 

240
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,537
its holes evenly distribute air passing through the vessel.

241
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,374
a worker then places a foam rubber gasket      

242
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,344
around the perimeter      

243
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,547
and bolts on the lid tightly. 

244
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,617
this seals the vessel and prevents the air      

245
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,252
being blown through it from leaking out.       

246
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,654
the sealed lid also prevents oxygen      

247
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,323
from getting into the machine 

248
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,460
and from there into the apple storage room.    

249
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,762
next, workers install the pvc 

250
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:51,996
piping that feeds air     

251
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,400
through the vessels along with two blowers.    

252
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,136
one blower pulls air from the apple storage room  

253
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,105
into the machine for scrubbing.

254
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:03,141
the other sends it back to the room after scrubbing.  

255
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,080
the air flow through the pipes is controlled by valves,    

256
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:13,017
which are wired to the machine's
electrical panel.       

257
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,821
that electrical panel, consisting of relays, pumps,  

258
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,057
gas analyzers and a touch screen,      

259
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,627
is built in-house in accordance         

260
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,362
with the required electrical standards      

261
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,398
of the customer's country.   

262
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,467
the panel is wired to a computer         

263
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,137
which controls the entire operation.     

264
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,643
then a worker installs an electrical box       

265
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,445
into the machine's frame.   

266
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,985
and he installs the electrical panel      

267
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,488
inside the box.        

268
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,396
next, the worker connects the wires to the valves,    

269
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,499
installs the touch screen   
and hooks it up to the computer.

270
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,302
the touch screen lets the machine's operator  

271
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,305
program oxygen and co2 target levels     

272
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,376
specific to the type of apple stored in the room.      

273
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,844
this is critical,       

274
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:16,748
as different varieties of apples
give off more co2 than others. 

275
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,652
how does it all work?     

276
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,653
the grower stacks bins of apples         

277
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,223
in an airtight storeroom.   

278
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,925
a nitrogen generator feeds in nitrogen       

279
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,230
to reduce the room's oxygen level to 1.8%.         

280
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,464
when that happens,       

281
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,300
the nitrogen feed automatically stops,      

282
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:41,038
and the continuous co2 scrubbing
automatically begins.     

283
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,341
many growers have in-house labs

284
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,143
which conduct quality control tests on samples

by about 8 months,

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,408
that's borrowed from the bees adds visual interest.     

306
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,710
the candle makers start with beeswax       

307
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,012
that has had the impurities filtered out  

308
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,815
and has been bleached.     

309
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,116
a worker first pours the beeswax

310
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:03,555
into a big gas-heated kettle until it melts.        

311
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:04,956
it only takes around 1/10   

312
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,423
of an ounce of powdered dye  

313
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,760
to tint the big vat of wax.  

314
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,930
he measures the amount carefully.     

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
the worker adds the dye and,  

316
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,836
as it dissolves in the liquid beeswax,     

317
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,306
he stirs it to distribute it evenly.           

318
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,243
he then opens a valve,     

319
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,580
and the wax flows into a trough beneath a large drum. 

320
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:35,186
this drum is cooled by a system of chillers.    

321
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,022
as it rotates, it picks up the wax.      

322
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,358
and the wax solidifies on contact           

323
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,793
with the drum's cool surface. 

324
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,862
the system then pulls the wax sheets         

325
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,200
through a narrow aperture to squeeze it thinner.     

326
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,734
at this point, the consistency        

327
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,138
of the wax is similar to that of taffy.       

328
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,608
but unlike taffy, it's not very sticky,     

329
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,945
so the layers don't adhere when rolled onto a shaft.   

330
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,583
the next member of the team  

331
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,386
now prepares a bath of warm water and soap.    

332
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,726
he then loosens up the coil of beeswax by hand.  

333
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,461
the roll slackens.       

334
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,997
the wax layers separate,    

335
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,266
leaving spaces between them.  

336
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,003
he immerses the wax in warm water.         

337
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,539
and it flows between the layers.      

338
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,841
the warm water softens the edges       

339
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,944
as a thinning machine reduces the thickness     

340
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,447
of the wax by half.      

341
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,782
using blocks of ice,      

342
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,551
the operator then cools the softened wax        

343
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,788
to firm it up again.      

344
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,592
he constantly adds liquid soap for lubrication.     

345
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,628
this keeps the beeswax moving through the thinning machine  

346
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,430
and prevents snags.      

347
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,034
using a measuring instrument called a caliper,       

348
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,604
he gauges the thickness of the wax to confirm     

349
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:02,006
that it's 0.16 of a centimeter.        

350
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,779
next, the operator removes the roll of beeswax      

351
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,548
from the thinning machine spindle and transfers it    

352
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,584
to the spindle for the next machine.     

353
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,622
this machine pulls the wax through a bath of icy water  

354
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,058
to firm it up even more.    

355
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,458
this will top the wax     

356
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,761
from sticking to embossing rollers      

357
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,699
that now impress the hexagonal pattern onto it. 

358
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,233
each of the embossing rollers 

359
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:33,538
is studded with 3,500 hexagonal-shaped rivets.    

360
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,008
they stamp the pattern onto both sides of the wax.  

361
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,244
a blade slices the embossed beeswax into sheets      

362
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:44,615
that are 16 inches in length. 

363
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,151
the sheets pass under another roller.     

364
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,188
and this one propels them off the track.         

365
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,156
the sheets are briefly airborne

366
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,459
and then, they land in a neat stack.   

367
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,260
♪♪         

368
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,135
to make them into candles,   

369
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,337
another member of the team cuts the sheets        

370
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,774
to the desired length and width.

371
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,409
the dimensions will vary depending on     

372
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,645
the size of the candles to be made.    

373
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,816
leftover remnants will be melted down      

374
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,585
to make new candles.      

375
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,990
these beeswax sheets are now ready to be rolled by hand.  

376
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,460
the candle maker places    

377
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:33,331
a cotton wick on one edge of the sheet.   

378
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,200
she then wraps the wax around the wick,        

379
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,903
applying gentle pressure as she works.         

380
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,174
she presses the layers firmly together        

381
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,042
because the tighter the roll, 

382
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,744
the longer the candle will burn.

383
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,815
at room temperature, the wax is warm,        

384
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,384
so the layers of the candle adhere.     

385
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:59,257
finally, she packages them in plastic cellophane     

386
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,694
and applies all the necessary labels.   

387
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,695
these honeycomb beeswax candles

388
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,731
are now ready to light up a space      

389
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,966
and help set the mood.     

390
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,636
they should burn for 8 or 9 hours        

391
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,072
or until it's time to call it a night.
