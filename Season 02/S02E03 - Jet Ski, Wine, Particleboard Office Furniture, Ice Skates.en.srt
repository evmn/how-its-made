00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,090
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,627
     personal watercraft...     

3
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,828
             wine...            

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,964
          particleboard         
       office furniture...      

5
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,133
         and ice skates.        

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,172
        they're to water        
  what snowmobiles are to snow, 

7
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,774
  what motorcycles are to road. 

8
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,177
         the proper term        
  for these adrenaline-pumping, 

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,446
   wind-in-your-face vehicles   
     is personal watercraft,    

10
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,849
         but most people        
       call them sea-doos.      

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,657
      the fiberglass shell      
  that's the body of the craft  

12
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,859
  is molded at another factory. 

13
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,328
   it arrives here ready-made.  

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,263
     workers use a template     

15
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,133
  to position decorative decals 
       on the upper shell,      

16
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,134
        called the deck.        

17
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,683
       next, they install       
  rubber footpads on the steps. 

18
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,759
      a robot drills holes      
      in the lower shell,       

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,027
        called the hull,        

20
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,063
first for the drainage system...

21
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,502
 ...then for the exhaust system.

22
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,990
next, workers install the straps

23
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:08,393
   that will hold the internal  
      components in place.      

24
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,464
then they install the rubber pad
   that goes under the motor.   

25
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:22,241
   next comes the motor mount   
   to hold the motor in place.  

26
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,079
   finally, the motor itself.   

27
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,681
   this 130-horsepower engine   

28
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,016
     arrives at the factory     
        fully assembled.        

29
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,153
          it's a matter         
     of putting it in place.    

30
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,761
       next, they install       
         the jet pump --        

31
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,496
that's what gives the watercraft
        its jet power --        

32
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,766
        then the battery,       

33
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,367
      then the driveline --     

34
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,838
   that's what links the motor  
        and the jet pump.       

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,542
     the 14-gallon gas tank     
          goes in next.         

36
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,949
  they connect the driveline... 

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,420
...then install the jet housing.

38
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,990
  that's the protective casing  
      around the jet pump.      

39
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,868
           meanwhile,           
   a robot works on the deck.   

40
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,973
    it applies globs of glue    
        in key locations.       

41
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,757
 workers stick on various straps

42
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,027
         that will hold         
  internal components in place. 

43
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,900
      then the robot glues      
        the circumference       

44
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,537
   of both the hull and deck.   

45
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:06,111
       they heat the hull       
     to activate the glue...    

46
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,391
     ...then clamp the deck     
          to the hull.          

47
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,897
         the glue takes         
    about 15 minutes to dry.    

48
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,368
  using an ultrasound machine,  

49
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,172
      they inspect the seal     
  to make sure it's watertight. 

50
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,147
   next, they install the hood  
    and the steering column.    

51
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,921
      now it's time to run      
         an engine test.        

52
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,170
   the last step is to install  
        a plastic bumper.       

53
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,974
      a roller presses it       
      securely into place.      

54
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:30,528
            narrator:           
   researchers invented a way   
  to identify faraway objects,  

55
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,531
        even in thick fog       
      or complete darkness.     

56
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,068
 they use a laser combined with 
military night vision technology

57
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,538
   to locate objects or people  
        up to miles away.       

58
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,674
    the system is so precise,   

59
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,644
 it can read the name of a boat 
      in the dead of night.     

60
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,618
     the next time you enjoy    
        a glass of wine,        

61
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,487
     think about your place     
           in history.          

62
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,623
 wine may date back to 6000 b.c.

63
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,758
nowadays, wine comes in bottles,

64
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,093
        not animal skins,       

65
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,964
    but the basic principles    
 of winemaking remain the same. 

66
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,637
     wine grapes grow best      
     in temperate climates.     

67
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,578
      the riper the grapes,     
      the sweeter the wine,     

68
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,047
         so growers wait        
       as long as possible      

69
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,715
  before harvesting their crop. 

70
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,051
 pickers gather grapes by hand, 

71
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,987
     cutting off the bunches    
           with shears          

72
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,989
   to avoid tearing the plant.  

73
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,692
    for red wine, winemakers    
   use the entire red grape --  

74
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,662
       juice, skin, pulp,       
         and even seeds.        

75
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:42,934
    for white wine, they use    
 just the juice of white grapes.

76
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:46,471
  while the winemaking process  
  itself is certainly a factor, 

77
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,806
    the quality of the grapes   

78
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,742
  is what ultimately determines 
    the quality of the wine.    

79
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:55,413
 grapes are affected by weather,
       by soil conditions,      

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,251
 and by how the vines are pruned
   during and between seasons.  

81
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,021
 the grapes go into the crusher,

82
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,659
     then into the presser,     
  which squeezes out the juice. 

83
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,847
       inside the winery,       

84
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,383
 the result of all that crushing
          and pressing          

85
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,519
        ends up in large        
     stainless steel tanks.     

86
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,188
    the winemaker adds yeast    

87
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,390
      to convert the sugar      
 in the grape juice to alcohol. 

88
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,059
   that's called fermentation.  

89
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,796
winemakers constantly experiment
        with fermentation       

90
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,867
  to try to improve the quality 
         of their wine.         

91
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,802
they take samples of grape juice

92
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,004
          and mix them          
 with different types of yeast. 

93
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,273
    yeast is found throughout   
        the environment,        

94
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,342
 in wild berries, for instance. 

95
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,145
     they hydrate the yeast     
   with a bit of grape juice,   

96
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,814
        then pour the mix       
  into the grape juice sample,  

97
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,751
         let it ferment,        
 and then see how it turns out. 

98
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,758
   the big fermentation tanks   
        are refrigerated,       

99
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,495
and monitoring their temperature
          is critical.          

100
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,499
  white wine must be fermented  
      at around 63 degrees,     

101
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,101
  red wine at 86 to 95 degrees. 

102
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,505
     the fermentation period    
  depends on the type of wine.  

103
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,175
    white wine has to ferment   
        for three weeks,        

104
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,444
   red wine for just 10 days.   

105
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:36,314
      rosé wine is somewhat     
       of a half-breed...       

106
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,515
      made with red grapes,     

107
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,051
      but fermented slowly,     
        like white wine.        

108
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,321
       it comes out pink.       

109
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,257
      there's an extra step     
       in making red wine.      

110
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,992
      during fermentation,      

111
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,595
       they drain the tank      
       to aerate the wine.      

112
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,264
        the oxygen helps        
      the yeast work faster     

113
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,768
      over the short 10-day     
      fermentation period.      

114
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,075
 then they pump the wine back in
   through the top of the tank  

115
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,344
  to mix everything thoroughly. 

116
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,612
      during fermentation,      

117
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,748
          they not only         
      monitor temperature,      

118
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
    but also the sugar level.   

119
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,753
   as the juice becomes wine,   
     the sugar level drops,     

120
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,288
and the alcohol level increases.

121
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,490
  except for very sweet wines,  

122
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,494
    fermentation is finished    
      when the sugar's gone     

123
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:26,564
     and the alcohol content    
   is 11% to 13% for red wine,  

124
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:31,469
        or 11% to 11 1/2%       
       for white and rosé.      

125
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,707
       the wine is stored       
       for a few months,        

126
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,210
      then it's run through     
    several pressure filters    

127
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,514
    to remove any particles.    

128
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,786
         then it's time         
       to bottle the wine.      

129
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,189
       large wineries have      
fully automated bottling plants.

130
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,924
       smaller operations       

131
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,794
   have semi-automated systems  
         like this one.         

132
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,864
    the key in bottling wine    
 is to avoid getting air inside 

133
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,401
 because oxygen turns wine sour.

134
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,271
    the colored wine bottles    
  protect the wine from light,  

135
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,275
which can also affect the taste.

136
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,078
  people have used cork to plug 
wine bottles since ancient times

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,282
 because it creates a tight seal
     that keeps the air out.    

138
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,620
       cork, incidentally,      
     is a type of tree bark.    

139
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,893
       inside the bottle,       

140
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:32,296
  the wine continues to undergo 
     subtle organic changes     

141
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,165
           as it ages.          

142
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:45,176
            narrator:           
    nowadays, you have to be    
   pretty high up in a company  

143
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,111
   to have a solid wood desk.   

144
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,914
    your desk is more likely    
    made of pressed wood --     

145
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,585
   an inexpensive alternative   
  made from lumber by-products. 

146
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:57,155
 particleboard is a common type 
        of pressed wood.        

147
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,793
      lumber mill leftovers     

148
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,528
    provide the raw materials   
       for particleboard.       

149
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,433
       the process starts       
   with truckloads of sawdust.  

150
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,939
      the next ingredients      
are wood shavings and wood chips

151
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,208
    from all types of lumber.   

152
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,812
      they feed those chips     
 and shavings into a large mill 

153
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,481
         that works like        
     a giant food processor,    

154
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,451
        chopping them up        
        into little bits.       

155
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,688
    when the milling's done,    

156
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,359
   the particles are between    
   .008 and .5 inches in size   

157
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,463
 and less than .03 inches thick.

158
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,168
   to make the humidity level   
            uniform,            

159
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,971
     they put the particles     
        into giant dryers       

160
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,774
    whose combustion chambers   
   are fueled by leftover dust  

161
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,309
     from the chopping mill.    

162
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,778
     after 15 to 25 minutes,    

163
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,248
    the humidity level drops    
            to 1.5%.            

164
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,118
     from here, they'll send    
     the dried-out particles    

165
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,519
     to a screening machine,    

166
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,188
    which will separate them    
            by size.            

167
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,859
pieces too big for particleboard
are fed through the mill again. 

168
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,528
    sawdust will become fuel    
         for the dryers.        

169
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,664
        larger particles        
 go into the rougher core layer 

170
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,866
      of the particleboard,     

171
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,736
       smaller pieces into      
   the smoother surface layer.  

172
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,273
    meanwhile, the factory's    
  glue department gets to work  

173
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:26,211
    mixing resin, water, wax,   
     and chemical hardeners.    

174
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,946
      machines mix the glue     
       and the particles,       

175
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,717
          then push out         
     a long, continuous mat.    

176
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,288
        a cold compressor       
 forces the air out of the mat. 

177
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,757
        then a hot press        
       activates the glue       

178
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,160
   and forces it all together.  

179
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:45,029
        next, a saw cuts        
       the continuous mat       

180
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,166
        into large sheets       
      called master boards.     

181
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,968
        they're still hot       
       from the hot press,      

182
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,373
  so they're put aside to cool  
     for about a half-hour.     

183
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,576
once the master boards are cool,
         they're sanded.        

184
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,847
     then a stacking machine    
piles them about 80 sheets high.

185
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,186
 a saw cuts them into a smaller,
      more manageable size      

186
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:11,322
         to be sent off         
     to a furniture factory.    

187
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,991
    at the furniture factory,   

188
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,461
  the first step is to laminate 
    the particleboard panels    

189
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,396
   with a decorative covering.  

190
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:22,534
 first, the glue spreader covers
 the board's surface with glue. 

191
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,735
 then another machine sticks on 

192
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,872
      a 4- to 5-foot strip      
      of decorative paper       

193
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,409
 fortified with resin, varnish, 
      and other chemicals.      

194
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,012
   this covering comes in many  
  different colors and designs, 

195
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,616
           from solids          
  to imitation granite or wood. 

196
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:43,354
     a blade cuts the paper     
       between each board.      

197
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:48,693
then a machine stacks the boards
  to prepare them for cutting.  

198
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,629
    the saw cuts through six    
   to eight boards at a time,   

199
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,731
  depending on their thickness. 

200
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,837
    the next step is to cover   
 the edges of the particleboard.

201
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
        they take a strip       
       made of pvc plastic      

202
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,509
   that matches the laminate.   

203
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,947
  they glue it over the edges,  
 then trim it for a neat finish.

204
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,995
       next, they prepare       
    the pieces for assembly.    

205
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,967
      a multiple-head drill     
makes screw holes in the panels.

206
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,473
     meanwhile, they prepare    
      the bag of hardware.      

207
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,476
     there's a separate bin     

208
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,813
   for each screw, nut, bolt,   
         and connector.         

209
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,083
     the machines count out     
  the exact number of hardware  

210
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,419
           each piece           
     of furniture requires.     

211
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,624
        then the hardware       
     is automatically bagged    

212
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,926
           and weighed          
 to make sure nothing's missing.

213
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,296
         every so often,        
   a worker assembles a sample  

214
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,700
     to make sure everything    
     fits together properly.    

215
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,836
           if it does,          
      production continues,     

216
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,472
      and they can proceed      
          to packaging.         

217
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,243
       they put together        
       the particleboards       

218
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,445
  for each piece of furniture,  

219
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,115
      add the hardware bag      
    and instruction booklet,    

220
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,919
      then seal everything      
        in plastic film.        

221
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,024
  from here, it goes into a box 
   to be shipped to the store.  

222
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
     narrator: getting your     
    first pair of ice skates    

223
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,735
         is like getting        
       your first bicycle.      

224
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,004
      it's a childhood rite     
           of passage,          

225
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,074
  and one that leads to another 
      well-known ritual --      

226
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,745
    landing on your backside    
the first time you try them out.

227
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,955
      how long have we been     
          ice-skating?          

228
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,427
     an iron skate found in     
 scandinavia dates to 200 a.d., 

229
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:06,431
  but people likely put blades  
 made of bone under their shoes 

230
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,100
     even earlier than that.    

231
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,836
         skaters tied on        
    their blades with straps    

232
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:17,208
     until the advent of the    
 skate boot in the early 1900s. 

233
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,577
          today, skates         
  are lightweight and high-tech 

234
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,181
        and are designed        
     for specific sports --     

235
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,851
         figure skating,        
   speed skating, and hockey.   

236
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:39,663
   it takes 145 steps to make   
   this high-end hockey skate.  

237
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,332
     the skate boot is made     
     of a synthetic material    

238
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,868
           that looks           
     and feels like leather.    

239
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,139
   once they've cut the pieces  
   that will make up the boot,  

240
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,673
      they shave the edges,     

241
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,076
        thinning them out       
   so the boot won't be bulky,  

242
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,679
       particularly where       
  there's overlap at the seams. 

243
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,149
          they position         
      a reinforcement piece     

244
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,084
       onto what's called       
         the quarter --         

245
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,552
    the main structural piece   

246
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,488
    that will form the sides    
   and back of the skate boot.  

247
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,625
         they glue it on        
        with a hot press.       

248
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:11,428
     the boot pieces now go     
    to the sewing department.   

249
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,964
      they stitch together      
        the tongue piece,       

250
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,767
      then, using a sturdy      
         zigzag stitch,         

251
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,971
     they attach the quarter    
       and the heel piece.      

252
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,753
         they spray glue        
        on the quarter...       

253
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,291
 ...and on the ankle support... 

254
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,595
          ...then stick         
       on a foam ankle pad      

255
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:49,867
designed to mold to the contours
     of the skater's ankles.    

256
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,435
     next comes the lining.     

257
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,337
  they must center it perfectly 

258
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,807
       for the skate to be      
 properly aligned and balanced. 

259
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,344
       the eyelet machine       
    works like a hole punch,    

260
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:04,882
      punching out eyelets      
         in the quarter.        

261
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,686
   they reinforce each eyelet   
    with an aluminum washer.    

262
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,223
          the last step         
    in the sewing department    

263
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,958
       is called forming.       

264
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,693
       they place the boot      
     over a metal foot form.    

265
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,030
 a hot press laminates the boot 
        to give the back        

266
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,600
    and sides of the quarter    
          their shape.          

267
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,103
   in the assembly department,  

268
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,039
   they put the parts together  
       using a foot form.       

269
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,576
          they tack on          
     a white plastic insole     

270
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,045
  and a black plastic toe cap.  

271
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,814
they brush on a layer of glue...

272
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,923
     ...and attach the boot.    

273
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,608
they sand the bottom of the boot

274
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,878
    to roughen up the surface   
      for better adhesion.      

275
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,750
      an automated machine      
     applies a layer of glue    

276
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,487
       along the contours       
    of the boot's underside.    

277
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,158
   the boot then goes through   
         a heat machine         

278
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,560
     for a couple of seconds    

279
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,761
    to evaporate the solvent    
          in the glue,          

280
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,697
       making it tackier.       

281
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,172
       as with the lining,      

282
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,575
       they must position       
       the sole perfectly,      

283
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:41,979
        or they'll throw        
     the skate off-balance.     

284
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,249
         an 8-ton press         
    presses it onto the boot.   

285
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,251
        the sole is made        
        of strong carbon        

286
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:51,088
       or carbon composite      
  depending on the skate model. 

287
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,195
      once the glue is dry,     

288
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,330
      they drill two holes      
        through the sole        

289
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,999
 for attaching the skate blade. 

290
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,872
         the blade sits         
      in a plastic holder.      

291
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,275
     they screw it in place     
       through the holes,       

292
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,277
         then secure it         
     with five steel rivets     

293
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,614
     and four more resistant    
         copper rivets.         

294
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,149
  like the lining in the sole,  

295
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,219
      the blade's alignment     
           is crucial.          

296
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:26,357
  roller hockey skates are made 
       almost the same way      

297
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,093
      as ice hockey skates,     
    just instead of a blade,    

298
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:33,231
 they attach an aluminum chassis
          with rollers.         

299
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,831
  in the finishing department,  

300
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,968
     they inspect the inside    
          of the skate,         

301
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,237
    checking the blade holes    
    and rivets in particular.   

302
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,740
   they plug the blade holes.   

303
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,445
        then they lace up       
the first three sets of eyelets.

304
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,115
      finally, they install     
  what's called the footbed --  

305
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:54,652
  the high-density foam padding 
    that lies under the foot.   

306
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,120
      last, but not least,      
      they clean the skate,     

307
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,391
     trimming excess threads    
 and removing any glue residue.
