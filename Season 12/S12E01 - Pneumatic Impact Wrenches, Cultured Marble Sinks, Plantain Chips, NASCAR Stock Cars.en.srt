00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,392
tightens and untightens nuts,   
bolts, and other fasteners.     
you hook it up to the air hose  

6
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:00,892
bolts, and other fasteners.     
you hook it up to the air hose  
coming off a compressor.        

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,528
you hook it up to the air hose  
coming off a compressor.        
the anvil at the tip turns at

the anvil at the tip turns at   
high speed to tighten until     

9
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,098
the anvil at the tip turns at   
high speed to tighten until     
snug, then switches to a

hammering action, called        
impacting, to tighten even more.

12
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,611
you've probably seen a pneumatic
impact wrench in action at your 
local garage.                   

13
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:19,878
impact wrench in action at your 
local garage.

at the manufacturing plant, they
machine the rotor from a bar of 
steel mounted on a lathe.       

23
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,863
machine the rotor from a bar of 
steel mounted on a lathe.       
it takes about a minute and a   

24
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,031
steel mounted on a lathe.       
it takes about a minute and a   
half for the computer-guided    

25
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,833
it takes about a minute and a   
half for the computer-guided    
precision tools to carve out the

26
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:43,102

the next machine carves teeth on
one end of the rotor, creating  
what's called a hobbed edge.    

30
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:01,086
now a computer-guided mill cuts 
eight slots.                    
this shaping of the steel       

31
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,788
eight slots.                    
this shaping of the steel       
generates a lot of heat, so     

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,323
this shaping of the steel       
generates a lot of heat, so

00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:27,079
next, they temper the rotors for
10 hours in a                   
1,700-degree-fahrenheit furnace.

37
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:29,114
10 hours in a

this hardens and strengthens the
steel, but to fortify it        

39
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,018
this hardens and strengthens the
steel, but to fortify it        
further, they pump in carbon    

40
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,953
steel, but to fortify it        
further, they pump in carbon    
from a propane burner.          

41
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,755
further, they pump in carbon    
from a propane burner.          
the carbon impregnates each     

42
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,056

the carbon impregnates each     
rotor to a depth of             

43
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,826
the carbon impregnates each     
rotor to a depth of             
.7 millimeters.

00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,564
once the rotor cools, a         
computer-controlled grinder     
shapes it to the final          

47
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,900
computer-controlled grinder     
shapes it to the final          
specifications.                 

48
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,801
shapes it to the final          
specifications.                 
then a machine with nylon

00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:54,339
specifications.                 
then a machine with nylon       
bristles smoothes the surface.  

50
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,674
then a machine with nylon       
bristles smoothes the surface.  
this completes the              

51
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,777
bristles smoothes the surface.  
this completes the              
transformation from steel bar to

52
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,380
this completes the              
transformation from steel bar to
rotor.

housing has been getting a      
bright coat of paint.           
the housing has two parts -- the

57
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,323
bright coat of paint.           
the housing has two parts -- the
main section and a back cap.    

58
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,158
the housing has two parts -- the
main section and a back cap.    
both go into an oven where the  

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,793
main section and a back cap.    
both go into an oven where the

that's because these cars race  
on an oval track in one         
direction only, so they're      

369
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:54,339

direction only, so they're      
making only left turns.         
next, they install a brake      

371
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:56,942
making only left turns.         
next, they install a brake

next, they install a brake      
rotor.                          
then, a steel spacing plate

rotor.                          
then, a steel spacing plate     
between the rotor and the wheel.

00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,279
then, a steel spacing plate     
between the rotor and the wheel.
this sets up the specific       

375
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,815
between the rotor and the wheel.
this sets up the specific       
distance from wheel to wheel    

376
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:08,185
this sets up the specific       
distance from wheel to wheel    
that nascar rules require.      

377
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,221
distance from wheel to wheel

into a brake caliper and slide  
the caliper onto the rotor.     

380
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:23,901
the caliper contains            
different-sized pistons so that 
it applies the brake pads to the

381
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:31,776
different-sized pistons so that 
it applies the brake pads to the
rotor evenly.

now they move onto the car's

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,482
inner workings.                 
they mount the transmission to  
an aluminum housing that covers

00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,784
they mount the transmission to  
an aluminum housing that covers 
the flywheel, clutch, and other

388
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:51,863
then they install the motor.    
it's an eight-cylinder, 750-plus
horsepower engine.              

389
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:08,079
they attach the car's plastic   
windshield with bolted clips.   
if air gets into the car, these

395
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:35,473
after bolting in the seat, they 
install the steering wheel.     
it has a safety release that
