00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,519
narrator: in the 18th century,      

4
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,322
anatomical models became widely
used for educational purposes. 

5
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,259
however, they were unique pieces
carved in wax,         

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,727
which made them expensive and fragile.     

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,330
today, they're made of plastic-based resin      

8
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,400
and are found in medical schools, doctors' offices,   

9
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,002
even art schools.       

10
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:17,909
this model of a human torso has 20 removable parts.    

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,147
the front, sides, and back all provide different views  

12
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,483
of the body's inner and outer structure.      

13
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,690
workers cast each part of the model     

14
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,360
using a plastic-based polymer resin.         

15
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,763
they pour the resin into nickel
molds of the different parts, 

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,766
like this skullcap mold...   

17
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,770
or this heart mold.      

18
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,508
then they join the two molds that make up each part     

19
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,976
and clamp them shut.      

20
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,119
the molds go into a gas oven set to 437 degrees fahrenheit. 

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,954
as the heat penetrates the molds,     

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,257
the resin evenly coats the entire inner surface.   

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,994
after about 10 to 12 minutes, they come out piping hot.   

24
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,397
workers spray them with water to cool them down       

25
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,568
before they unclamp the mold and release the warm casting. 

26
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,944
here are some shoulder muscles fresh from their mold...    

27
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:34,619
...the cross-section of a heart...         

28
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,990
an arm...           

29
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,361
...and a leg that workers set to cool into shape     

30
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,898
on a form made of heat-resistant gypsum. 

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,699
using a needle,        

32
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,103
a worker punctures the resin to release trapped air     

33
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,104
so the part doesn't shatter.  

34
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,906
then he drills small holes   

35
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,476
for the pins that will hold the parts together.      

36
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,582
each part is hand-painted to single out key features.  

37
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:10,589
an artist carefully paints in 
the veins in blue on this leg...

38
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,126
and then uses yellow for the nerve endings...    

39
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,763
and red for the arteries.   

40
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,434
even the toenails get some color.        

41
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,140
before they can assemble the model,           

42
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,077
workers must first insert metal pins into each part.   

43
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,280
they help attach the parts to one another.        

44
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,485
now the artist can finish painting in the arteries    

45
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,823
on this shoulder muscle.    

46
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,893
the gray areas indicate the ligaments.    

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,163
next, she turns her attention to the head,          

48
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:54,166
painting in the eyes first to give the figure some life. 

49
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,344
it's all in the details.    

50
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,217
this final touch really makes the eyes come alive.      

51
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,194
the parts go into a warm oven for about 15 minutes      

52
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,662
to soften the plastic.     

53
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,065
this makes them easier to assemble.      

54
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,734
here, a worker lowers the model's head        

55
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:34,005
onto a metal pin set in the torso.       

56
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,474
she puts the brain inside the model's skull       

57
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,977
and covers it with the skullcap.

58
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,281
next, she adds muscles to an arm,           

59
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,918
guiding the pin into a hole on the adjoining part.     

60
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:56,160
she adds the bicep, a muscle that helps flex the hand...   

61
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,762
and, finally, the deltoid,   

62
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,866
the muscle that lifts the arm at the shoulder joint.     

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
she tapes up the arm to keep all parts together   

64
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,978
as she attaches it to the torso.

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,246
nickel-plated hooks and fasteners         

66
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,650
hold the removable parts    
in place on the assembled model.

67
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:28,192
this life-size muscular figure measures in at 4 1/2 feet.   

68
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:32,130
it has 45 separate parts, all anatomically correct.   

69
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,538
the human body -- truly an extraordinary structure.  

70
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,418
narrator:           
the jukebox actually started out

71
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,620
as a memo-recording device for executives.        

72
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,223
that phonograph recorder was invented by thomas edison 

73
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,557
back in the 19th century.   

74
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,427
it evolved into a coin-operated music machine 

75
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,163
because music is a lot more fun to dance to 

76
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,467
than the boss' orders -- "take a memo."         

77
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:20,044
put a coin in the slot and people will dance to your tune.

78
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,647
records replaced the phonographic cylinder   

79
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,317
early in the 20th century.   

80
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,523
amplifiers were added in the 1930s          

81
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,394
and gave the big box a big sound.          

82
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,063
in the 1980s, compact discs came along,   

83
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,732
putting a different spin on the jukebox.        

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,734
with those smaller discs,   

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,706
manufacturers could pack    
a lot more music into a machine.

86
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,212
now compact-disc technology is becoming outdated,     

87
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,815
and the latest jukeboxes contain computers       

88
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,518
that download songs from the internet.       

89
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,496
to make a modern jukebox, they start with the door.   

90
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,966
they sandwich a red panel with swirled designs on it   

91
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,036
between layers of plastic.   

92
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,073
the assembler aligns them, then screws them together.   

93
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:33,051
he snaps the jukebox name into a snazzy piece of plastic,

94
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,519
then fits it in one of the cutouts     

95
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,354
in the front of the door.   

96
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,493
next, he installs aluminum framework around the door.   

97
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,199
he supports it at the corners with metal brackets.      

98
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,606
he screws a little metal wheel on the latch          

99
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,675
so the door will open and close smoothly. 

100
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:02,347
he mounts the touch screen in the big cutout on the door. 

101
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,218
he strings wiring for lighting 
around the perimeter of the door

102
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,020
and fastens two long panels equipped with l.e.d. lights  

103
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,223
to the back.          

104
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,234
he plugs in the lights for a test,          

105
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,969
and it proves this door is flashy enough        

106
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,838
for the entertainment biz.   

107
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,510
he runs plastic trim along the perimeter of the door

108
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,082
and screws a long metal hinge to one side of it.       

109
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,252
this jukebox door is now complete,        

110
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:44,856
and the rest is an inside job. 

111
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,058
the assembler installs an exhaust fan         

112
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,960
in the jukebox cabinet.    

113
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,199
he screws an audio amplifier to the back wall.       

114
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,270
the wireless router that allows the jukebox to connect to the internet 

115
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,272
goes in next.         

116
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,274
he mounts the power-supply system    

117
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,677
to the sidewall of the cabinet.

118
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,480
he tucks the computer into a lower corner of the box.

119
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,785
the power transformer for the 
amplifier goes on the back wall.

120
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,056
he installs an audio-control system    

121
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,558
just below the transformer.  

122
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:26,164
he connects the amplifier to the audio-control system,  

123
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:31,036
and then he wires the computer to the router.  

124
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,438
he hooks up a communication system     

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,375
that passes information between
all the devices in the jukebox.

126
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,049
and he installs a transformer for the speaker system.    

127
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,786
now the jukebox is ready for the showpiece -- 

128
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,790
that light-studded door with the touch screen.     

129
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:57,829
he screws the door's long hinge
to the cabinet.        

130
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,272
he inspects his installation job

131
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,809
and determines no adjustments are needed.   

132
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:15,080
so he fastens the bill box to the back of the door...   

133
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:19,684
and installs the computer hard drive in the cabinet.   

134
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,954
and, finally, the money test. 

135
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,423
he feeds the jukebox some cash 

136
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,994
and makes musical selections to check its function.     

137
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,430
at the jukebox factory,    

138
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,201
when the job is done, it really is party time.    

139
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,917
narrator: on their own, dipped in salsa or guacamole, 

140
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,852
or topped with chili and melted cheese,       

141
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,322
tortilla chips are the quintessential mexican snack, 

142
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,857
even though they're actually an american invention.     

143
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,061
in the late 1940s, a los angeles tortilla factory 

144
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,997
began cutting and frying leftover tortillas,      

145
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,333
selling the first tortilla chips.   

146
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,740
when the chips are down, they usually go fast.     

147
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,277
tortilla chips start out as raw yellow corn. 

148
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,679
the supplier cleans the kernels

149
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,216
and dries them to a moisture content of 14%, 

150
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,686
then ships them to the chip factory.      

151
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,691
there, the corn goes into large
stainless-steel cooking kettles

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,828
filled with almost-boiling water.     

153
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,030
workers then add lime,     

154
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,065
an ingredient that does many things.          

155
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,703
it's antibacterial, it gives the corn a parched flavor,   

156
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,506
it helps loosen the hull -- the kernel's shell --     

157
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,108
so it will come off later on, 

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,878
and lets moisture penetrate the kernel.     

159
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,920
each cook kettle contains more than 650 pounds of corn  

160
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:06,390
and almost 200 pounds of water and lime combined.  

161
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,659
next stop is a soak tank.   

162
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,529
the cooked corn sits there for 12 hours    

163
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,331
to further absorb water.    

164
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,933
once the moisture content hits 45%            

165
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,536
and the hulls are soft and loose,      

166
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:23,007
a pumping system moves the corn to the washer. 

167
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,209
this machine strains the water 

168
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,978
so that what's left is just soft, hydrated corn.  

169
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,151
the next stop is the tumbler, 

170
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,220
a rotating drum with perforated walls.     

171
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,524
water jets blow off the loose hulls.   

172
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:45,063
the corn travels on a conveyor from the tumbler to the mill.  

173
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:52,036
an auger feeds the corn into a stone grinder.     

174
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:56,174
it literally pulverizes the  
corn kernels between two stones,

175
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,244
producing a soft corn dough called masa.          

176
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,313
the masa exits the mill through a narrow nozzle    

177
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,982
that shapes the dough into a thin sheet.       

178
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,385
the sheet then runs through rollers   

179
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,221
that have triangular dies on their surface.       

180
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,403
the triangles move into an oven

181
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,072
heated to 644 degrees fahrenheit.    

182
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,741
they spend just 16 seconds inside,       

183
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,476
but that's enough time to dry the dough        

184
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,679
to the point where it won't break apart when handled.   

185
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,949
the heat also traps tiny pockets
of moisture in the dough,   

186
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,817
creating little blisters.   

187
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,621
this gives the tortilla chips their trademark bumpy texture. 

188
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,025
from the oven,         

189
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,029
a conveyor belt transports the triangles to the fryer.  

190
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,632
the corn oil is 360 degrees fahrenheit.   

191
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,703
they take just 55 seconds to fry into chips.       

192
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,309
a mesh conveyor belt then lifts them out.      

193
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,248
as they leave, the excess oil drains back into the fryer.  

194
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,849
at the next stop,       

195
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,919
augers feed nacho-flavor seasoning into a tumbler.   

196
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,322
the seasoning's main ingredients
are powdered cheddar,     

197
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,192
parmesan and romano cheeses, and spices.          

198
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,329
nozzles spray the chips with corn oil         

199
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,997
to make the surface adhesive. 

200
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,033
then the seasoning tumbles on and sticks.          

201
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,942
after exiting the tumbler,   

202
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,545
the chips travel to the packaging department.  

203
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,019
chutes route them       
to different packaging machines.

204
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,158
the packaging equipment    

205
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,528
represents technical choreography at its finest.  

206
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,901
each machine has 14 bucket-shaped scales.  

207
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,905
when there's enough for one package, a trap door opens.

208
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,107
the chips drop just as a forming device    

209
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,311
shapes a piece of foil and plastic film into a bag.  

210
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,252
the chips land in the bag.   

211
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,655
then a heat sealer immediately closes the top and cuts it free

212
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,593
while simultaneously sealing the bottom of the next bag.   

213
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,368
from bucket to bag to bowl.  

214
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,882
narrator: it takes a spark to get your motor running.   

215
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,284
the spark plug was invented in the 19th century      

216
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,287
to fire the internal-combustion engine.

217
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,622
there are usually several in an engine,         

218
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,825
and they fit into the cylinder head.    

219
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,560
when the plugs are all working,

220
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,530
it means your trip will have a good start.    

221
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,571
the spark plug produces what  
looks like a mini lightning bolt

222
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,008
to ignite the gas that runs your car.      

223
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,044
to make spark plugs,      

224
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,447
they blend alumina ceramic powder and other ingredients  

225
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,649
with water.          

226
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,717
after a thorough mixing,    

227
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,253
the milky-looking brew drains into a big dryer,    

228
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,689
which converts it back to powder.        

229
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,593
the powder funnels into a mold.

230
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,195
it closes to press the powder 

231
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,463
into the shape of spark-plug insulators,   

232
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,267
and a binding ingredient in the 
mix helps them keep their shape.

233
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,672
an automated system loads them onto mandrels    

234
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,543
that spin the ceramic insulators
against a grinding wheel.   

235
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,145
it grinds them into a more graduated shape  

236
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,116
and does a very precise job.  

237
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,553
these ceramic shapes are quite fragile,       

238
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,423
and they'll need to be baked in order to harden.      

239
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,162
but first, a tester double-checks the measurements 

240
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,197
with a laser tool.       

241
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,969
then they bake in this very hot kiln     

242
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,570
until they're extremely hard. 

243
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,440
this takes up to 24 hours.   

244
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,042
while the insulators are in the kiln,        

245
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,379
tools ram steel through shaped cavities called dies.  

246
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,648
they're essentially punching out shells      

247
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,217
that will be the spark-plug casings.    

248
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,191
other tools bore into the upper part of the shells  

249
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,193
to give them a hexagonal profile.      

250
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,995
this will later enable mechanics

251
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,199
to wrench them into a vehicle's engine block. 

252
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,069
more tooling contours the spark-plug shells,

253
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,105
and the result is quite a transformation.   

254
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,343
a conveyor now shuttles the spark-plug shells forward, 

255
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,146
as nickel-alloy wire unwinds overhead.       

256
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,550
an automated welder fuses the wire to the shells. 

257
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,685
this wire will serve as the spark plug's ground electrode, 

258
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,355
and it will be bent towards a firing electrode later.   

259
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,192
the space between them will contain the spark.    

260
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,235
ridged rollers carve threads in the steel shells      

261
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,071
so they can be screwed into the engine block.     

262
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:34,512
the shell then gets a protective silvery finish.  

263
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,047
the ceramic insulators are now out of the kiln,    

264
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,651
and it's time to roll on the insignia.    

265
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,987
the insulators then brush by a rubber wheel         

266
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:47,791
that coats them with glaze as a protective finish.    

267
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,795
they install center electrodes in the insulators,       

268
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,330
and powder funnels into them  

269
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,733
to fill the space around the electrodes.     

270
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:59,203
the powder is a mix of glass and metal.      

271
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:02,807
automated prongs compress it in the insulators. 

272
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,612
grippers then insert the terminal studs       

273
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,681
into the insulator.      

274
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,950
the stud will act as the electrical connection  

275
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,886
to the center electrode.    

276
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,356
the insulators now go into an oven.      

277
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:22,426
the black powder melts around the studs and center electrodes

278
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,196
to seal them inside the insulator cavity.  

279
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,704
nozzles squirt oil onto the metal shells to lubricate them.

280
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,641
the insulators funnel into the grip of robots    

281
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,709
which will install them in the shells.         

282
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,979
they slide in easily because of the lubrication job.

283
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,517
tools called shrinking punches 

284
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,786
apply an electrical current to each shell         

285
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,656
to fit it tightly to the insulator.       

286
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,129
a robot positions the assembly right side up         

287
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,131
with the side electrode protruding,          

288
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,568
then bends that side electrode towards the center one.    

289
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
the robot then collects the spark plugs 

290
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,611
and sends them down the line. 

291
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,016
it's time for an inspection.  

292
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:23,086
she looks for imperfections in the glaze, the inscription, 

293
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,155
and the nickel plating.    

294
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,025
she measures the space between the two electrodes   

295
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,661
before sending them over to the packaging department.  

296
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,831
and now these spark plugs   

297
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,970
are ready to keep your engine firing on all cylinders.    

298
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,781
