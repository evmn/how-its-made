00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,053
narrator: in the american wild west, the gun ruled,   

2
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,989
and that gun was usually a six-shooter revolver.     

3
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,392
today, replicas of those revolvers       

4
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,460
can take you back to dodge city,

5
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,263
and they do          
at cowboy shooting competitions.

6
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,732
it's a chance to engage    

7
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,169
in a little old-fashioned   
gunslinging for old times' sake.

8
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,341
with its six-shot cylinder   

9
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,343
and innovative cocking mechanism,       

10
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:22,815
the 1873 colt was carried by the likes of jesse james.  

11
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,019
they start these automatic replicas    

12
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,556
by shaping and machining the gun's frame.        

13
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,562
a computerized blade carves the cylinder.      

14
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,698
it cuts slots for the ammunition       

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,669
and notches for rotating the cylinder after a shot is fired.

16
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,642
a technician files down rough edges          

17
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:54,779
so the parts will fit together perfectly.           

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,916
he then screws the curved grip and the trigger guard     

19
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,685
to the frame.         

20
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,259
he assembles the wooden grip casing to the metal back strap 

21
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,529
and attaches them to the grip. 

22
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,931
once he confirms it's a good fit,        

23
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,469
he removes the casing the writes
the gun's serial number inside. 

24
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,139
he stamps a matching number onto the grip         

25
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,409
and polishes it and the gun's frame to a glossy finish.   

26
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,151
he now rolls the model number 

27
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,086
and other identifying information    

28
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,356
onto the gun's barrel.     

29
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:43,562
to add a bit of flourish, an artist engraves designs   

30
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,565
copying the artwork on an original colt.      

31
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:56,708
another worker now dips the parts in hot salts,    

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,578
then in cold water.      

33
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,646
a reaction occurs       

34
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,315
that both hardens the parts a bit and tints them.     

35
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,585
in this case, they turn a bronze color.   

36
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,120
this is called color case hardening.     

37
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,855
the grip and trigger guard   

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,325
have been removed from the gun frame for color casing.

39
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,394
this makes it easier for the technician       

40
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:20,532
to install the cartridge loading gate on the frame.   

41
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,402
he files down the mechanism for rotating the cylinder   

42
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,804
to make the dimensions perfect.

43
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,273
he then inserts a bushing and a pin           

44
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,542
in the cylinder's center.   

45
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,746
he uses that pin to install the cylinder in the gun frame. 

46
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,282
the pin will also serve as the axis          

47
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,018
for the cylinder to revolve on.

48
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,688
he slides a couple of test slugs
into the chambers       

49
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,757
to confirm the gap between the cylinder and gun frame   

50
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,027
is spot on.          

51
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,496
he then fits the gun barrel to the frame.         

52
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,899
and, using a special measuring rod,    

53
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,568
he checks the alignment of the cylinder and barrel.  

54
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,309
he tightens the barrel to the gun frame,       

55
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,411
using a stick as a lever.   

56
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,185
the technician aims the assembled gun       

57
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,188
and eyeballs the alignment of the barrel to the frame.  

58
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,256
once he's certain       

59
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,459
the configuration is right on target,      

60
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,828
he installs the gun's hammer and trigger.          

61
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,269
he pops the cylinder back into the gun frame    

62
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,806
and inserts the rod for ejecting spent ammunition. 

63
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,478
he screws a spring into the side of the hammer  

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,547
and cocks it          
in its three different positions

65
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,216
to verify that it's in working order.       

66
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,553
he then reattaches the grip and trigger guard.       

67
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,293
he assembles a flat spring to the curved grip.      

68
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,695
this is the main spring.    

69
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,765
it transfers energy from the trigger to the hammer 

70
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,933
to cause the revolver to fire. 

71
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,440
then it's over         
to a government testing facility

72
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,441
called the proof house.    

73
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,110
behind bulletproof glass,   

74
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,179
special equipment fires ammunition        

75
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,848
at three times the usual operating pressure. 

76
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,485
if the gun can handle this, it's deemed safe to operate.  

77
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,056
after a few more parts have been color cased,     

78
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,494
this revolver replica is ready for its target market.     

79
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,698
and that would be history buffs

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,336
who are interested in a real blast from the past. 

81
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,551
narrator: arc trainers can give you a full-body workout. 

82
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,953
they provide a number of exercise programs      

83
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,020
to choose from,        

84
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,957
like strength training, weight loss, and cardio.    

85
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,092
they monitor such things    

86
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,093
as heart rate and calories burned.      

87
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,696
like any piece of exercise equipment,     

88
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,433
using one properly is the key to a safe and healthy workout. 

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,639
arc trainers are made to give you          

90
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,042
a wide range of incline and resistance levels     

91
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,278
to let you train as easy or as hard as you like.     

92
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,183
to start, a tube laser     

93
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,120
machine-cuts and profiles the steel tubing        

94
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,689
that will make the arc trainer's side frame. 

95
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,466
a worker cleans the steel tubes,
then runs them         

96
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,736
through a computer-controlled roll-forming machine.     

97
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,539
this machine shapes all the steel         

98
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,108
used to build the arc trainer's frame.    

99
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,549
they use a robot to weld all the parts together     

100
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,620
because robotic welding is more consistent and accurate

101
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,188
than hand-welding.       

102
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,098
the completed frames then get a surface preparation,

103
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,034
giving the steel a uniform finish        

104
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,537
that is now ready for powder painting.      

105
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,176
workers then paint the frames 

106
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,911
using an electrostatic paint process.         

107
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,115
these guns spray electrically charged paint particles    

108
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,049
that are drawn to the grounded frames     

109
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,319
in a smooth and even coat.   

110
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,059
the frames then bake in an oven
for 40 minutes         

111
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,961
to cure the paint.       

112
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,802
next come the handlebars.   

113
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,205
a worker then makes them by lubricating a rubber tube  

114
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,741
and sliding it onto an assembly frame.    

115
00:07:56,743 --> 00:08:01,479
he then locks a preformed metal tube in place

116
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,849
and lubricates it as well.   

117
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,153
he turns a handwheel,     

118
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,423
which brings the two tubes together,    

119
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,025
forming the handgrip.     

120
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,128
he completes the assembly by screwing on an end cap.   

121
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,571
meanwhile, a worker assembles the control panel       

122
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,741
by putting on the overlays for the user interface.    

123
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,779
she then hooks up the printed circuit board   

124
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,882
that controls the unit.    

125
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,253
she closes the housing     

126
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,189
but leaves the connectors exposed     

127
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,092
for connection to the mainframe later.    

128
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,798
a worker then attaches a steel support fixture onto the frame.

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
next comes this drive-wheel assembly,   

130
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,070
which he bolts onto the support fixture.   

131
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,676
he puts a drive belt around a pulley        

132
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,211
that provides various resistance levels for the user 

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,548
and rolls the belt onto the drive wheel.     

134
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,553
he then uses a pneumatic tool to tighten down the pulley,  

135
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,222
which stretches the drive belt 

136
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,524
and sets it to the appropriate tension.  

137
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,496
next he attaches the computer board       

138
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,999
that controls the various fitness programs. 

139
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,704
a worker then installs the leg bars          

140
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,572
onto the arc trainer's frame  

141
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,442
and attaches a foot pedal onto each leg bar.       

142
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,251
he installs linkage bars onto the drive-wheel assembly. 

143
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,793
then he aligns the drive wheel 

144
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:58,530
and puts on the molded front housing...  

145
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,666
followed by the protective side covers.  

146
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,404
he connects a linkage bar   

147
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:10,609
that extends from each leg bar to the drive wheel,      

148
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,845
then connects one linkage bar to each arm handle.      

149
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,953
he makes sure all the linkage bars are working properly.   

150
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,024
finally, he tests       

151
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:29,360
the free-floating foot pedals and the dual-action arms,   

152
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,963
as well as all the other functions and features.     

153
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,500
these arc trainers are high-tech exercise machines.  

154
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,637
some models even come with a tv.           

155
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,514
narrator: used-oil furnaces generate heat

156
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,518
by burning used oil without having to refine it.  

157
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,254
these furnaces are found in automobile shops,      

158
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,990
maintenance facilities, and construction sites.    

159
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,126
transport fleets and trucking companies also use them    

160
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,195
to turn the used oil they produce          

161
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,665
into heat for their facilities.

162
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:16,141
it takes a special furnace to burn used oil.       

163
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,876
used oil is thick and dirty  

164
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,078
compared to residential fuel oil    

165
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,280
and must be turned into a fine mist        

166
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,615
to burn properly.       

167
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,687
it all starts with a computer-controlled laser  

168
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,890
making what's called the front and rear flue plates 

169
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,259
out of steel.         

170
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,161
the plates for this hot-air furnace    

171
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,430
are made of stainless or hot-rolled steel      

172
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,466
depending on the size of the unit.          

173
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,438
a worker then makes what's known as the heat exchanger  

174
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,574
by joining the flue plates together    

175
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,676
with steel tubes called flue tubes.       

176
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,252
this device is called a swagger machine.       

177
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,655
it expands just the ends of the flue tubes,       

178
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,525
binding them in place with the flue plate.      

179
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,669
next, he assembles the section in which hot gases collect   

180
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,004
after passing through the flue tubes     

181
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,973
on their way out of the furnace.      

182
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,146
he then sets a combustion chamber      

183
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,216
on the top of the heat exchanger     

184
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,051
and welds them together.    

185
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,088
he completes the heat-exchanger assembly  

186
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,826
by welding on a base equipped with two air-deflector plates. 

187
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,029
these square plates help direct the ambient air  

188
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,630
as it enters the furnace    

189
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,367
and circulates around the combustion chamber. 

190
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,909
meanwhile, an electrostatic powder-coating machine     

191
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,879
paints the outside covers for the furnace.        

192
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,984
next they put on inner air deflectors,    

193
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,087
then assemble the cabinet.   

194
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,428
they bolt everything in place, then put on an insulated door. 

195
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,605
now he hooks up a blower control box.     

196
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,473
this electrical box regulates 

197
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,609
when hot air is sent into a room.      

198
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,749
a worker then connects a tester box          

199
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,617
to the temperature controls  

200
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:44,421
that measure the temperature inside the furnace.      

201
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,690
he runs a number of tests   

202
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,893
to confirm that both the blower
and the burner         

203
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,929
will turn on or off when they're supposed to.   

204
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,501
he verifies the operation of the door          

205
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,737
that allows for cleaning out ash residue. 

206
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,510
a technician installs a 100-watt pencil heater    

207
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,646
inside a brass nozzle adaptor, 

208
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,182
then threads a thermostat into it.            

209
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,052
this nozzle adaptor heats the oil         

210
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:18,289
and turns it into a fine mist so it burns properly.     

211
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,196
she then attaches assembly fittings to the adaptor    

212
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,601
so she can later mount it inside a burner housing.    

213
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,075
she checks these fittings with a leveling tool      

214
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:42,212
to ensure the adaptor will go on straight inside the housing.

215
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,883
she also installs an assembly that controls oil flow,    

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,353
temperature, and air pressure. 

217
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,027
then she mounts the nozzle adaptor       

218
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,296
and covers it with a retention head     

219
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,564
that shapes the flame for optimal heat,       

220
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,401
completing the burner assembly.

221
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,305
a worker then hooks up     

222
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,840
the used-oil and compressed-air lines    

223
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,977
to begin testing the burner.  

224
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:17,381
he turns on the oil, ignites the burner,       

225
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,116
and looks through an observation port      

226
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,987
to verify the burner is working properly.      

227
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:29,527
a closer look shows the flame is at the right intensity   

228
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,730
for optimal heat with minimal emissions.    

229
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:37,101
the furnace is now ready to turn
used oil into useful heat.   

230
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,281
narrator: top-of-the-line pizza
cutters and vegetable peelers 

231
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,816
can be a pleasure to use.   

232
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,685
they make preparing and serving
your favorite foods      

233
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,087
quicker and easier       

234
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,491
and are ergonomically designed for style and comfort.     

235
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:04,929
they are also easy to clean and guaranteed for life.    

236
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,437
vegetable peelers and pizza cutters work like a charm,   

237
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,172
making straight cuts      

238
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,676
without damaging your pans or your fingers.        

239
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,380
quality pizza cutters start  

240
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:25,650
with cutlery-grade, high-carbon stainless steel  

241
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,187
from which a stamping press punches the cutter blades.   

242
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,393
the blades go         

243
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,795
through a three-step heat-treating process.     

244
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:43,200
first, they enter a high-temperature furnace.  

245
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,470
then it's into a deep freezer 

246
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:50,007
to maximize hardness and corrosion resistance.   

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,343
finally, they go into a tempering oven,     

248
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:57,215
which increases the durability of the metal.         

249
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,017
a polishing machine with two buffing heads     

250
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,687
then polishes both sides of the blade,         

251
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,490
giving it a protective and cosmetic finish.      

252
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:15,099
a worker than loads the blade onto a bevel-grinding machine 

253
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:18,069
that thins out the edge of the blade.         

254
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:25,243
it grinds a beveled edge    
that is thin enough to cut pizza

255
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,845
but not sharp enough to cut your finger       

256
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,581
or damage a cutting surface.  

257
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
a worker puts a steel-bar insert       

258
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,855
into an injection molding machine        

259
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:43,127
that makes the soft-polymer handle.    

260
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,030
he then cools it down in water.

261
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,137
he puts the handles on an extraction fixture    

262
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,806
which removes the inserts,   

263
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,408
making the handles ready for assembly          

264
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,610
along with all the other molded parts.    

265
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,215
he then attaches what's called 
a swing arm to the blade holder,

266
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,151
and he secures it in place with a screw.         

267
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,292
he dips the tip of the blade holder into lubricant     

268
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,828
and uses a pneumatic-assembly fixture  

269
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,233
to insert the blade holder into the handle permanently.  

270
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,773
using the swing arm,      

271
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,376
he snap-fits the blade onto the blade holder      

272
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,712
and hides the swing-arm screw with a cover cap.       

273
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:42,186
finally, he ensures the blade rolls properly and safely   

274
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,522
so it will cut through pizza with ease.           

275
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,458
the finest vegetable peelers  

276
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,095
also do their job quickly and effectively.    

277
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,667
they also start        

278
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,803
with cutlery-grade stainless-steel blades     

279
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,070
that undergo tempering     

280
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:04,308
to ensure the metal is durable and corrosion-resistant.    

281
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,681
after cleaning and polishing, 

282
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,883
the blades are dried in a vibrating medium     

283
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,418
of ground corncob,       

284
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,954
then removed from the tub by a magnet.          

285
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,826
the blades are now ready for sharpening.        

286
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,163
a worker mounts the peeler blades       

287
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,099
on a computer-controlled edge-grinding machine.     

288
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:37,241
the grinder sharpens one edge of each blade at a time.    

289
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,315
once both sides of the peeler blades are fully sharpened,  

290
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,884
they're ready for assembly.  

291
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,724
meanwhile, an injection molding machine  

292
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,760
makes the blade holders.    

293
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:03,667
a worker dips each blade holder
into lubricant         

294
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,871
and inserts it into the molded soft-polymer handle,      

295
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,473
joining them together permanently.          

296
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,150
finally, he attaches the blade 

297
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,218
by deflecting the holder just enough          

298
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,422
to insert the tip of the blade into a tiny hole.       

299
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,493
these top-quality vegetable peelers       

300
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,296
are sold individually or in combination       

301
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,765
with other kitchen utensils like pizza cutters,      

302
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,702
and they sure are handy in the kitchen --       

303
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,837
even if you're not.
