he uses different tools to create finer effects    

302
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,895
such as veining.        

303
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,898
this age-old technique of hammering a malleable metal 

304
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,034
from the reverse side to create a design in relief  

305
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:35,306
is called repoussé, french for "pushed back".   

306
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,842
the artist heats a part with a torch          

307
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,446
and applies zinc chloride flux to the parameter.       

308
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,048
this caustic solution cleans the copper,          

309
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,686
removing impurities that would prevent solder from adhering. 

310
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,658
then he uses a blowtorch to melt silver-based solder  

311
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,793
onto the copper,        

312
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,862
around the parameter of the part.   

313
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,203
this step is called pre-soldering,         

314
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,139
as the sculpture will be fully soldered later. 

315

♪          

316
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,616
he pre-solders the back of the pieces         

317
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,619
that will be attached to matching pieces.      

318
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,688
then he heats the front surface

319
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,224
to bring out a rainbow of colors.      

320
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,627
next, he aligns the matching parts       

321
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,629
and heats them with a torch.  

322
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,032
this melts the solder along the
parameter,           

323
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,901
fusing the pieces together.  

324
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,438
in areas where the sides are too
far apart to be fused,     

325
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,042
he solders a small copper patch
to fit over the gap.      

326
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,580
he flattens all the seams with fine grinding tools    

327
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,649
until they appear seamless.  

328
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:56,387
he repeats this process for each section of the sculpture. 

329
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,656
once all the sections are assembled,         

330
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,725
he solders them to each other. 

331
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,531
the wing fits into a thin channel         

332
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,933
he hammered into the body of the sculpture.       

333
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,935
he melts the solder in the channel         

334
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,138
to produce a neat and even seam.

♪          

336
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,148
to display the copper sculpture
or use it as a weather vane,  

337
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,083
the artist solders a ball bearing         

338
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,019
inside a copper tube,     

339
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:33,091
then attaches the tube to the bottom of the sculpture.

340
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,826
the tube slides over a rod,  

341
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,329
so it can be set in the ground or mounted on the roof.
