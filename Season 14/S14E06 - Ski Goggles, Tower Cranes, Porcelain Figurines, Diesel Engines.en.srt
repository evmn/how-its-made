a crane's tower is modular,     
meaning the more tower sections 
installation crews add, the     

121
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,583
meaning the more tower sections 
installation crews add, the     
taller the crane.               

122
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:33,792
at the crane factory, workers   
construct the slueing platform  
by welding together huge steel  

123
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:39,331
construct the slueing platform  
by welding together huge steel  
plates and square tubes.        

124
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,266
by welding together huge steel  
plates and square tubes.        
welders also fuse sections of   

125
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,068
plates and square tubes.        
welders also fuse sections of   
ladder to sections of safety

00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:49,341
cage.                           
then they weld each ladder and  
cage unit to a tower section.   

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,343
then they weld each ladder and

after lubricating the grooves,  
workers install the outer ring  

148
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,326
after lubricating the grooves,  
workers install the outer ring  
around the inner one.           

149
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:49,334
then they fill the groove with  
steel balls and high-strength   
plastic spacers.                

150
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,169

space underneath to insert an   
additional tower section.       

198
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:07,172
they connect the tower sections 
with giant high-strength bolts. 
then, repeat this procedure     

199
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,007
with giant high-strength bolts. 
then, repeat this procedure     
until the crane is as high as it

200
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,211
then, repeat this procedure     
until the crane is as high as it
needs to be.                    

201
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,146
until the crane is as high as it
needs to be.                    
once the crane is fully erected,

202
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,882
needs to be.                    
once the crane is fully erected,

greener cars, but with more     
powerful acceleration than      

307
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,420
greener cars, but with more     
powerful acceleration than      
hybrids deliver, can opt for a  

308
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,189
powerful acceleration than      
hybrids deliver, can opt for a  
vehicle that runs on diesel.    

309
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,924
hybrids deliver, can opt for a  
vehicle that runs on diesel.    
today's diesel fuel burns as    

310
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,526
vehicle that runs on diesel.    
today's diesel fuel burns as    
cleanly as gasoline, yet        

311
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,494
today's diesel fuel burns as

diesel-powered cars are 30% more
fuel efficient than gas-powered 

313
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,365
diesel-powered cars are 30% more
fuel efficient than gas-powered 
cars, meaning they consume less 

314
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,100
fuel efficient than gas-powered 
cars, meaning they consume less

316
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,876
the secret behind this car's    
powerful diesel engine is a     
turbocharger.                   

317
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,478
powerful diesel engine is a     
turbocharger.                   
it compresses the air entering  

318
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,213
turbocharger.                   
it compresses the air entering  
the engine's combustion chambers

319
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,681
it compresses the air entering  
the engine's combustion chambers
filling them with a greater     

320
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,583

filling them with a greater     
quantity of air.                

321
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:26,518
filling them with a greater     
quantity of air.                
the more air, the better the    

322
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,486
quantity of air.                
the more air, the better the    
fuel burns, generating extra    

323
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,387
the more air, the better the    
fuel burns, generating extra    
power.                          

324
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,122
fuel burns, generating extra    
power.                          
the engine assembly begins with 

325
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,924
power.                          
the engine assembly begins with 
a v-shaped block with two sets  

326
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,492
the engine assembly begins with 
a v-shaped block with two sets  
of three cylindrical holes      

327
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,327
a v-shaped block with two sets  
of three cylindrical holes      
called cylinders.               

328
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,195
of three cylindrical holes      
called cylinders.               
robots first mount a retaining  

329
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,065
called cylinders.               
robots first mount a retaining  
frame to support the crankshaft.

330
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,799
robots first mount a retaining  
frame to support the crankshaft.
each cylinder will contain a    

331
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,568
frame to support the crankshaft.
each cylinder will contain a    
piston that moves up and down   

332
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,203
each cylinder will contain a    
piston that moves up and down   
with the combustion cycle.      

333
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,171
piston that moves up and down   
with the combustion cycle.      
this piston motion will turn the

334
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,007
with the combustion cycle.      
this piston motion will turn the
crankshaft which, in turn, will 

335
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,476
this piston motion will turn the
crankshaft which, in turn, will 
move the whole vehicle.         

336
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,344
crankshaft which, in turn, will 
move the whole vehicle.         
but first, a laser-beam device  

337
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,779
move the whole vehicle.         
but first, a laser-beam device  
hones the cylinders.            

338
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,480
but first, a laser-beam device  
hones the cylinders.            
the laser's heat melts the      

339
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,249
hones the cylinders.            
the laser's heat melts the      
surface of the inner walls,     

340
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,350
the laser's heat melts the      
surface of the inner walls,     
smoothing them.                 

341
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,952
surface of the inner walls,     
smoothing them.                 
this ensures the pistons will   

342
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,488
smoothing them.                 
this ensures the pistons will   
move with minimal friction.     

343
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,623
this ensures the pistons will   
move with minimal friction.     
meanwhile, a robot oils up the  

344
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,592

meanwhile, a robot oils up the  
crankshaft's main bearings.     

345
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,360
meanwhile, a robot oils up the  
crankshaft's main bearings.     
then, once the cylinder honing  

346
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,029
crankshaft's main bearings.     
then, once the cylinder honing  
is done, workers install the    

347
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,030
then, once the cylinder honing  
is done, workers install the    
crankshaft at the bottom of the 

348
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,665
is done, workers install the    
crankshaft at the bottom of the 
engine block, locking it in     

349
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,902
crankshaft at the bottom of the 
engine block, locking it in     
position with a retaining frame.

350
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,769
engine block, locking it in     
position with a retaining frame.
now they flip the engine block  

351
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,372
position with a retaining frame.
now they flip the engine block  
right side up to install the    

352
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,973
now they flip the engine block  
right side up to install the    
pistons, which are already      

353
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,876
right side up to install the    
pistons, which are already      
attached to connecting rods.    

354
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:33,217
once all six pistons are in,    
they turn the engine block      
upside down again and fasten    

355
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,986
they turn the engine block      
upside down again and fasten    
each connecting rod around the  

356
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,255
upside down again and fasten    
each connecting rod around the  
crankshaft.                     

357
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,630
next, they connect the chain    
drive to one end of the         
crankshaft.                     

358
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,064
drive to one end of the         
crankshaft.                     
the chain drive operates        

359
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,800
crankshaft.                     
the chain drive operates        
camshafts that open and close   

360
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,335
the chain drive operates        
camshafts that open and close   
the valves on top of the        

361
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,504
camshafts that open and close   
the valves on top of the        
cylinders.                      

362
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,679
those valves are located in     
these cylinder heads, four      
valves per cylinder -- two      

363
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,413
these cylinder heads, four      
valves per cylinder -- two      
through which air enters the    

364
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,015
valves per cylinder -- two      
through which air enters the    
combustion chamber and two      

365
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,617
through which air enters the    
combustion chamber and two      
through which exhaust exits     

366
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:10,154
combustion chamber and two      
through which exhaust exits     
following each combustion cycle.

367
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,889
through which exhaust exits     
following each combustion cycle.
workers flip the heads upside   

368
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,491
following each combustion cycle.
workers flip the heads upside   
down and insert long bolts.     

369
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,193
workers flip the heads upside   
down and insert long bolts.     
then they position the heads    

370
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,094
down and insert long bolts.     
then they position the heads    
over the cylinders, aligning the

371
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,896
then they position the heads    
over the cylinders, aligning the
bolts with holes in the engine  

372
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:19,497
over the cylinders, aligning the
bolts with holes in the engine  
block.                          

373
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,499
bolts with holes in the engine  
block.                          
robots drive in the bolts to a  

374
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,834
block.                          
robots drive in the bolts to a  
specific tightness.             

375
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,036
robots drive in the bolts to a  
specific tightness.             
this caps each cylinder, closing

376
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:27,539
specific tightness.             
this caps each cylinder, closing
its combustion chamber.         

377
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:35,313
next, workers install a fuel    
injector into special shafts in 
each cylinder head.             

378
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,981
injector into special shafts in 
each cylinder head.             
injectors shoot a specific      

379
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,449
each cylinder head.             
injectors shoot a specific      
amount of fuel into the         

380
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,317
injectors shoot a specific      
amount of fuel into the         
combustion chambers at precisely

381
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,252
amount of fuel into the         
combustion chambers at precisely
the right time.                 

382
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,054
combustion chambers at precisely
the right time.                 
these cutting-edge piezo        

383
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,289
the right time.                 
these cutting-edge piezo        
injectors do that multiple times

384
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,458
these cutting-edge piezo        
injectors do that multiple times
per cycle rather than just once,

385
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,560
injectors do that multiple times
per cycle rather than just once,
making the combustion process   

386
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,662
per cycle rather than just once,
making the combustion process   
much smoother.                  

387
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,363
making the combustion process   
much smoother.                  
the engine, therefore, is       

388
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,065
much smoother.                  
the engine, therefore, is       
quieter and pollutes less.      

389
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,700
the engine, therefore, is       
quieter and pollutes less.      
the next component is the       

390
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,068
quieter and pollutes less.      
the next component is the       
air-intake manifold.            

391
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,004
the next component is the       
air-intake manifold.            
it goes on top of the engine.   

392
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,072
air-intake manifold.            
it goes on top of the engine.   
air enters on the left and, as  

393
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,008
it goes on top of the engine.   
air enters on the left and, as  
this animation shows, runs to   

394
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,176
air enters on the left and, as  
this animation shows, runs to   
the intake valves on top of the 

395
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,845
this animation shows, runs to   
the intake valves on top of the 
cylinders.                      

396
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,480
the intake valves on top of the 
cylinders.                      
it's time to install this       

397
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,282
cylinders.                      
it's time to install this       
engine's secret weapon, the     

398
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,350
it's time to install this       
engine's secret weapon, the     
turbocharger.                   

399
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,020
engine's secret weapon, the     
turbocharger.                   
it contains two turbine wheels  

400
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:18,156
turbocharger.                   
it contains two turbine wheels  
that spin at nearly 200,000 rpm.

401
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,691
it contains two turbine wheels  
that spin at nearly 200,000 rpm.
one turbine compresses air      

402
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,158
that spin at nearly 200,000 rpm.
one turbine compresses air      
entering the air-intake         

403
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,826
one turbine compresses air      
entering the air-intake         
manifold.                       

404
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,427
entering the air-intake         
manifold.                       
the other draws out the hot     

405
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,062
manifold.                       
the other draws out the hot     
exhaust and sends it out the    

406
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,365
the other draws out the hot     
exhaust and sends it out the    
car's exhaust pipe.             

407
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:37,375
the turbocharger sits at the    
rear of the engine block in the 
"v" between the cylinders.      

408
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,517
over at the testing department, 
technicians analyze the engine's
performance, in particular, its 

409
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,252
technicians analyze the engine's
performance, in particular, its 
torque, which determines how    

410
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,721
performance, in particular, its 
torque, which determines how    
much power the engine can       

411
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:51,489
torque, which determines how    
much power the engine can       
produce.                        

412
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:02,400
next, the engine goes into a    
test vehicle which runs through 
specific driving cycles that    

413
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,402
test vehicle which runs through 
specific driving cycles that    
simulate both highway and city  

414
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,903
specific driving cycles that    
simulate both highway and city  
conditions, all the while       

415
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,672
simulate both highway and city  
conditions, all the while       
collecting the emissions exiting

416
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,507
conditions, all the while       
collecting the emissions exiting
out the exhaust pipe.           

417
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,208
collecting the emissions exiting
out the exhaust pipe.           
this test insures that the      

418
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,077
out the exhaust pipe.           
this test insures that the      
engine meets or exceeds all the 

419
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,380
this test insures that the      
engine meets or exceeds all the 
emission standards.             

420
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,218
not only does the turbocharger  

421
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,420
give the car better             

422
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,355
acceleration, it also solves a  

423
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,257
common problem in high-altitude 

424
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,959
regions, where decreased        

425
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,027
atmospheric pressure slows down 

426
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,295
nonturbo engines.               

427
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,297
because turbocharging compresses

428
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,166
the air going into the engine,  

429
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,134
even at high altitudes, the car 

430
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,604
drives at full power.
