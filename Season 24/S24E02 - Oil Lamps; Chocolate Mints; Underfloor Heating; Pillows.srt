00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,640
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,984
 narrator: before the invention 
         of electricity,        

4
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,120
      humans relied on fire     
           for light.           

5
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,189
         candles dripped        
       and could be messy.      

6
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,191
         oil lamps were         
     a cleaner alternative.     

7
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,861
      initially, oil lamps      
    were dishes of animal fat   

8
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,796
      with floating wicks.      

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,665
   but they evolved and became  
        a source of both        

10
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,367
        beauty and light.       

11
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,206
      in the 18th century,      

12
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,541
         a swiss chemist        
      invented an oil lamp      

13
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,278
     with a cylindrical wick    
          and chimney.          

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,414
  the updated design increased  
   air flow to create a flame   

15
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,617
     that was both smokeless    
          and brighter.         

16
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,889
      in colonial america,      
 pewter versions became popular.

17
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,259
           and today,           
 a fifth generation pewtersmith 

18
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,463
     keeps this handcrafted     
        tradition alive.        

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,534
 he starts with the maker's mark

20
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,035
       and stamps it into       
         the pewter base        

21
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,305
  of the lamp's oil reservoir.  

22
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,377
  he clamps another pewter disc 
           in a lathe           

23
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,948
  against an aluminum template  
     for the reservoir body.    

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,786
       as the disc spins,       

25
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,789
  he shapes it to the template  
       with a tool called       

26
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,257
       a spinner's finger.      

27
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,727
        this takes skill.       

28
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,797
      if he works too fast      
  or applies too much pressure, 

29
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,832
     the pewter will break.     

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,873
     his first spin produces    
        the basic shape.        

31
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,809
        in the next spin,       
       he trims the edges.      

32
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,145
  he also rounds the lower half 
        of the reservoir        

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,281
   using the spinner's finger.  

34
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,354
   he works freestyle to match  
 the contours of the lower half 

35
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,222
       to the upper half.       

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,196
       he trims the bottom      
         one more time.         

37
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,967
     during the third spin,     

38
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,437
    he fine-tunes the shape,    
   and cuts a hole in the top.  

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,008
     then, he sizes the hole    
     for the burner collar.     

40
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,912
    this metal is transformed   
        from a basic dome       

41
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,848
     to a well-rounded lid.     

42
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,918
  the oil lamp reservoir is now 
      ready for the burner.     

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,122
      he presses the collar     
         into the hole.         

44
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,457
        then, he brushes        
      a glycerin-based flux     

45
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,860
         onto the collar        
    in the neck of the lamp.    

46
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,731
   the flux prevents oxidation  
  and helps solder flow easily  

47
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,568
 as he secures the burner collar
          to the neck.          

48
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,276
 next, he tack solders the base 
          to the bottom         

49
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,278
    of the oil lap reservoir.   

50
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,420
      he applies more flux      
      and solders the seam      

51
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,821
       all the way around.      

52
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,958
  the tin-bismuth solder melts  
 at a slightly lower temperature

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,493
      than the pewter does.     

54
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,429
     this is delicate work.     

55
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,766
   if the torch gets too hot,   
  he'll melt the entire piece.  

56
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,768
  with the soldering complete,  

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,405
       he trims the excess      
   from the base of the lamp.   

58
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,976
        he files the seam       
       until it's smooth.       

59
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,714
     then he sands the rest     
    of the oil lamp reservoir   

60
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,549
        to a satin sheen.       

61
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,055
   another member of the team   
         sands the base         

62
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,824
     up to the maker's mark.    

63
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:28,533
   next, the pewtersmith rolls  
 a beaded motif into the metal. 

64
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:32,471
 it's a design option that makes
  the lamp look more elaborate. 

65
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,008
    or for a different look,    

66
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,445
  he gently creates a hammered  
    texture around the lamp.    

67
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,018
     using an engraving pen,    

68
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,553
     the pewtersmith etches     
          his signature         

69
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,988
   onto the base of the lamp.   

70
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,896
    with the burner and wick    
           installed,           

71
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,166
 the lamp is ready for packing. 

72
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,967
     plenty of tissue paper     
            is needed           

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,569
         to protect both        
        the glass chimney       

74
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,272
      and the nickel burner     
          from damage.          

75
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,248
     she includes operation     
  and maintenance instructions. 

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,184
         unlike silver,         
     pewter doesn't tarnish,    

77
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,388
        but will develop        
   a richer veneer over time.   

78
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,861
         a few scratches        
  or handling marks are normal, 

79
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,662
      but they'll only add      
          authenticity          

80
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,932
       to this traditional      
          light source.         

81
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,272
      like pewter oil lamps     
        of another time,        

82
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:45,344
  these replicas are a shining  
  example of handcraftsmanship. 

83
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,557
 narrator: chocolates and mints 
   are enjoyed by many people.  

84
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,027
then, someone discovered putting
        the two together        

85
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,232
            makes for           
     a delicious experience.    

86
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,901
 the cool zestiness of the mint 
   offsets the rich creaminess  

87
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,102
        of the chocolate.       

88
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,439
    it is one of the sweetest   
    matches in candy history.   

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,579
       chocolate or mint?       

90
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,181
    with the chocolate mint,    
      the decision is easy      

91
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,651
     because the two flavors    
      are wrapped into one.     

92
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,119
    to make chocolate mints,    

93
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,122
     they pump liquid sugar     
      into a heated mixer,      

94
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,958
     and add granular sugar.    

95
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,399
       the mixer blends it      
      into simmering syrup      

96
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,702
   exiting through strainers.   

97
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,740
      then, it's moved into     
     a vacuum-sealed cooker.    

98
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,942
      it sucks out moisture     
     and the syrup thickens     

99
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,411
  to a jelly-like consistency.  

100
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,547
      a worker transfers it     
        to a second mixer       

101
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,484
  and adds the mint flavoring.  

102
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,819
   thorough mixing thickens it  

103
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,255
     and lightens the color     
         substantially.         

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,429
 he transfers the mint flavored 
     candy to a work table.     

105
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,499
    powerful mechanical arms    
        massage the slab        

106
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,701
  to cool and harden the candy. 

107
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:25,109
next, a hopper funnels the candy
    into pressurized rollers    

108
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,846
         that squeeze it        
       into a long sheet.       

109
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,751
         the sheet rides        
     an inclining conveyor.     

110
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,452
    once it reaches the top,    

111
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,323
    an employee wraps the end   
    around a long steel tube.   

112
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,397
  the tube revolves and twists  
    the mint candy around it.   

113
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,667
      the long candy sheet      
  takes the shape of the tube.  

114
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,805
    they melt and mix chunks    
  of pure chocolate with cocoa, 

115
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,876
         powdered milk,         
        and icing sugar.        

116
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,744
      they add coconut oil      
          and lecithin          

117
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,580
    to bind the ingredients.    

118
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,085
    once mixed, the employee    
    transfers it to a hopper    

119
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,521
      next to the big mint      
           candy tube.          

120
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,292
           from here,           
    the chocolate is injected   

121
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,761
       into the hollow of       
      the mint candy tube.      

122
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,904
 the tube rolls off the forming 
 cylinder and passes by rollers 

123
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:30,975
 that squeeze the diameter down 
         to a rope size.        

124
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,512
     a compactor then mashes    
         the candy rope         

125
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,915
       to give the filling      
      a honeycomb texture.      

126
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,388
  pullers now stretch a second  
       slab of mint candy       

127
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,958
        until it thickens       
   and turns a lighter color.   

128
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,695
 the worker cuts it into chunks 

129
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,064
          that fit into         
    the next rolling machine.   

130
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,069
      it presses the candy      
          into a sheet          

131
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,906
   which then lands on top of   
       the mint chocolate.      

132
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,813
    the two layers now enter    
    the next forming machine.   

133
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,415
 this one wraps the outer layer 

134
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,817
             around             
   the chocolate infused one,   

135
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,321
   creating a chocolate filled  
           mint tube.           

136
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,727
   rollers reduce the diameter  
    to half an inch in size.    

137
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,967
  next, the chocolate mint rope 
      enters a die cutter.      

138
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,737
   it shapes and cuts the rope  
           into mints.          

139
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,711
 the mints spill into a spreader
  which distributes them evenly 

140
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,047
  across a perforated conveyor. 

141
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,583
 fans blow air through the holes
         in the conveyor        

142
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,386
      to cool and solidify      
          the candies.          

143
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,593
 once the candies have hardened,

144
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,197
          they head to          
      the wrapping station.     

145
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,801
   here, they ride a rotating   
        circular platform       

146
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,736
 and fall into candy-size slots.

147
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,611
   glossy metalized film wrap   
            unwinds.            

148
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,812
     mechanical arms collect    
       the chocolate mints      

149
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,149
 as they fall out of the slots. 

150
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,150
      they hold the candies     
          for wrapping          

151
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,886
  while devices twist the ends. 

152
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,692
    it takes only a fraction    
  of a second to wrap a candy.  

153
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,829
          then it's on          
       to a weigh station.      

154
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,765
 scales release the individually
     wrapped chocolate mints    

155
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,765
         in increments.         

156
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,068
       they fall into bags      
        ready for retail.       

157
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,108
          approximately         
      2,400 chocolate mints     

158
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,312
      are made every minute     
        at this factory.        

159
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,916
   two flavors in one candy --  
     they're quite a treat.     

160
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,064
         heating a room         
using a water circulation system

161
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:10,669
     under the floor is more    
efficient than using a radiator.

162
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,072
      radiators can only be     
      at one end of a room,     

163
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,407
   while a circulation system   
        distributes heat        

164
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,510
       evenly throughout.       

165
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,350
 warm water pipes are installed 
         under the floor        

166
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,552
       beneath the plaster      
         leveling layer         

167
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,821
        in the grooves of       
       a plastic guide mat      

168
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,889
      laid on the subfloor.     

169
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:36,494
    each pipe begins and ends   
   at a distribution manifold.  

170
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,097
      the pipes connect to      
   the manifold and each other  

171
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,367
       with various types       
       of brass fittings.       

172
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,768
 this computer guided equipment 

173
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,204
        makes the simpler       
         straight ones.         

174
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:53,578
      it first cuts a piece     
     from a long brass bar,     

175
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,513
    progressively shapes it,    
        bores through it,       

176
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,282
     and cuts threads on it.    

177
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,523
   this machine makes the nuts  
    that connect the fittings   

178
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,225
        to the manifold.        

179
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,863
    the machine cuts a piece    
   from a six-sided brass bar   

180
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,899
    and shapes it into a nut.   

181
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,204
   curved or t-shaped fittings  

182
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,806
      require forging prior     
          to machining.         

183
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,542
    the factory cuts the bars   
          into ingots.          

184
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:28,212
 a conveyor then feeds the ingot
          into an oven.         

185
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:32,617
  the high temperature softens  
 the brass to a malleable state.

186
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,418
 after the ingots exit the oven,

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,956
  they are pressed into a mold  
       by a 400-ton press.      

188
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,564
    when the press releases,    

189
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:51,302
       the forged fitting       
   heads to a collection bin.   

190
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,039
 workers then place it on a die 
  and trim off the excess brass 

191
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,342
       with a punch press.      

192
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,983
         the fitting now        
      has its basic shape.      

193
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,787
       the next step is to      
          sandblast it.         

194
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,456
     this cleans the surface    
  in preparation for machining. 

195
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,326
   a vibrating tray now feeds   
    the sandblasted fittings    

196
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,328
           to a robot.          

197
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,798
a camera records the orientation
         of each piece,         

198
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,735
  guiding the robot to load it  
    in the correct position.    

199
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,208
      guided by a computer,     

200
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,813
 the transfer machine finalizes 
    the shape of the fitting.   

201
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,152
 this complex machining process,
 seen here in super slow motion,

202
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,289
    takes just a few seconds.   

203
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,757
 the transfer machine also makes
          the manifold          

204
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,028
    from a larger brass bar.    

205
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,696
          this manifold         
       has 10 connections.      

206
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,967
   so if each room of the home  
    is heated by one circuit,   

207
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,570
   this manifold could control  
            10 rooms.           

208
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,907
the transfer machine can perform
  up to 20 different operations 

209
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,942
      on a single fitting.      

210
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,048
  the under floor heating pipes 
        have five layers.       

211
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,850
  to produce the innermost one, 

212
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,053
   an extruder melts granules   
       of polyethylene --       

213
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,124
    a strong non-porous type    
           of plastic.          

214
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,260
      it is pushed through      
         a circular die,        

215
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,796
     and then cooled rapidly    
        to a solid state.       

216
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,533
    polyethylene pipe enters    
        a second extruder       

217
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:32,803
  that applies a layer of glue  
         over the poly.         

218
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,940
        the glue adheres        
  the third layer -- aluminum.  

219
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,876
     the pipe moves through     
   a series of forming rollers  

220
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,679
      which gradually wrap      
  an aluminum strip around it.  

221
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,087
    this aluminum layer makes   
  the polyethylene pipe strong. 

222
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,222
 once the pipe is fully encased,

223
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,127
     a welding machine fuses    
 the strip's overlapping edges. 

224
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:04,101
      the pipe now receives     
     another layer of glue.     

225
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,672
     then, the outer surface    
   of polyethylene is applied.  

226
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,980
     the factory makes pipes    
    ranging from 1/2 an inch    

227
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,450
  to 3 1/2 inches in diameter.  

228
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,853
    a steel sleeve is pressed   
          over the end,         

229
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,655
       connecting the pipe      
         to the fitting.        

230
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,190
  to set up the heating system, 

231
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,660
  the installers lay a plastic  
    guide mat on the subfloor   

232
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,264
        and snap the pipe       
     into the mat's grooves.    

233
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,800
 they lay plaster leveling tiles
        on top of the mat       

234
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,004
      to level the surface      
   then install the flooring.   

235
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,407
they connect one end of the pipe
      to an inlet manifold,     

236
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,344
   and the other to an outlet   
            manifold.           

237
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,746
   the inlet sends warm water   
        through the pipe.       

238
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:52,216
       the outlet receives      
    the returning cold water    

239
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,819
   and sends it to the boiler   
         to be reheated.        

240
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,755
     you regulate water flow    
 and temperature either manually

241
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:01,292
      or with a thermostat.     

242
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,303
            narrator:           
   hard, soft, puffy or flat,   

243
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,704
 the type of pillow you sleep on

244
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,973
         is a matter of         
      personal preference.      

245
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,042
   your pillow can be stuffed   
      with natural fillings     

246
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,512
     like feathers and wool,    
     or synthetic materials     

247
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,482
          such as foam          
       or polyester fiber.      

248
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,658
      these pillows come in     
          two styles --         

249
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,727
   garnet pillows filled with   
   a roll of synthetic fiber,   

250
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:42,400
    and blown pillows made of   
     loose synthetic fibers.    

251
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:46,737
the fiber arrives at the factory
  in huge, densely packed bales 

252
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,140
   weighing almost 600 pounds.  

253
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,543
  this polyester fiber is made  
        from polyethylene       

254
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,580
  and other types of plastics.  

255
00:16:55,582 --> 00:17:00,017
    the fibers are all stuck    
            together.           

256
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,287
  they need to be pulled apart  
        and smoothed out.       

257
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,691
     this process is called     
      "opening the fibers."     

258
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,694
      the first machine --      
        the preopener --        

259
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,697
  combs the fibers with a large 
      steel-spiked roller.      

260
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,302
this separates them considerably
       but not completely.      

261
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:21,973
   the fibers exit the machine  
    straighter and smoother.    

262
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,642
            however,            
   several are still crimped.   

263
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,247
  the preopener's four outputs  
         drop the fibers        

264
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,183
      onto a conveyor belt      
        which takes them        

265
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,285
  to the next opening machine.  

266
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,724
  along the way, nozzles spray  
       a special solution       

267
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,092
  to reduce static electricity. 

268
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,999
     to make garnet pillows,    

269
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,402
      fans push the fibers      
   to another opening machine   

270
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,472
    called the garnet hopper.   

271
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,675
    it feeds the fibers onto    
     a spiked conveyor belt     

272
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,077
  which combs them out further. 

273
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,482
        this removes many       
    of the remaining crimps.    

274
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,217
    after the garnet hopper,    

275
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,686
  the fibers look like the ones 
         on the right --        

276
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:12,089
      fluffier, straighter,     
          and smoother.         

277
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,426
      the fibers now travel     
      to the next machine.      

278
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,761
  it has several metal rollers  
        with sharp ridges       

279
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,764
          that stretch          
       the fiber straight,      

280
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,966
 removing the remaining crimps. 

281
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,238
      the fibers then enter     
        another machine,        

282
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,242
 passing over one of two rollers
  to form a flat, fluffy sheet  

283
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,510
         called a "web."        

284
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,513
       the two webs merge       
    as they exit the machine,   

285
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,182
     forming a thicker web.     

286
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,185
     then, the next machine     
   laps the web back and forth  

287
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,455
          over itself.          

288
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,023
    the width of the lapping    

289
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,792
      determines the width      
         of the pillow.         

290
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,729
 the machine cuts the continuous
         web into pieces        

291
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,598
       and rolls each one       
  into what is called a "bat."  

292
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,267
     the length of the piece    

293
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,136
 determines the characteristics 
         of the pillow.         

294
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,738
  the longer the rolled piece,  

295
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,341
      the higher and firmer     
           the pillow.          

296
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,813
   an automated machine makes   
           the cotton           

297
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,484
 or cotton-blended pillowcases. 

298
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,953
   workers mount two identical  
         rolls of fabric        

299
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,356
   onto the machine's cradles   

300
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,892
    and feed the ends through   
  a series of tension rollers.  

301
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,894
   the two sheets must be taut  

302
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,031
    as they pass through the    
  machine's different stations. 

303
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:33,437
  first, blades trim the fabric 
  to the correct pillow size -- 

304
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,306
    standard, queen, or king.   

305
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,976
   then, a slitter runs across  
  each sheet, cutting a series  

306
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,345
     of rectangular pieces.     

307
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,717
    the machine then stitches   
     two rectangles together    

308
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,920
         on three sides.        

309
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:53,057
finally, the product information
        label is sewn on.       

310
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,601
  the machine uses an extremely 
     strong overlock stitch.    

311
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,207
       the pillow filling       
          is flattened          

312
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,009
        before it enters        
        the waiting case,       

313
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,445
    which is already covered    
      in retail packaging.      

314
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,493
    sewers close the open end   
          of the pillow         

315
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,029
 and trim off the excess fiber. 

316
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:36,233
    then the finished pillow    
  is placed in a shipping box.  

317
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,835
       for blown pillows,       

318
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:43,107
   an operator holds the open   
 end of the case over a nozzle. 

319
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,176
     then a machine blows in    
       a pre-set quantity       

320
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,312
        of loose fibers.        

321
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,648
      he weighs the pillow      

322
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,383
        then sends it to        
      the sewing department     

323
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,518
     to be stitched closed.     

324
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,921
     a blown pillow conforms    
 to your head when you lie down 

325
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,057
  and rebounds when you get up. 

326
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,127
         a garnet pillow        
        has less rebound.       

327
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,528
    not sure what to choose?    

328
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,631
          sleep on it.          

329
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,940
      narrator: if you have
