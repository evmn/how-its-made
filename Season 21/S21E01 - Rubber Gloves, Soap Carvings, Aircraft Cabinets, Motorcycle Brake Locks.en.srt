captions paid for by discovery communications

00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,587
narrator: it was an american nurse's   

4
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,523
that led to the development of medical rubber gloves.    

5
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,991
the year was 1890,        

6
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,994
and the hospital was johns hopkins in baltimore.           

7
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,196
sympathetic to the nurse's plight,      

8
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,866
the chief of surgery asked a rubber company         

9
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,201
to develop protective gloves.  

10
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,208
around the world, healing hands wear rubber gloves             

11
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,612
to stop the spread of germs and save lives.         

12
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:22,281
to make them, they need a lot of hands,    

13
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,217
the kind made from ceramic or aluminum.    

14
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,620
they'll serve as molds.     

15
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,958
first, they need to remove residue          

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,493
from the last rubber-glove production,     

17
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:38,064
so they do a thorough washing in soapy water...        

18
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,704
...and then in bleach.      

19
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,108
they must remove every speck of residue      

20
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,243
because even the smallest contaminate     

21
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,045
could lodge in the latex rubber gloves    

22
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,614
and create holes.        

23
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,516
leaving the bleach,       

24
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:02,254
the ceramic hands twirl     
into round, revolving brushes.  

25
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,790
their bristles scour the surface             

26
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,527
and the hard to reach areas between the ceramic fingers.   

27
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,266
after this thorough scrubbing,  

28
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,370
the hand molds dive into a tub of hot water.     

29
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,142
it's the last cleaning before production begins.    

30
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,077
as they exit the tub,      

31
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,281
the hands swivel on the rail carrier to drip dry.              

32
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,953
still slightly damp and spinning,          

33
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,889
the hand molds head into a chemical bath,      

34
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,024
which forms a film on the surface.         

35
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,425
it's a critical coating     

36
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,696
because liquid rubber won't adhere to bare ceramic,  

37
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:46,298
but it will to this substance.  

38
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,704
the ceramic molds now reach into warm, liquid rubber,    

39
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,440
which has been enhanced for extra strength.       

40
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,042
the liquid rubber        

41
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:58,777
reacts with the chemical coating on the hands           

42
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,413
and becomes gel-like.      

43
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,451
coated with the rubber gel,   

44
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,789
the hands spin to shake off any drops            

45
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,624
as they head into an oven.    

46
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,732
under intense heat, the rubber dries to the hand form.     

47
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,401
it also undergoes a chemical process        

48
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,803
called vulcanization       

49
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,505
that makes rubber stronger and elastic.           

50
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,208
after a wash and dry,      

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,946
the gloves spin through brushes which roll up the cuffs.     

52
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:38,217
this cuff roll, called the bead, has a specific purpose.     

53
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,587
it makes it easier to pull   
the rubber glove off the mold.  

54
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,895
workers grab the gloves by the beads           

55
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,764
to peel them off the ceramic forms.        

56
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,034
these particular medical gloves             

57
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,770
were molded from synthetic rubber      

58
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:00,239
for people who can't wear natural latex rubber       

59
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,174
due to allergies.        

60
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,043
these synthetic rubber gloves  

61
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,845
are a bit stickier than the natural latex ones,   

62
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,881
and they must be removed by hand.         

63
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:14,186
however, the natural latex gloves     

64
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,121
come off much more easily.    

65
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,257
bursts of pressurized air    

66
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,326
blow these gloves off the ceramic forms.      

67
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,595
at a test station,        

68
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,199
a worker now stretches and inflates each medical glove              

69
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,401
to check for weak spots and holes.    

70
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,838
even a pinhole leak would be cause for rejection.  

71
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,078
next, they take a sample glove from every batch         

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,215
and pump water into it, again checking for leaks.    

73
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,351
if the sample glove is watertight,          

74
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,053
they approve the entire batch for shipment.          

75
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,025
they color code gloves for strength.          

76
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:56,561
these orange cleaning gloves are thick and reusable.     

77
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:00,366
others, like the medical gloves, are for limited use       

78
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:02,367
and disposable.         

79
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:06,305
each rubber formulation is customized          

80
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:11,710
for color, strength, and other characteristics.    

81
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,914
it has taken a lot of fake hands and real ones   

82
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,181
to make rubber gloves,      

83
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,784
and it all happens very fast.  

84
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,521
they manufacture 200 rubber gloves a minute at this factory.            

85
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,190
that's about 12,000 gloves per hour.            

86
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,860
they pack them up in batches of 100.        

87
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,329
a cornstarch solution applied earlier         

88
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,498
keeps them from sticking together in the box.       

89
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,802
later, that starch will also act as a lubricant   

90
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,839
to allow the gloves to slide easily onto hands.   

91
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,609
and with all that,        

92
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:48,948
these rubber gloves are ready to protect the public.      

93
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,694
narrator: in northern thailand,            

94
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,631
the tradition of carving elaborate flowers from soap   

95
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,033
began in the 1930s with farm workers        

96
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,102
who were looking for a creative outlet.      

97
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:14,306
in their hands, pieces of soap became little works of art.   

98
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,376
and in the process,       
they carved out a niche market  

99
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,245
for soap flowers.        

100
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,383
today in thailand,        

101
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:28,119
there's a thriving tourist trade in floral soap carvings.     

102
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,258
these awesome blossoms are far too delicate for scrub-up duty.              

103
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,728
they're made to be admired.   

104
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,697
infused with fruit powders, they also add fragrance to a room.  

105
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,672
the carvers start by making their own soap.    

106
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:51,810
glycerin made of animal fats and oils is the main ingredient.           

107
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,079
other ingredients include fruit powder...         

108
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,548
water...             

109
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,084
food coloring -- in this case, yellow --     

110
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,019
fragrance...           

111
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,221
and vegetable oil.        

112
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,558
he mixes the vegetable oils with the water          

113
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,161
as he heats the ingredients slowly.     

114
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,697
he then adds the glycerin chunks       

115
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,966
to a separate bucket of hot water.          

116
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,035
the glycerin melts on contact,  

117
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,470
and he whisks it to disperse it in the water.   

118
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:26,978
he now pours the glycerin mixture in to the water and oil.              

119
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,382
using an electric mixer, he blends the ingredients,    

120
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,649
adding water as needed      

121
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,919
to achieve the desired consistency.     

122
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:38,324
he blends the mango fruit powder into the soap mixture.      

123
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,663
a dash of yellow coloring    

124
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,667
reflects the aroma of the soap -- mango.      

125
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,002
he adds a mango fragrance formulation  

126
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,472
to enhance the powdered fruit scent.    

127
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,277
that completes this aromatic liquid-soap mixture.  

128
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,883
he transfers it to a square pan lined with plastic.       

129
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,552
after a few hours,        

130
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,888
the soap solidifies into a big yellow bar.      

131
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,157
he pries the hardened soap    

132
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,493
and the plastic liner away from the pan        

133
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,095
and flips it over.        

134
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,764
the soap slab lands on the workbench.        

135
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,637
he peels the plastic liner off.              

136
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,040
now, using a device similar to a paper cutter,    

137
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,277
he slices the soap into long, uniform bars.     

138
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,217
he stacks them in piles of three.        

139
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,123
he cuts the stacks of long bars crosswise,            

140
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,392
producing small soap squares the size of brownies.      

141
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,062
each soap bar will be transformed       

142
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,131
into a beautiful flower.     

143
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:56,602
this takes artistic vision and skill.    

144
00:08:56,604 --> 00:09:00,339
the artist has many years of experience     

145
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:03,675
and carves with an expert hand.              

146
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,210
as he scoops out chunks,     

147
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,213
the broad and distinctive petals of an orchid take shape.     

148
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,352
he discards the broad base,   

149
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:18,657
and from a simple soap bar, a flower has bloomed.      

150
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,434
he dips the carving in water   

151
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:32,570
to improve the adhesion of water-based paint.      

152
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,774
he partially submerges the carving in paint,      

153
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,111
giving it a two-toned look.   

154
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,913
the artist selects color combinations        

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,582
for their visual impact,     

156
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,651
and authenticity is not essential.        

157
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:51,389
he brushes mauve paint onto the orchid's central column             

158
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,991
to accentuate it.        

159
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:57,396
he extends the brush strokes to the petals.          

160
00:09:57,398 --> 00:10:01,333
these brush strokes mimic the look of veins.        

161
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,735
with this colorful artistry,   

162
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,839
the soap carving seems to come to life.      

163
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,946
he dips a toothbrush in paint  

164
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,415
and flicks his thumb across the bristles       

165
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,051
to spray flecks onto the center column.     

166
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:27,159
with that final splash of color, the carving is complete.     

167
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,995
he glues it to the base of a decorative box.       

168
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,835
the box both protects the carving           

169
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,872
and adds to the presentation.  

170
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,644
taking the lid off reveals a surprise.       

171
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,248
the carving could be any flower in any color.          

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,116
but the most amazing thing of all              

173
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,686
is that it's been carved from soap.            

174
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,606
narrator: the world of private-passenger aircraft  

175
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,675
is all about comfort and luxury.             

176
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,077
big corporations send their top executives       

177
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,080
to travel in jets        
with well-appointed interiors.  

178
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,284
and the world's super-wealthy spare no expense         

179
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:29,054
making their private planes as lavish as their homes.    

180
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,826
just like building or renovating a house,      

181
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,095
you can choose all the decorative finishings  

182
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,429
of your new aircraft --     

183
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,767
everything from the       
floor covering and seat fabric  

184
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,303
to the style, wood type, and color of the cabinetry.   

185
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,440
it's critical not to weigh the aircraft down,              

186
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,610
so cabinets can't be made from particle board.       

187
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,782
even plywood is far too heavy.  

188
00:11:56,784 --> 00:12:01,053
the solution -- panels made of honeycomb-shaped hard paper   

189
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,655
sandwiched between fiberglass sheets,    

190
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:07,659
strong like particle board, but 1/4 the weight.       

191
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,663
computerized machines cut the panels to shape       

192
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,266
and drill holes for threaded inserts,      

193
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,401
into which bolts and screws for hinges and handles      

194
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,935
will fasten.           

195
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,939
after refining the holes with hand tools,         

196
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,809
workers hold the inserts in the holes with tape      

197
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,879
while they inject epoxy glue to bond the inserts permanently.          

198
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,416
the panels adjoin with a tongue and groove system,             

199
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,153
so computerized machines cut the edges accordingly.      

200
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,957
the material is fibrous, so the cut edges are rough.   

201
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,827
workers smooth them before gluing and assembling.  

202
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,633
certain panel surfaces are too 
hard to access after assembly,  

203
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,970
so they receive their decorative wood veneer facade        

204
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,839
before being cut to shape.    

205
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,045
these pieces are covered in a protective film       

206
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,048
to prevent damaging the veneer during assembly.         

207
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,319
once a unit is assembled,    
workers make sure it's square.  

208
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:10,188
they also verify the dimensions.           

209
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:17,128
meanwhile, an automated belt sander preps the veneer.  

210
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,664
veneer is wood that's been sliced into thin sheets.  

211
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,266
for these cabinet facades,    

212
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,069
these sheets are a mere 0.04 inches thick.  

213
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,571
the most typical choices     

214
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,607
are walnut, ebony, cherry, and birch.        

215
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,010
workers disassemble the unit   

216
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,414
to access each component for veneering.          

217
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,216
they lay the component on the back of the veneer sheet              

218
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,152
and trace it.          

219
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:44,823
then they follow the pencil line with a fine-tooth veneer saw.  

220
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,360
next, they spray contact cement on the component surface     

221
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,161
and the veneer's underside.   

222
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,164
a plastic sheet in between prevents contact         

223
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,034
until the veneer is correctly positioned.     

224
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,236
after pressing down the veneer,             

225
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,306
they place the component in a vacuum bag         

226
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,908
and suction out the air.     

227
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,445
this flattens the veneer evenly over the entire surface.     

228
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:10,182
eight hours later, the component comes out of the vacuum bag,   

229
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,852
and with a router, they trim the veneer flush all around.   

230
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,254
then they glue the edges with epoxy            

231
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:20,859
and apply strips of hardwood to match the facade.       

232
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,863
the epoxy cures in a couple of hours,      

233
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,131
at which point they sand the edges       

234
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,667
to remove any excess glue.    

235
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,538
now they reinstall the component            

236
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,273
and measure to make sure the surrounding gaps       

237
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,942
are precisely 0.06 inches.    

238
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,011
should some tweaking be required,           

239
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:44,382
they simply sand edges or adjust hinges.        

240
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,751
they disassemble yet again    

241
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:50,689
and touch up any imperfections 
that sanding the edges caused.  

242
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,627
once the touch-up paint is dry,              

243
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,830
they spray on the first of nine coats of lacquer.    

244
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,499
each coat has to dry overnight.           

245
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,637
they sand it twice       
before applying the next coat,  

246
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,173
first with an orbital sander,  

247
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,643
then with a sanding block    

248
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,912
to remove any waves in the lacquer          

249
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,113
left by the orbital sander.   

250
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,782
after the last coat of lacquer dries,        

251
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,520
they do a final sanding with a very fine grit paper.   

252
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:24,389
then, using a wool pad and polishing compound,     

253
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,427
they polish the surface to a reflective, high-gloss finish.             

254
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:40,137
workers now reassemble the components for the last time.  

255
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,607
they install the fixtures and accessories,  

256
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,877
the decorative hardware, and everything electrical.    

257
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,549
the cabinetry unit is finished.            

258
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,885
not only does the luxurious look              

259
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,155
fit a multi-million-dollar private aircraft,        

260
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,892
it's also, as they say in tech terms, plug and play.  

261
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,628
you just install        
and plug it into the aircraft,  

262
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:09,067
and everything runs --     
no additional wiring required.  

263
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,516
narrator: a motorcycle can be rolled into a truck or van    

264
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:25,984
and be gone in a minute,     

265
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,653
leaving an empty space and an angry owner.       

266
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,790
to help put the brakes on this parking-lot theft,    

267
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,526
there are portable locks for brakes.           

268
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,995
with the brakes in full lock down,        

269
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,697
the bike can't be rolled away.  

270
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,470
when it's time for a pit stop,  

271
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,872
a disc-brake lock takes some of the worry     

272
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:51,476
out of leaving         
a coveted motorbike unguarded.  

273
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,946
simply clip it onto the motorbike's brake rotor,   

274
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:59,684
turn the key, and the wheels won't budge.   

275
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,553
equipped with an alarm,     

276
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,222
this handy gadget can also alert bystanders    

277
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,358
of a crime in progress.     

278
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,631
before they manufacture the lock, they cut the keys.   

279
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,767
there are two for each lock.   

280
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,237
the employee inserts two blank key blades       

281
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,771
into milling machines      

282
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,241
that carve eight different notches into them.        

283
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,043
the combination of notches    

284
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,245
is one of over a million possible key codes.       

285
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,916
the machine prints the key-code information onto a card.     

286
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:36,588
in the meantime, the employee inserts the keys into a slot,  

287
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,591
and little brushes inside clean them.           

288
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:43,461
the assembler slips the matching keys onto a ring  

289
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:47,265
along with the key-code card to keep them all together.    

290
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,269
she installs batteries to power lights in the key grip.              

291
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:55,006
to make a lock to match the keys,        

292
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,208
the worker refers to the key-code card       

293
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,011
to select notched brass wafers.             

294
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,213
she stacks them in an assembly unit       

295
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,482
so that the notches in the wafers          

296
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:09,754
match the bits cut into the key blade.     

297
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,224
she places the lock cylinder above the wafers         

298
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,895
and activates a spring that lifts them into the cylinder.  

299
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,630
she flips the cylinder      

300
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:21,299
and removes it from the assembly device,    

301
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,702
then caps the cylinder, encasing the wafers.       

302
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,972
she tries a key and confirms it's a match.    

303
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,642
she brushes grease into two niches in the cylinder.            

304
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:35,179
she inserts locking bars into each one.          

305
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,714
the grease holds them in place  

306
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:40,051
as she slides a steel sleeve over the cylinder.        

307
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,988
she tries the key again to confirm the assembly functions.           

308
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,724
for extra protection,      

309
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,060
she encases the cylinder in a hard lock body.       

310
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,262
she plugs the open end      

311
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,065
and secures the metal plug with two pins.          

312
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,534
she now inserts bolts in the lock.           

313
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,203
in operation,          

314
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:02,140
these bolts will be pushed into the brake disc to lock it.               

315
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:07,212
a metal sliding cover protects the key hole when not in use.  

316
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,314
the installer adds a plastic mechanism       

317
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,616
to slide it open and closed more easily.           

318
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,824
they now have a completed lock bolt.      

319
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,626
they assemble the outer lock body.       

320
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,495
the two parts come together   

321
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,298
to form a slot to fit over the brake disc.   

322
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,969
using a custom measuring tool,  

323
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:34,371
the employee confirms that the hole for the lock mechanism            

324
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,373
is the correct size.       

325
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,778
she then slides an applicator for lubricant into that hole.  

326
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,382
it releases the lubricant, and she distributes it more evenly.             

327
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,254
she slots steel balls into compartments        

328
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,789
in the lock mechanism.      

329
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,858
when the lock is engaged,    

330
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,361
these balls will protrude and keep it engaged.       

331
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,801
she pops the locking bolt into the outer casing.      

332
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:07,471
she permanently secures it with a plastic spring,      

333
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:11,743
snapping it into place between 
the steel casing and the lock.  

334
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,345
another application of lubricant,          

335
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:18,650
and the motorcycle brake lock is ready for an alarm system.  

336
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,888
the alarm has been pre-assembled at another factory.       

337
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,891
it fits into a tray-like compartment of the casing.    

338
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,761
with the help of a mechanized tool,      

339
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,163
she press-fits the alarm to the casing.          

340
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,702
she slides a plastic dowel into the lock          

341
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:43,441
to confirm the alarm mechanism and gauges.             

342
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,511
she replaces the section of the casing    

343
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,580
that was removed for the alarm installation    

344
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,783
and secures it with a screw.   

345
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,924
she polishes the lock against a revolving wheel    

346
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,259
with little brushes.       

347
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,867
she rubs some oil on it, and the metal gleams.      

348
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:14,405
now complete, this motorbike brake-disc lock looks pretty,  

349
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,806
just don't mess with it.     

350
