00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:56,188
            narrator:           
  the deck of a railway bridge  

4
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:59,525
      is typically built of     
wood-timbers called bridge ties.

5
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,860
         they're bolted         
     to steel support beams     

6
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,565
    located on concrete piers   
 over the water or gully below. 

7
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,466
            the rails           
   on which the train travels   

8
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,335
 are bolted to the wooden ties. 

9
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,470
     wood absorbs the noise     
          and vibration         

10
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,039
      of the passing train.     

11
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,944
            the load            
  the railway bridge will carry 

12
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,212
determines the size of its ties.

13
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,880
     to calculate the load,     

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,616
       engineers factor in      
      the number of tracks,     

15
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:28,287
       volume of traffic,       
weight of the transported cargo,

16
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:32,091
     and whether the bridge     
     is straight or curved.     

17
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:36,028
   a curve will put additional  
    stress on the structure.    

18
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:40,499
    the wood of choice is oak   
  because it's hard and strong. 

19
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,468
          when the logs         
     arrive at the sawmill,     

20
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,237
     they come face-to-face     
 with a menacing-looking device 

21
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,073
       called a debarker.       

22
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:52,445
  a conveyor moves the shipment 
      toward the debarker,      

23
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:56,949
then drops a single log in front
  of it onto spinning rollers.  

24
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,787
   the rollers rotate the log,  

25
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,124
while the debarker makes its way
   from one end to the other.   

26
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:09,195
      it chews off the bark     
 with its sharp-toothed blades. 

27
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,933
    what the debarker shaves    
     off is put to good use.    

28
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,936
     the bark gets processed    
      into gardening mulch      

29
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,673
    and they burn the sawdust   
    in the wood-fired boiler    

30
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,842
     that runs another part     
          of the plant.         

31
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,947
     next, one log at a time    
  drops into a mobile carriage  

32
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,017
          that runs it          
     through a circular saw.    

33
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,351
    the carriage has sensors    

34
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,621
          which detect          
      the log's extremities     

35
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,022
    and report its dimensions   

36
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:40,559
      to a console located      
     in the operator's cab.     

37
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:43,028
          the operator          
      interprets the data.      

38
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,763
  using a joystick controller,  

39
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,032
        he flips the log        
     into whichever position    

40
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,968
      maximizes the yield.      

41
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,705
       the first few runs       

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,508
   trim off the rough surface   
      and square the shape.     

43
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,444
    the next runs cut boards,   

44
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,313
        which the sawmill       
    sells to flooring plants.   

45
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:04,516
  this continues until the log  
     is the exact dimensions    

46
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,052
       of the bridge tie.       

47
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,588
    again, nothing is wasted.   

48
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,925
      the sawmill processes     
  the cutoffs into wood chips,  

49
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,861
which it then sells to companies
    that make particle board,   

50
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,732
    strand board, and similar   
     construction materials.    

51
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,469
   the sawmill stacks the ties  

52
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,005
          for transfer          
  to the bridge mill next door. 

53
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:29,408
   the role of the bridge mill  
     is to frame the bridge,    

54
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,744
     also known as dapping.     

55
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:34,813
       that's the process       
  of making the specific holes  

56
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,415
     and notches in each tie    

57
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:40,019
  for attaching it to the steel 
   beam on which it will sit.   

58
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,089
       at the bridge mill,      

59
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,293
  the bridge layout supervisor  
  processes one tie at a time.  

60
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,096
      he carefully reviews      
   the engineer's blueprints,   

61
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,865
      which assign a number     
     to each and every tie.     

62
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:58,370
 these numbers specify precisely
where the saw has to cut notches

63
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:01,306
       and where the drill      
       has to bore holes.       

64
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,509
 the locations of these notches 
         and holes vary,        

65
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,044
 depending on the tie's position
         on the bridge.         

66
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,448
       so, he must follow       
  the blueprints meticulously.  

67
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,853
         after measuring        
     and marking it all out,    

68
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,523
he sends the tie to the dap saw.

69
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,325
 the operator sets up each cut, 

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,260
       lining up the mark       
       with laser-lights,       

71
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,461
   which indicate the location  
      and the cutting depth     

72
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,930
          of the blade.         

73
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:42,080
 the notches are just the right 
 size to fit over the steel beam

74
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,216
   on which the tie will lie.   

75
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,420
              next,             
  a worker using a drill press  

76
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,223
   bores holes for hook bolts,  
    which go through the tie    

77
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,893
          to secure it          
      onto the steel beams.     

78
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,164
    each tie receives a metal   
       identification tag,      

79
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:03,569
    which includes the bridge   
        and tie numbers.        

80
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,571
          on each end,          
  workers nail on a mesh plate, 

81
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,575
       made of rust-proof       
        galvanized steel.       

82
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,511
  the plate has teeth designed  
   to grasp and hold together   

83
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:16,381
    the wood fiber to prevent   
     the end from splitting.    

84
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,718
    after nailing the id tag    
    to one of the end plates,   

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,088
  workers force in both plates  
          with a press.         

86
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:31,730
       the tie's last stop      
is the adjacent treatment plant.

87
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,667
       they spend 24 hours      
   inside a high-temperature,   

88
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,068
      high-pressure chamber     

89
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,939
      which penetrates them     
with a creosote-borate solution.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,075
     this protects the wood     
   from rot and insect damage   

91
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,010
 and extends the tie's life-span

92
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:49,515
       from about a decade      
      to at least 25 years.     

93
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,498
            narrator:           
     when filtering liquids,    

94
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,300
 it's all about thinking small. 

95
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:12,238
  membrane filters can separate 
 the tiniest solids from fluids,

96
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:15,840
   which purifies the liquids   
    and recovers the solids.    

97
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,110
         once separated,        
       the two substances       

98
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:22,414
       may then be reused       
 so that nothing goes to waste. 

99
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:31,724
 membrane filters can turn murky
 water clear, almost magically. 

100
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:37,329
  to demonstrate, a technician  
installs a spiral-wound membrane

101
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,531
         in the housing         
      of a pumping system,      

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,933
 which is a small-scale version 

103
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,603
      of what you would see     
          in a factory.         

104
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,474
      she turns on the tap,     
  and water flows into a tank.  

105
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:52,177
      she adds latex paint      
  to purposely sully the water. 

106
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,749
        the system pumps        
     the contaminated water     

107
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,150
       through a strainer       

108
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:03,422
  and then the membrane filter  
 while meters measure the flow. 

109
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,091
    within minutes, the paint   
     has been filtered out,     

110
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,293
     and the water is clear.    

111
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,199
 the making of a membrane filter
 begins with polypropylene mesh.

112
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:21,907
   an automated system unwinds  
 the mesh and cuts it to length.

113
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,544
        these mesh sheets       
    will be used as spacers.    

114
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,847
       they'll create gaps      
         for the liquid         

115
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,017
   to flow through the filter   
     and over the membrane.     

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,321
        next, the system        
cuts sheets of polyester fabric.

117
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:37,790
    these will form channels    

118
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,792
   through which the filtered   
      material will travel.     

119
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,663
     these sheets are known     
      as permeate spacers.      

120
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:48,600
       an employee stacks       
  the polyester fabric sheets.  

121
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,936
      using high-frequency      
          sound waves,          

122
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,640
 she welds one sheet to the next
        at just one end.        

123
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:01,146
      she layers and welds      
      a total of 15 sheets,     

124
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,215
        and then applies        
       double-sided tape.       

125
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,352
    the tape is for attaching   
  the packet to a central tube, 

126
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:10,356
    and it will also serve as   
 a guide to correctly align it. 

127
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,429
     next, the membrane soup    
    flows into a long trough.   

128
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:21,767
           it's a mix           
of melted plastics and solvents.

129
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,836
      paper backing unwinds     
         into the trough        

130
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,640
   and is coated with the soup  
          on one side.          

131
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,777
  the coated paper then travels 
    through two quench tanks,   

132
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,312
   and the plastic components   
            solidify            

133
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,715
 as the solvents are drawn out. 

134
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,717
      the exiting solvents      
 create a unique core structure 

135
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:42,988
        in the remaining        
     white plastic membrane.    

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,591
        the membrane now        
     travels by a light box,    

137
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,060
        which illuminates       
       any visual defects.      

138
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:53,565
   an applicator also drips a   
 preservative onto the membrane.

139
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,302
   a team unrolls the membrane  
       onto a work table.       

140
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,074
        they lay a sheet        
   of the polypropylene mesh,   

141
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:05,778
    which we saw cut to size    
    earlier, on the membrane.   

142
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,883
          the employee          
     then cuts the membrane     

143
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,552
to twice the length of the mesh.

144
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,487
     they fold the membrane     
         over the mesh,         

145
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,890
  creating a membrane envelope. 

146
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,024
  the mesh serves as a pathway  
            for fluid           

147
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,628
 to flow between the membranes. 

148
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,199
    meanwhile, another worker   

149
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:30,836
          applies epoxy         
   to perforated plastic tube.  

150
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,171
           he attaches          
   the permeate spacers to it   

151
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,773
   with the double-sided tape,  

152
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,677
  giving the epoxy time to cure 
      for a permanent seal.     

153
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,781
       he and a colleague       
        apply more epoxy        

154
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,085
        to the perimeter        
      of the bottom sheet.      

155
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:48,053
          they transfer         
   the membrane envelope to it  

156
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,921
     and continue to layer,     

157
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,058
    making a permeate fabric    
     and membrane sandwich.     

158
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,064
      the worker then winds     
    the glued layers snuggly    

159
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,132
  to a perforated plastic core, 

160
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,902
             forming            
   the spiral membrane filter.  

161
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,341
 he tapes the multi-layered wad 
   from one end to the other.   

162
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,543
    the tape holds everything   
        tightly in place        

163
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,246
  as the epoxy cures overnight. 

164
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,082
       they leave the tape      
       on after the cure,       

165
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,886
       and a machine winds      
 epoxy-drenched fiberglass rope 

166
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,021
    around the entire filter.   

167
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,158
       as the epoxy cures,      

168
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,762
 the rope will form a hard shell
   around the membrane filter.  

169
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,231
        partway through,        

170
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,867
      they apply the label      
      with a company name.      

171
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:43,575
 the operator captures the glue 
     runoff during the wind.    

172
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,578
        and it's a wrap,        
      so he cuts the rope.      

173
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,715
         from the side,         
  you can see the flow channels 

174
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,784
       between the layers.      

175
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,588
 concentrated contaminants will 
  travel through them and out.  

176
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,124
  the filtered liquid will seep 
     into the core and exit,    

177
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,361
        clearly improved.       

178
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,743
     narrator: the invention    
  of the hydraulic post driver  

179
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,411
          in the 1960s          

180
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,348
     allowed workers to drop    
 their shovels and sledgehammers

181
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:26,485
  and let a machine do the job  
of pounding fence and sign posts

182
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,885
        into the ground.        

183
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,488
          when it comes         
   to labor-saving inventions,  

184
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:33,892
     this one is definitely     
       a striking example.      

185
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,364
         the post driver        

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,034
       raises hefty fence       
  or sign posts into position,  

187
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,471
       and then slams them      
        into the ground.        

188
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,512
     inside a vertical case,    
       a hydraulic system       

189
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,314
    drops a 300-pound weight    
       to drive the post,       

190
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,317
        and then lifts it       
        for another hit.        

191
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,390
   this machine does the work   
  of two or more brawny humans  

192
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:09,394
      with just one person      
        at the controls.        

193
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,864
   to make it, they start with  
 a vertical case for the weight.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,866
  a high-precision plasma torch 

195
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,268
           cuts steel           
    into a rectangular shape    

196
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,738
 and makes holes for components.

197
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:25,076
    they insert the rectangle   
  into a break-press repeatedly 

198
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,479
           to bend it           
    into a three-sided part.    

199
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,614
  the profile includes flanges  

200
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:33,185
         for welding it         
  to the back wall of the case. 

201
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,089
        he fits the part        
        to the back wall        

202
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:41,026
    and welds them together,    
completing the post driver case.

203
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,899
       an employee builds       
     the post driver weight     

204
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,002
 working within a weld fixture. 

205
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,008
    it's a box-shaped weight,   
  and he welds it at the seams. 

206
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,978
       he taps the corners      
        between the welds       

207
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,947
           to maintain          
     a tight configuration.     

208
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:08,053
 this 300-pound weight can later
    be filled with steel shot   

209
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:12,190
     to make it even heavier    
       for greater impact.      

210
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,393
    the next worker assembles   
   yellow steel jaws to a hub   

211
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,462
     to produce the grapple.    

212
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,399
        this is the part        
    that grips the fence post   

213
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,434
  and raises it into position.  

214
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,539
    he sticks a danger label    
          onto the hub          

215
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,310
  to warn people to stay clear  
     of these powerful jaws.    

216
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,280
           he attaches          
      a hydraulic cylinder,     

217
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,617
         which will make        
    the jaws open and close.    

218
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:43,455
    he connects the cylinder    
       to the grapple jaw.      

219
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,892
              next,             
 they move on to the metal plate

220
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,896
   that will be used to mount   
  the post driver to a vehicle, 

221
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,698
    like a skid-steer loader.   

222
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,700
           it includes          
      a hydraulic mechanism     

223
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:58,470
   for tilting the fence post   
         left or right.         

224
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,110
 the employee installs a control
   valve next to the cylinder   

225
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,646
  and links the two with hoses. 

226
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,048
 he'll also connect the grapple 

227
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,718
      and weight hydraulics     
         to this valve.         

228
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,661
  back to the post driver case  
    now -- it's been painted,   

229
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,264
  and they're ready to install  
      the hydraulic motor.      

230
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,934
     the worker connects it     
   to the sprockets and chains  

231
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,135
   that will lift the weight.   

232
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,871
he pins the sprockets into place

233
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,842
  and installs tensioning rods  
         on either side.        

234
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,947
       next, a cover plate      
     protects the sprockets.    

235
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,017
       the tensioning rods      
      protrude through it.      

236
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,888
        he slides springs       
   onto those tensioning rods   

237
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,059
   and compresses the springs   
    to maintain the tension.    

238
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,966
   he now attaches the grapple  
    to the post driver case.    

239
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,937
     he locks it into place     
        with a long pin.        

240
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,111
 he links the grapple hydraulics
      to the control valve.     

241
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,380
     and it's ready to grab     
         big fence posts        

242
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,784
       and hold on tight.       

243
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:27,125
 they attach the metal mounting 
 plate to the post driver case. 

244
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,794
    the work table tilts back   
     to move the post driver    

245
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,130
    into an upright position.   

246
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,467
    with the help of a crane,   

247
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,336
         the next worker        
 moves the weight into position 

248
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,806
  and lowers it into the case.  

249
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,081
he slides a pin into the top end

250
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,883
       to keep the weight       
        from falling out        

251
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,486
      when the post driver      
         is on an angle.        

252
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,226
     one day in the making,     

253
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:05,697
  this hydraulic post driver is 
 ready for years of heavy labor,

254
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:11,002
 taking over for humans so they 
  don't have to move a muscle.  

255
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,719
       narrator: a biplane      
   is a vintage-style aircraft  

256
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,790
     with two pairs of wings    
  sitting one above the other.  

257
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:35,126
   the top wings are typically  
    raised above the fuselage   

258
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,330
  with vertical struts bracing  
    them to the bottom wings.   

259
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,265
dating back to the earliest days
          of aviation,          

260
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:45,070
      they're still popular     
   for performing aerobatics.   

261
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,473
     a biplane's lower wings    
         have ailerons,         

262
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,943
     which bank the airplane    
      to the right or left.     

263
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,144
      on the plane's tail,      

264
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,348
elevators pitch the plane's nose
           up or down           

265
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,217
    while a rudder steers it    
         left or right.         

266
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:02,554
           a propeller          
    provides the propulsion.    

267
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,757
    the plane has four wings.   

268
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,892
    each wing has two spars,    

269
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,028
          wooden beams          
     at the front and rear,     

270
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,096
           which form           
    the perimeter structure.    

271
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:16,968
 a craftsman skillfully fashions
these spars out of sitka spruce.

272
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,505
 this wood is exceedingly light,
    yet exceptionally strong,   

273
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,374
          making it one         
       of only a few woods      

274
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,578
   approved for structural use  
          in airplanes.         

275
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,046
      after sawing the wood     
      to the spar's shape,      

276
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,050
   he mounts attachment plates  
      made of sitka spruce      

277
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,985
      and mahogany plywood.     

278
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,520
    these are the end struts,   

279
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,922
       steel vertical bars      
  which will connect the upper  

280
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,125
        and lower wings.        

281
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,528
      he finishes the spar      
    by refining its contour,    

282
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,265
    first with a hand plane,    
     then an electric plane.    

283
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,402
  using strips of sitka spruce, 

284
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,472
he constructs 15 structural ribs
         for each wing.         

285
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,474
   he begins with long strips,  

286
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,345
which have been soaking in water
for a week to make them pliable.

287
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,081
       he inserts one end       
      into a curved fixture     

288
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,017
  and leaves the strips to dry. 

289
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,620
  when he removes them a couple 
         of days later,         

290
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,089
      they have a permanent     
       aerodynamic curve.       

291
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,224
            he glues            
   two curved strips together   

292
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,093
      to form the perimeter     
           of one rib.          

293
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:20,432
   in between, he glues short   
 diagonal strips called trusses.

294
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,435
    he reinforces both sides    
      of each intersection      

295
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,305
    with a rectangular piece    
        called a gusset.        

296
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,640
 an assembler mounts the 15 ribs
            crosswise           

297
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,110
      on the front and rear     
           wing spars,          

298
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:37,048
  then installs three aluminum  
 tubes called compression ribs. 

299
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,717
      these absorb air load     
       hitting the spars,       

300
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,188
     keeping the wooden ribs    
  from flexing under pressure.  

301
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,323
          the craftsman         
  connects the compression ribs 

302
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,726
 with criss-crossing metal rods.

303
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:54,365
    after applying more glue    
       to critical areas,       

304
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,000
    he nails an aluminum trim   

305
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,537
       over the front spar      
      and nose of the ribs.     

306
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,939
this is called the leading edge.

307
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,276
 it's the first part of the wing
        to hit the wind,        

308
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,512
      so it takes the brunt     
        of the air load.        

309
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,418
 finally, he laces reinforcement
      tape through the ribs     

310
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,887
        in an x pattern.        

311
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:19,557
   the completed structure now  
moves to the covering department

312
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,025
   where technicians drape it   

313
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,028
       in heat shrinkable       
        polyester fabric.       

314
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,565
  they cut the fabric to size,  
 glue it to the wing perimeter, 

315
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,234
      and heat the surface      
          with an iron          

316
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:31,903
      to shrink the fabric      
        until it's taut.        

317
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,907
then, they stitch over the glued
   areas with polyester cord.   

318
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,976
    they brush on a chemical    
      which seals the pores     

319
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,644
         of the fabric.         

320
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,513
     this primes the surface    
     to receive a spray coat    

321
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,115
     of polyurethane paint,     

322
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,786
 which is a special formulation 
  designed for aircraft bodies. 

323
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,657
      technicians construct     
       the fuselage frame       

324
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,327
      out of high-strength      
       steel alloy tubes.       

325
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,931
  they use an electric torch to 
 slightly melt adjoining pieces 

326
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:02,534
   so they fuse to each other.  

327
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,603
 because there's no filler metal
       bonding the pieces,      

328
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,440
 the welds don't add any weight 
        to the structure.       

329
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,677
    after painting the frame,   

330
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,748
  technicians install aluminum  
   floor panels and bulkheads.  

331
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,150
      in the tail, they add     
    lighter weight bulkheads    

332
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,354
    made of mahogany plywood    
        and sitka spruce.       

333
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,956
         then it's time         
       to bolt the engine       

334
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,692
          to the front          
     of the fuselage frame.     

335
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,433
  the engine drives a propeller 

336
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:39,170
 made of either wood, aluminum, 
    or a composite material.    

337
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,907
  painted aluminum body panels  
        cover the frame.        

338
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,576
           technicians          
      install the fuel tank     

339
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,979
    between the front cockpit   
         and the engine.        

340
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:51,516
    then they bolt the wings    
        to the fuselage.        

341
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,052
      vertical steel struts     
      connect and reinforce     

342
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,987
     the two levels of wings    

343
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,923
   bolting to those attachment  
    plates on the wing spars.   

344
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:04,395
     next, technicians mount    
 the painted aluminum ailerons, 

345
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,598
            the tail,           
  with its elevators and rudder 

346
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,200
     made of painted fabric     
       over welded steel,       

347
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,135
   and then the engine cover.   

348
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,404
    they install a windscreen   

349
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,807
      and instrument panel      
        for each cockpit.       

350
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,611
the front screen can be replaced
      with a cockpit cover      

351
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,515
     to keep the pilots warm    
  when flying in cold weather.
