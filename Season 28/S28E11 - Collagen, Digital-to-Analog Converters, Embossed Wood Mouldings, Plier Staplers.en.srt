narrator: abalone is an edible mollusk. 

4
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,390
its shell has         
a multicolored iridescent lining

5
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,326
that's been used since ancient times      

6
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,295
to decorate jewelry and other prized objects.   

7
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,630
more recently, abalone has been tapped    

8
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,165
as a source of collagen,    

9
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,935
a protein that supports the structure of bones,    

10
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:13,439
connective tissues, and skin. 

11
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:17,142
abalone collagen is a popular treatment in asia.  

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:20,112
this farm and factory raises the abalones,      

13
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:23,214
then extracts their collagen to add to drinks,       

14
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,552
cosmetics, and medicine.    

15
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,621
the abalones spend their first six months     

16
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,657
in the farm's hatchery and nursery pond.       

17
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,793
nocturnal, they hide      
from daylight under cement tiles

18
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,895
that simulate their natural habitat     

19
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,765
of rocks and coral.      

20
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,634
their single shell has pores  

21
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,668
that regulate various bodily functions        

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,473
such as breathing and reproduction.       

23
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,442
the main ingredient in their specially formulated food

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,778
is seaweed.          

25
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,314
feeding time is once every evening.

♪♪         

27
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,384
at six months of age,     

28
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:03,121
the abalones graduate to the cultivation pond.    

29
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,191
there are two types of growing methods.      

30
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,227
in this one, before filling the pond with seawater,    

31
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,930
workers lay cement tiles at the bottom,         

32
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,900
along with underwater pipes that supply oxygen,      

33
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,369
which abalones need to survive.

34
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,841
the other method houses the abalones      

35
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,176
in stacks of polyethylene crates,    

36
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,213
referred to as condominiums.  

37
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,684
with 50 to 100 abalones in each condo,         

38
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:34,553
the yield per square foot is significantly greater.   

39
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,325
every second day, workers remove the condos   

40
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:42,528
from the cultivation pond to rinse out the crates,    

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,564
check the abalones, and feed them.         

42
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,300
rather than wastefully using new seawater,      

43
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,769
the pond water is regularly drained,     

44
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,238
cleaned, and recirculated.   

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,507
the cleaning system filters out feces       

46
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,610
and neutralizes ammonia.    

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,514
after six months to a year in the cultivation pond,    

48
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,819
the abalones are mature and ready for harvesting.   

49
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,853
workers remove them from the shell         

50
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,857
and remove organs to be used for other products.      

51
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,493
then, the workers prepare to extract collagen      

52
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,594
from the meat.         

53
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:21,233
first, they mash the meat in an industrial-sized blender.

54
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,669
the trick is to use an extraction method      

55
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,571
that doesn't destroy the collagen      

56
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:28,907
or diminish its effectiveness. 

57
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,477
abalone collagen must have full potency when consumed   

58
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,413
in order to stimulate the human body         

59
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:38,050
to produce more of its own collagen.      

60
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,453
since prolonged heating turns collagen into gelatin,  

61
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,823
worker use a process called cold extraction,    

62
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,892
stirring the meat in refrigerated tanks     

63
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,494
for up to seven days      

64
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,429
until the collagen separates  

65
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,898
and rises to the top.     

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
workers skim off the collagen, 

67
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,368
then, to make this particular product,    

68
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,706
blend it with mixed fruit juices.    

69
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,208
then they heat the drink in pasteurization tanks    

70
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,446
for three minutes to kill off any bacteria.   

71
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,748
the drink contains 20% collagen

72
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,451
and 80% juice.         

73
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,521
when it's time to package the product,    

74
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,622
the conveyor belt moves glass bottles      

75
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,291
to the cleaning station,    

76
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,928
which washes them out with pressurized boiling water.

77
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,638
after washing, the bottles move to the next machine    

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
which fills them with the drink.

79
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,245
the next machine seals the bottles       

80
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,081
with an aluminum twist cap.  

81
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,823
controlled by a sensor,    

82
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:54,359
an inkjet printer applies the lot number on the cap   

83
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,361
along with the product's expiration date,        

84
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,330
a year away.          

85
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,233
a worker visually inspects the bottles      

86
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:05,170
as they make their way to the labeling machine.    

87
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,906
the factory's on-site laboratory
conducts a series       

88
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:12,644
of quality control tests on random samples.       

89
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,646
in this test, the technician uses      

90
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,749
a ph meter to ensure the product's acidity     

91
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,219
is within a specific target range.         

92
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,023
in another test, she places a few drops     

93
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,826
on a device called a refractometer.    

94
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,994
it measures to what extent   

95
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,362
light passing through the liquid is bent,      

96
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,699
which gives a reading of the sweetness.       

97
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,103
while this drink is a skin enhancement product,

are designed for weight loss, boosting immunity,

100
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,914
increasing bone density, and strengthening cartilage.

then bake the paint in an oven to make it more durable.    

130
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,776
then they print labeling on the chassis's front

workers solder the l.e.d. board
to the front panel circuit board

151
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,451
which runs the converter's user controls.

155
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,905
this aligns the push buttons with the corresponding contacts

156
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,274
on the board.         

157
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,013
the worker assembles the chassis bottom,

they attach the front panel with its push button controls, 

160
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,061
and in the center, an opening for the cd drive.  

161
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,233
the technician visually inspects

162
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,735
the converter's main circuit board,      

163
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,605
which converts the digital signal to analog. 

164
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,644
if the main circuit board passes inspection,       

165
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,013
they install it in the back of the converter  

166
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,082
next to the power supply board.

167
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,655
next, a worker installs the cd drive.     

168
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,791
this requires connecting three cables    

169
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,793
into the main board --     

170

one for the optical reader,  

171
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:59,764
and two for the motors that open
and close the loading tray   

172
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,933
and spin the compact disc.   

173
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,172
before completing the converter
by closing up the top,     

174
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,474
a worker tests the cd drive  

175
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,610
as well as the four other digital inputs,     

176
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,778
which are designed for connecting devices     

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,647
such as audio components,   

178

dvd or blu-ray players,    

179
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:21,519
tvs, and computers.      

180
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,155
the testing machine takes all kinds of measurements   

181
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,057
to ensure the converter performs

182
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,895
to a list of technical specifications.        

183
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,830
if the unit passes inspection, 

184
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:36,034
they complete the assembly by attaching the top cover.  

185

this digital-to-analog converter

186
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,038
is now ready to play its critical role       

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,275
in this high-end audio system,

can make factory furniture look handcrafted.       

191
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,034
the technique was developed over a century ago       

192
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,570
to mimic carvings on fancier furnishings     

193
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:14,105
that were only available to the wealthy.        

194
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,209
today, this trim is still giving furniture and cabinetry

the look of hand carving.   

196
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,951
the purpose of embossed wood trim     

197
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,885
is purely aesthetic.      

198
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,054
it can transform a piece of furniture

and make it a beautiful thing. 

200
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,096
making embossed moulding starts
with a rough piece of maple.

00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,363
using a rip saw,        

202
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,834
a woodworker slices the board into strips.     

203
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,169
the first cut straightens   

204
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,672
the edge of the wood to correct warps,       

205
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,473
and the second one trims the strips        

206
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,976
to the correct dimension.

209
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:59,484
to get two pieces of trim from one board.        

210

a machine that shapes the flat surface to a specific profile. 

213
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,732
the moulder has five cutter heads.       

214
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,068
to prepare them, he inserts a spacer

the worker secures it with a nut,          

221

that's to be embossed

the oldest wheels are made of bronze,      

235

and the newer ones are made of steel.       

236
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,986
there are hundreds of patterns to choose from.        

237
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:46,991
the worker selects the wheel with the desired pattern.   

238
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,094
he mounts it to an embossing machine    

239
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,229
that was built in 1908.    

240
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,368
the worker locks the embossing wheel onto the shaft.     

241
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,239
he ignites torches that heat the embossing wheel. 

242
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,174
as the hot wheel revolves,   

243
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,645
it presses the pattern into the moulded strip of wood.

244
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:08,980
the heat releases moisture from the wood,         

245
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,583
preventing splintering during embossing.       

246
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,686
a drive wheel below works in concert        

247
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,956
with the embossing wheel to move the wood forward.   

248
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,894
next up are rosettes      

249
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,663
that are used to accentuate the corners of furniture,   

250
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,733
windows, and doors.      

251
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,003
using a sliding apparatus known as a sled,        

252
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,541
the woodworker delivers a board
to the teeth of a saw.     

253
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,476
he makes straight cuts and squares          

254
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,879
to the desired dimensions.   

255
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,281
the worker draws lines from one corner        

256
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,050
of the wood square to another, 

257
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,987
and from the opposite sides.  

258
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,625
the lines intersect at the exact center of the square.  

259
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,030
the worker clamps the square in a milling machine      

260
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:03,134
with the cutting tool aimed directly at the center.    

261
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:07,672
he activates the tool to make the first circular cut.    

262
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,775
he removes the wood square to check out the cut.     

263
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,879
the worker measures it to confirm           

264
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,048
that it is in fact, dead center.

265
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,318
he returns the square to the platform        

266
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,287
under the milling tool.    

267
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,423
this time the cutter spins into the wood         

268
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,193
to make a wider and deeper circular cut.    

269
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,630
this further expands the pattern
in a radial fashion.      

270
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:41,306
and it completes the rosette pattern.      

271
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,908
the worker examines the quality of the cut     

272
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,277
and measures the distance to the edge of the wood    

273
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,146
to verify that it's to spec.  

274
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,685
from a simple wood square to an elegant rosette,     

275
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,087
this job is done.

00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,458
these particular parts are pusher guides.       

307
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,894
the top part has the protective coating.    

308
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,296
the parts then take a ride   

309
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,466
with ceramic stones and polishing solution.    

310
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:52,636
this smoothes rough bits and makes them shine.     

311
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,606
next up is the die plate.   

312
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,140
this is the part that shapes  

313
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:59,910
and closes the staple during stapling.        

314
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,047
an automated system screws an iron "u"-bolt attachment  

315
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,282
to the die plate.       

316
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,453
a robot then inserts the spring block,       

317
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,222
the part that allows the stapler

318
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:15,893
to spring back to its original position after use.  

319
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,962
meanwhile at the next station, 

320
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,764
a robot places a piece of precision-cut steel 

321
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,167
on a mold.           

322
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,069
a press drives it into the mold

323
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,204
to shape it into the stapler body     

324
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,474
that holds all the working components.    

325
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,112
more robots then work in perfect sequence,      

326
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,582
to install thick metal pins across the stapler body.    

327
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,621
these pins brace the stapler's structure,    

328
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,123
but that's not all.      

329
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,957
some of the stapler's working parts         

330
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,127
will hook onto these pins.   

331
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,931
other robots now fasten the die plate      

332
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,335
to one end of the stapler body using rivet hinge.    

333
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,405
in the process, they also fasten        

334
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,142
the spring block securely to the die plate.   

335
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,751
after cleaning and degreasing, 

336
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,288
the stapler bodies head into a paint booth.    

337
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,290
spray guns apply primer,    

338
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,360
and a curtain of water behind the parts prevents emissions  

339
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,095
from escaping from the booth. 

340
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,200
the next sprayers coat the parts with green paint.  

341
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,939
with the paint dry on the stapler body,      

342
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:39,610
workers are ready to assemble all the working parts.     

343
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:43,514
the assembler slides the front staple track into place    

344
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,652
and inserts the staple pusher guide into the body.      

345
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,387
she positions a metal plate over the guide         

346
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,023
and screws everything in place 

347
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,359
through holes in the body of the stapler.  

348
00:19:55,361 --> 00:20:00,631
the assembler clips a retaining
ring around each screw.    

349
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,567
next up is the driver.     

350
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,168
this part detaches staples   

351
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,038
one at a time during stapling. 

352
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,340
after installing it, the assembler inserts     

353
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,909
the spring loaded pusher    

354
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,680
and hooks the end on the staple guide.      

355
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,548
another worker assembles the handle           

356
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,083
that allows the stapler    

357
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:23,421
to be wielded with plier-like accuracy.   

358
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,790
he secures the handle with a rolling fastener.    

359
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,027
this rolling fastener indirectly bears down     

360
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,463
on the staples to apply pressure during stapling.   

361
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,536
another team member then inspects the stapler.   

362
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,006
satisfied with its fabrication,

363
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,608
she reaches for the cover plate

364
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,912
and hammers the wings to bend them for a better fit. 

365
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,881
she slides the cover plate into the grooves of the stapler

366
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,918
and loads the staples to give it a trial run.    

367
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,224
she staples paper repeatedly to confirm     

368
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,861
that it's fully operational.  

369
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:07,732
these plier staplers      
are now ready for the workplace,

370
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,766
where with a few quick crunches,

371
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,637
they'll help keep the paperwork in order.
