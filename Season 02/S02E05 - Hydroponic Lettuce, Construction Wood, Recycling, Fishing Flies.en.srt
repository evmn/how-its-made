00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:27,492
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

4
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,428
hydroponic lettuce,

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,096
construction wood,

6
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,297
recycling,

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,233
and fishing flies.

8
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,372
bet you thought the only way to grow lettuce

9
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,241
was in a garden.

10
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,910
well, vegetables don't necessarily need soil.

11
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,578
they can also grow in water,

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,049
provided it contains the proper
nutrients and fertilizers.

13
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,484
that's called hydroponics.

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,324
this method of growing hydroponic lettuce

15
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,327
is called "deep pool floating raft technology."

16
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,131
it sounds pretty complicated, but it's really quite simple,

17
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,466
and it all starts in the germination area

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,634
with lettuce seeds.

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,737
to plant them, workers use a steel tray

20
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,673
connected to a vacuum hose.

21
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,875
the tray has 276 holes,

22
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:20,812
and a vacuum sucks a seed into each one.

23
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:25,083
next they take a foam block with corresponding holes

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,154
called an oasis and position it into the tray.

25
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,892
a quick flip deposits a seed into each hole of the oasis.

26
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,694
the seeds are coated in clay.

27
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,564
clay holds in moisture to nourish the seed

28
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:42,101
but also breaks apart easily to let the seed sprout.

29
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,578
on the way to the greenhouse,

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,582
the seeds get their first watering.

31
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,650
then workers set them afloat.

32
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:02,421
the pool of water is about 12 inches deep.

33
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,594
technicians continuously monitor
and manipulate

34
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,196
its levels of oxygen and fertilizer.

35
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,798
that's the key to hydroponic growing.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,801
the water is never discarded, just topped off

37
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,272
to replace what the plants drink
and what evaporates.

38
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,613
on the first day, they water the seeds frequently.

39
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,816
within a couple of days, the seedlings start to appear.

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,620
they water and fertilize them.

41
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,289
by about the fourth day,

42
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,225
there's some significant sprouting action.

43
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:44,029
again, they water and fertilize the plants.

44
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,899
the first leaves emerge on about
the seventh day in the summer,

45
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,369
on about the 11th day in the winter.

46
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,905
the winter growth rate is slower
because there's less sun.

47
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,307
at this point,

48
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:59,244
it's time for the first in a series of transplants.

49
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:04,049
workers transfer the lettuces from the 276-plant oasis

50
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:09,454
to a styrofoam board that holds more plants -- 288.

51
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,058
they set the boards afloat in the nursery zone.

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,928
at about the 13-day mark in the summer --

53
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,795
the 20-day mark in the winter --

54
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,399
transplant number 2 takes place, this time

55
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,534
to a less crowded styrofoam board

56
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,136
that holds just 72 plants.

57
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,408
this gives the plants more light
and more room to grow.

58
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,344
workers use a hook to avoid damaging the roots.

59
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:36,548
a plant needs healthy roots to absorb water and nutrients.

60
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,024
the last transplant happens on about the 26th day

61
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,760
in the summer, the 45th day in the winter.

62
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,964
now the lettuces go from the 72-plant board

63
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,166
to a board that holds just 18.

64
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:57,235
by now the plants have long roots,

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,638
so they're harder to manipulate.

66
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,520
the lettuces go into the production zone,

67
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,489
the last move before harvesting.

68
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,867
these pools are bigger,

69
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,138
so automatic machines move the boards around.

70
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,481
this hydroponic system

71
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,684
produces 500 plants per square yard,

72
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,620
almost five times the yield of field-grown lettuce,

73
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,088
and it's safer, too.

74
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,025
there's no need here for pesticides or fungicides,

75
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,627
and because it's all indoors,

76
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,363
fertilizer can't contaminate the environment.

77
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,433
by about the 45th day in the summer,

78
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,502
the 75th day in the winter,

79
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,305
the lettuces are finally ready for harvesting.

80
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,775
workers cut off the yellowed leaves at the base,

81
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,912
then either cut off the roots or wrap them around the stem,

82
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,315
depending on how this crop will be sold.

83
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:20,519
then they vacuum-cool each lettuce for longer shelf life.

84
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,528
narrator: an american engineer

85
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,998
has invented a self-mending plastic

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,134
to use for components that vibrate and weaken.

87
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:39,937
when the plastic tears, tiny capsules inside it also tear,

88
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,807
releasing a liquid, like blood from a cut.

89
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,677
then a catalyzing agent also in the plastic

90
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,046
seals the tear like a scar.

91
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,019
there was a time

92
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,355
when if you wanted to build something out of wood,

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,024
you had to pick up an ax and go chop down a tree.

94
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,961
thankfully for city dwellers, all it takes today

95
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,230
is a trip to your local home-improvement center

96
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:08,567
to buy 2x4's, 2x10's -- you name it.

97
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,706
they start with logs cut from spruce or fir trees.

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,711
turning them into construction wood isn't that complicated.

99
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,047
first they soak the logs for about 20 minutes.

100
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,583
this removes the mud

101
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:28,019
and softens the bark to make it easier to remove.

102
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,200
next the logs go through the debarker,

103
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,937
a machine with a rotor that shaves off the bark.

104
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,340
the rotor has six sharp blades

105
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,376
that take just 10 seconds to shave a log bare.

106
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,758
in the filing room,

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,328
they regularly sharpen and inspect the saw blades

108
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,031
they'll use to cut the shaved logs,

109
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,468
straightening them back into shape when necessary.

110
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,846
in this sawmill, there are two production lines.

111
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,248
the wider logs go through this saw.

112
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,787
the worker at the controls uses a laser

113
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,457
to help him position and reposition each log

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,993
as he runs it through the saw several times

115
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:46,398
to cut it into as many 4x10-inch pieces as possible.

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,802
an average log usually yields about seven or eight pieces.

117
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,900
the narrower logs go through a different saw.

118
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,969
this saw first cuts a board off each side,

119
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,139
then sends what's left of the log on to another saw.

120
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,582
the 4x10's on the first production line

121
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,119
go for a second cut called the resaw.

122
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,655
they're cut in half into 2x10's.

123
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,858
the logs on the second production line end up here

124
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,395
in what's called the canter-bull machine.

125
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,797
it has eight adjustable circular saws

126
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,468
that can cut the log into various sizes of wood

127
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,739
anywhere from 2x3's to 2x8's, depending on the log's diameter.

128
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:27,699
both production lines feed to machines that smooth the edges

129
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,701
and trim off any defects that can effect the strength

130
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,604
or resistance of the wood.

131
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,992
then an automated sorter drops the wood into bins

132
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,460
according to their size.

133
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,809
each bin then feeds the stacking machine.

134
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,814
from here they'll put the wood into a kiln to be dried

135
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,484
to about 15% humidity.

136
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,621
then they'll grade the pieces

137
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,460
and ship them to a lumberyard or home-improvement store.

138
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,045
narrator: if you care about our environment,

139
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,914
chances are you separate your recyclable waste

140
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,382
from your other garbage

141
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,384
and either take it to a recycling center

142
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,319
or put it out at the curb for pickup.

143
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,857
but have you ever wondered where it goes from there?

144
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,933
when the truck arrives,

145
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:11,803
your recyclables go through their first sorting.

146
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,677
the worker puts paper and boxes
in one receptacle,

147
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,647
glass, plastics, and metals in another.

148
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,018
at the sorting plant

149
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,289
the truck dumps each receptacle
into a separate area.

150
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,892
then it's on to separate conveyor belts for more sorting.

151
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,761
on the paper-and-boxes line,

152
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,831
workers first remove any plastic, metal, or glass

153
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,299
that got there by mistake.

154
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,969
then they sort what's left into three categories --

155
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,839
first, corrugated cardboard -- what brown boxes are made of --

156
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,309
second, newsprint, and third, mixed-fiber paper

157
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,648
such as cereal boxes, envelopes,
and greeting cards.

158
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,851
on the glass, metal, and plastics conveyor belt,

159
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,787
workers first remove the big bulky items

160
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,923
such as gallon-sized containers.

161
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,659
a jumbo magnet picks up everything metal

162
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,928
except for aluminum, which isn't magnetic.

163
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,132
workers then sort milk and juice cartons to one area,

164
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,466
aluminum to another.

165
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,470
they separate plastics into three categories,

166
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,939
glass into two -- clear and colored.

167
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,873
once everything's been separated,

168
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,011
each category goes into a baler,
which compacts it...

169
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:34,953
...then binds it with wire like a giant bale of hay.

170
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,887
then it's off to the warehouse

171
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,224
until they're sold to a recycler.

172
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,565
at the recycling plant, they cut open a bale of plastics,

173
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,435
then load everything onto the conveyor belt.

174
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,573
the plastics pass through magnets

175
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,843
to remove any metal that might have slipped through.

176
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,846
then it's into the shredder.

177
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,783
it takes the shredder just an hour

178
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,152
to shred two tons of plastic.

179
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,071
all those containers

180
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,542
are now tiny, little plastic flakes.

181
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:33,278
next, cleaning by friction and water.

182
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,014
any remaining glass or other contaminants

183
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,682
now sink to the bottom

184
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,618
while the lighter plastic flakes
float to the top.

185
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,754
the dirty water will be chemically filtered

186
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,656
and used again.

187
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,627
they dry the flakes by hot air,

188
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,664
then put them into silos to be compacted.

189
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:01,639
inside the compactor, it's 320 degrees fahrenheit.

190
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,108
the heat partially melts the plastic,

191
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,710
fusing the pieces as they compact.

192
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,912
the flakes

193
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,381
go through the compactor's perforated inner drum,

194
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,283
much like a pasta press...

195
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,422
...and come out looking a bit like macaroni.

196
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:34,005
they're now officially recycled
plastic

197
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,540
in raw-material form.

198
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,877
next they're melted, pressed through a screen,

199
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,480
then cut into pellets 1/8 inch long.

200
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,651
they drop into water to cool, then go into a dryer.

201
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,089
factories buy these pellets

202
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,159
and use them to make plastic products.

203
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,901
this recycling plant takes the plastic flakes it produces

204
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,969
to mold warehouse pallets.

205
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,106
the mold goes in at 446 degrees fahrenheit

206
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,242
for just about seven or eight minutes.

207
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,847
it takes just 2 1/2 minutes to mold a recycling bin...

208
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,385
...something to help ensure a steady supply

209
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:26,024
of what the factory needs to keep producing recycled plastic.

210
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,670
narrator: still moping about the one that got away?

211
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,739
well, maybe you just didn't use the right fly.

212
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,542
fly-fishing is one of the most challenging types

213
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,743
of sport fishing,

214
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,346
and tying a good fly to the end of your line

215
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,515
can make all the difference.

216
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:01,159
in about 300 a.d., people began
decorating their fishing hooks

217
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,428
to mimic insects and small fish.

218
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,299
the macedonians were known to use a fishing fly

219
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,269
made of red yarn and rooster feathers.

220
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,174
today, with so many synthetic materials available,

221
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,644
the design possibilities are endless.

222
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,378
but every fishing fly

223
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,382
is still based on that centuries-old technique

224
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:28,353
of attaching bird feathers or animal hairs to a hook.

225
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,332
the whole idea is to trick the fish.

226
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,136
the fly imitates an aquatic insect or tiny fish,

227
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,272
something the fish you're trying to catch likes to eat.

228
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:52,043
the flymaker starts by placing a hook in a vise.

229
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,681
using a tool called a bobbin holder,

230
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,151
he winds a waxed nylon thread

231
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:03,021
carefully and tightly around the shank of the hook...

232
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,823
then cuts off the excess.

233
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:11,362
this fly will simulate a mothlike insect called a caddis,

234
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,231
a primary food for trout --

235
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,434
a caddis in the pupal stage of its life cycle,

236
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,770
just before it transforms into an adult.

237
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,308
the flymaker first attaches a special synthetic yarn

238
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,777
to create the tail.

239
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,522
he secures it along the middle of the hook.

240
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,869
he then takes another synthetic
material called dubbing

241
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,539
to create the body.

242
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,609
he spins the dubbing between his fingers onto the thread.

243
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,412
the wax on the thread helps it adhere.

244
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,587
he winds the dubbing over the base of yarn to form the body.

245
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,500
then he folds some yarn over the dubbing

246
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,270
and attaches it with more nylon thread.

247
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,911
then he cuts off the excess.

248
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:41,319
good fishing flies not only look like the real thing,

249
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,589
they also act like it, mimicking
the insect's natural movements.

250
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,393
when a caddis pupa is ready to transform into an adult,

251
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,597
it swims to the surface of the water, then deploys its wings.

252
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,866
the shimmering yarn on this fake caddis

253
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,069
will give the illusion of the air bubbles

254
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,939
this voyage to the surface creates.

255
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,474
to simulate the wings,

256
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,010
the flymaker uses dubbing made of deer fur.

257
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,748
he cuts off the long, coarse hairs known as guard hairs...

258
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,757
...then places them into a device

259
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,226
called a hair stacker.

260
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,328
he shakes it...

261
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,434
...turns it to the side...

262
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,570
then opens it up.

263
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,706
all the hairs are now evenly aligned.

264
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,684
he measures the length he needs
to create the fly's wings.

265
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,590
then he attaches it,

266
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,393
leaving a portion sticking out the front

267
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,263
to form the insect's head.

268
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,867
next he uses a tool called a whip finisher

269
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,537
to tie a sturdy knot made of several loops.

270
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:11,209
this caddis fly imposter

271
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,811
is now ready to trick some trout.

272
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,349
there are thousands of styles of flies.

273
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,818
you choose which to use

274
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,388
according to what fish are feeding on at the moment.

275
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,696
flymakers use many types of natural and synthetic dubbings

276
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,698
to form and decorate their flies --

277
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,034
feathers, animal hairs, metals,

278
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,338
and plastics often dyed brilliant colors.

279
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:55,252
tying a great fly won't always snag you the catch of the day,

280
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,054
but if you maneuver the fly

281
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,790
to make realistic movements in the water,

282
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,060
the fish will buy it -- hook, line, and sinker.

283
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,002
if you have any comments about the show

284
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,472
