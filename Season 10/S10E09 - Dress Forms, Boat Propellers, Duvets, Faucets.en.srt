00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,091
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

4
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,626
         dress forms...         

5
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,499
      ...boat propellers...     

6
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,372
          ...duvets...          

7
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,745
         ...and faucets.        

8
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,922
  when it comes to dressmaking, 
  a dummy can be a lot of help. 

9
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,257
          these dummies         
    are known as dress forms,   

10
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,528
     and they're full-scale     
reproductions of the human body.

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,265
they give seamstresses a form on
which to solve fitting problems.

12
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,267
  they're also used to showcase 
     outfits in storefronts     

13
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,904
where they can look pretty smart
         all dressed up.        

14
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,811
   for centuries, the fashion   
 industry has relied on dummies 

15
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,213
       to act as stand-ins      

16
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,550
 so clients don't have to endure
        lengthy fittings.       

17
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,286
           sometimes,           
   a form is even custom-made   

18
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,956
         as the client's        
       exact body double.       

19
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,227
   to make one of these forms,  

20
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,098
         a worker starts        
 by soaking cardboard in water. 

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,499
     it's strong and porous,    

22
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,469
 so it can absorb a lot of water
     without falling apart.     

23
00:01:47,976 --> 00:01:51,510
   he positions the back half   
     of a plaster body mold,    

24
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:55,648
       then rips a soaked       
     cardboard sheet in two.    

25
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,983
he dips his gloved hand in paste

26
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,519
         and slathers it        
        on the cardboard.       

27
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:04,523
   this paste is a combination  
   of plaster and tacky glue.   

28
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,193
       then, in a process       
       called feathering,       

29
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:11,197
   he makes a series of tears   
along the edge of the cardboard.

30
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,999
 next, the glue-coated cardboard

31
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,602
    is pressed into the shape   
        of the body mold,       

32
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,070
   building up several layers.  

33
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,539
    some pieces are arranged    
           lengthwise           

34
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,643
     and others horizontally    
     for a tight interweave.    

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,281
 overlapping the feathered edges
    helps to interlock them,    

36
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,284
  and a few taps with a hammer  
        makes them level.       

37
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,254
     the worker lifts a few     
    of the feathered edges...   

38
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,225
    ...then joins the front     
    of the body to the back.    

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,896
 the cardboard forms fit loosely
     on top of one another.     

40
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,232
    it takes even more paste    
     to seal them together.     

41
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,169
 the worker manipulates the end 
     of a paste-covered tool    

42
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,306
 inside the cavity, overlapping 
   loose layers with adhesive.  

43
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,577
   finally, he opens the mold   
      to reveal the shape.      

44
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,480
    this dummy is a size 12.    

45
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:08,387
    after 24 hours of drying    
        in the open air,        

46
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,455
   the form goes into an oven   

47
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,526
  where it bakes at 350 degrees 
          for 8 hours.          

48
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,462
    this causes the moisture    
   to evaporate from the form,  

49
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,963
          hardening it.         

50
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,802
    a worker scrapes off all    
  the rough bits with a rasp... 

51
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,741
    ...then sands it smooth.    

52
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,683
   another worker draws lines   
   on the form with a pencil.   

53
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:41,554
 he'll use these marks as guides
 as he cuts into the dress form 

54
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,056
      to make the shoulders     
          collapsible.          

55
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,493
       he carves out slots      
    on each side of the form,   

56
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,897
     then peels back layers     
  on either side of the slots.  

57
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,236
   this allows him to install   
    hinges level to the form    

58
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,473
     so they won't protrude     
     and ruin a fitting job.    

59
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,646
  the dress form then undergoes 
       some major surgery.      

60
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,651
            a worker            
   slices open both shoulders,  

61
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,322
 but leaves them attached to the
 rest of the form by the hinges.

62
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,363
          he makes sure         
    they function smoothly...   

63
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:30,135
  ...then trims the dress form  
      along the incisions.      

64
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,672
 this will allow the shoulders  
 to be collapsed into the form, 

65
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,276
 a feature that makes it easier 
 to pull a garment on and off.  

66
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,550
   this piece of pliable steel  
   is a spring for a mechanism  

67
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,286
    that locks the collapsed    
     shoulders in position.     

68
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,692
       along with the rest      
    of the locking mechanism,   

69
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,529
it's attached to wooden supports
        in each shoulder.       

70
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,174
 the dress form is now covered  
 in layers of jersey and linen. 

71
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,977
      these pins will serve     
       as reference points      

72
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,579
       for the seamstress.      

73
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,718
   another worker then washes   
    the dummy with a sponge,    

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,655
      shrinking the fabric      
          to the form.          

75
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,498
         the dress form         
   gets the stamp of approval.  

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,535
a worker then gives the headless
     body a metal collar...     

77
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,473
       ...and caps it off       
   with a gold-colored finial.  

78
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,579
  and now you have a body shape 
     that's made to measure.    

79
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,086
         when we return,        

80
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:57,256
   we'll take you up to speed   
  at a boat propeller factory.  

81
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,232
            narrator:           
  boat propellers were invented 

82
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,567
   in the early 19th century,   

83
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,303
  and they've been making waves 
           ever since.          

84
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,639
     these propellers rotate    
     in a screwlike fashion,    

85
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,109
        drawing water in        
       and pushing it out       

86
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,378
        to move the boat        
        across the water.       

87
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,187
     with a steel propeller,    

88
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,456
   you can zip across the lake  
           in a flash           

89
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,692
     and make a real splash.    

90
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,729
        production begins       
        with wax pellets,       

91
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,934
 which are melted until they're 
 the consistency of toothpaste. 

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,742
         nearby, a mold         
   of a boat propeller closes,  

93
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,544
        and the thick wax       
      is injected into it.      

94
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,482
     it takes about a minute    

95
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,418
       for the wax to cool      
    into the propeller shape,   

96
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,221
  which will serve as a pattern 
       for the metal prop.      

97
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,031
    a shot of compressed air    

98
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,966
   helps extract a wax funnel   
         from its mold.         

99
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,902
    it's called the pour cup.   

100
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,972
         we'll find out         
 what's poured into it later on.

101
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,511
       after a cast shape       
         is wiped down,         

102
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,047
    its flat end is softened    
           on a burner          

103
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,183
  and joined to the glue-coated 
      end of the pour cup.      

104
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,924
 workers dip the attached pieces
          into hot wax          

105
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,193
 to fill any gaps in the joint. 

106
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,032
     a quick wash and rinse     

107
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,202
  gets rid of any oily residues 
          left behind.          

108
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,547
     here, a robot submerges    
      a rack of propellers      

109
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,218
in a special solution that gives
    them a nonstick coating.    

110
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,958
    then it's over to a tank    

111
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,096
        containing a mix        
    of silica sand and water.   

112
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:20,231
     the robot dips the wax     
    propellers several times,   

113
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,036
 then plunges them into various 
   ceramic-based concoctions.   

114
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,904
       after each dipping,      

115
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,575
the propellers go into a machine
  that showers them with sand.  

116
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,712
    then they dry under fans.   

117
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,386
     the process of dipping     
        and sand bathing        

118
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,390
 builds up a hard ceramic shell 
         around the wax.        

119
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,994
   workers load the propellers  

120
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,729
     into a pressurized oven    
      called an autoclave,      

121
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,734
    where the wax melts away,   
leaving only the ceramic shells.

122
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,938
   those shells are then fired  
          in big ovens,         

123
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,941
  the way potters bake ceramics 
       to strengthen them.      

124
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,946
             nearby,            
    molten steel is bubbling,   

125
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,650
   heated to the melting point  
 by electrical induction coils. 

126
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:19,825
    a worker takes a ceramic    
propeller shell out of the oven,

127
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:23,629
then the searing steel is poured
  into it through the pour cup. 

128
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,102
            the steel           
   immediately begins to cool,  

129
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,671
         causing cracks         
      in the ceramic shell.     

130
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,313
  any remaining bits of ceramic 

131
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,549
         are knocked off        
        with a metal rod.       

132
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,661
          now it's time         
   to get rid of the pour cup,  

133
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,063
        which has already       
       served its purpose.      

134
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,203
      they grind the edges      
         to smooth them.        

135
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,740
 then a more intensive grinding 

136
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,409
      removes any corrosion     
         on the surface.        

137
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,280
talk about putting your shoulder
      to the grindstone --      

138
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,550
          this process          
    takes skill and strength.   

139
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:22,488
the propellers are lowered into 
a series of vibrating polishers.

140
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,090
          the friction          
   from these pulsating cones   

141
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,694
 smooths out the grind lines on 
 the propellers and adds shine. 

142
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,967
     finally, each propeller    
 gets the once-over from a laser

143
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,837
    that measures the blades    
        from all angles.        

144
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,306
    it sends the information    
          to a computer         

145
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,309
        which compares it       
     to the specifications.     

146
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,048
        if it checks out,       

147
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,918
the propeller will be on its way
         to a waterway,         

148
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,586
        ready to launch.        

149
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,895
           up next...           

150
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,732
          getting down          
  on the duvet production line. 

151
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,076
  narrator: "down" is the term  
for belly feathers of waterfowl,

152
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,411
   primarily ducks and geese.   

153
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,079
  made from interlocking fibers 

154
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,014
           that create          
     micro-size air pockets,    

155
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,418
      down works something      
 like a scuba diver's wet suit. 

156
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,354
      the bird's body heat      
     warms the trapped air,     

157
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,925
and the warm air then insulates 
the bird against the cold water.

158
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:38,763
        regular feathers        
       have a central stem      

159
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,732
 from which the fibers emanate. 

160
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:44,570
    down is more lightweight,   
 and its fibers are in clusters.

161
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,306
         bags of plumage        
      from waterfowl farms      

162
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:50,842
 arrive at the feather-and-down 
       processing factory.      

163
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,379
  the first step is to separate 
   the down from the feathers.  

164
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,915
 a vacuum hose sucks everything 
    up into a sorting machine   

165
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,052
   that has four air chambers   
          side by side.         

166
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,188
        in the first one,       
the air blows everything upward.

167
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,592
      the heaviest feathers     
       rise just partway,       

168
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,260
    while the lighter plumage   

169
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,329
    floats through an opening   
     into the next chamber.     

170
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,198
    same air-sorting process    
            there --            

171
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,001
         heaviest stays,        
        lighter moves on.       

172
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,937
         this continues         
  until there's only pure down  

173
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,872
in the fourth and final chamber.

174
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:27,079
a vacuum hose then transfers the
 down to the cleaning machines. 

175
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,616
  first, agitation and suction  

176
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,885
         remove any dirt        
   trapped inside the fibers.   

177
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:38,556
 then a 13-cycle, hot-water wash
    with soap kills bacteria.   

178
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,827
 a degreaser strips the natural 
 oils that coat the down fibers,

179
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,629
    and the last rinse cycle    

180
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,965
    applies an antibacterial,   
      antifungal treatment.     

181
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,503
 the next machine spins the down
      to remove the water.      

182
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:55,240
    when the down comes out,    
     it's still a bit damp.     

183
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,509
        a robotic machine       
        called the picker       

184
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,444
 gathers small batches at a time

185
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,680
         and loads them         
       into a steam dryer.      

186
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,585
        after processing,       

187
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:10,655
the factory's lab tests a sample
from each batch for cleanliness.

188
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,324
           technicians          
      also evaluate "loft,"     

189
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,393
       the technical term       
       for filling power.       

190
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,728
      the higher the loft,      

191
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,864
       the better the down      
         will insulate.         

192
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,801
   they measure how much space  
        the sample fills.       

193
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,136
           if the down          
      meets specifications,     

194
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,607
 the factory bags the batch for 
 shipping to the duvet factory. 

195
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,411
       first stop there --      
         a holding tank.        

196
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,213
 a programmable filling machine 

197
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,949
   extracts a specific amount   
             of down            

198
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,418
 and transfers it to a canister.

199
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,756
         next, a worker         
 shoots the canister's contents 

200
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,891
   in a duvet's fabric shell.   

201
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,760
        to keep the down        
       evenly distributed       

202
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,095
      throughout the duvet,     

203
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:53,098
        the shell is sewn       
   into sections called boxes.  

204
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,936
  emptying one tube at a time,  
  they fill one box at a time.  

205
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:05,444
 air pressure piles all the down
     at one end of the box,     

206
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:08,613
 but it'll get spread out later 
         in the process.        

207
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,585
    the open ends of each row   

208
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,121
     are temporarily closed     
      with a plastic clip.      

209
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,456
    then, when all the boxes    
           are filled,          

210
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,959
            it's off            
    to the sewing department.   

211
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,731
       there, seamstresses      
   stitch the open ends closed  

212
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,801
        and sew on labels       
    and washing instructions.   

213
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,210
a light table allows them to see
    the down within each box.   

214
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,412
 then they spread it out evenly 

215
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,348
      using, of all things,     
       badminton rackets.       

216
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,884
      the 100%-cotton shell     

217
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,488
        has gone through        
    a high-pressure treatment   

218
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,657
   to fuse its fibers so that   
   no down can poke through.    

219
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:59,430
     the factory also stuffs    
  bedding items with feathers.  

220
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,833
 back at the processing factory,

221
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,236
  feathers go through the same  
 post-washing tests as the down.

222
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,972
     to measure cleanliness,    

223
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,240
  lab technicians soak a sample 
         from each batch        

224
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,309
       in distilled water.      

225
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,045
  then they strain the water... 

226
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,382
  mix it with sulfuric acid...  

227
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,784
  and add a potassium compound. 

228
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,986
     they analyze the color     
          of the liquid         

229
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,655
  to gauge its oxygen content.  

230
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,657
 if the oxygen level's under 10,

231
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,894
  the feathers are clean enough 
  to ship to the duvet factory. 

232
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,796
             there,             
   the feather-filling process  

233
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,798
          is just like          
    the down-filling process,   

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,401
   only with bigger canisters   
       and blowing nozzles      

235
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,336
         to accommodate         
       the larger feathers      

236
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,539
    and larger fabric shells.   

237
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,410
 feathers are heavier than down 
 and have less insulating power,

238
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,546
  but they're more affordable.  

239
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,149
       down is only found       
      on the bird's belly,      

240
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,751
        and that scarcity       
       makes it expensive.      

241
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:57,755
   that explains why high-end   
   bedding contains 100% down,  

242
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,691
     while the rest contains    
  either a down-and-feather mix 

243
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,360
       or feathers alone.       

244
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,096
  but when it comes to getting  
      a cozy night's sleep,     

245
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,333
      there's no "downside"     
    to any of those options.    

246
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,840
          coming up...          

247
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,943
  a production line where they  
  know how to go with the flow. 

248
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,587
 narrator: faucets were actually
 invented by the ancient romans.

249
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,456
but when their empire collapsed,

250
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,658
  so did their water and sewer  
            systems.            

251
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,060
     it took many centuries     

252
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,329
       for running water        
       to make a comeback       

253
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,797
          and for water         
   to become available on tap.  

254
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,867
       today, faucets are       
      an indispensable part     

255
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,402
       of our daily lives.      

256
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,142
         modern faucets         
 come in many different designs,

257
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,813
   but inside, they all have    
   the same basic components.   

258
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,616
          workers start         
  by setting a brass spout tube 

259
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,950
     on a revolving support.    

260
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,221
     an automated dispenser     
     applies silver solder      

261
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,157
 to the inside rim of the spout.

262
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,963
    they press a threaded tip   
         into the spout,        

263
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,100
     then dip the other end     
   of the tube in flux paste,   

264
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:18,036
     which cleans the brass     
    and prevents tarnishing.    

265
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:21,172
        the tubes are set       
       against brass hubs.      

266
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,641
then torches liquefy the solder,

267
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,846
  which flows into the joint,   
  sealing the tube to the hub.  

268
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,322
        the threaded tip        
      is soldered in turn.      

269
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,794
           a carriage           
   now moves the faucet spouts  

270
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,730
     against buffing wheels     
 coated with polishing compound 

271
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,766
      for a mirror finish.      

272
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,936
a wheel with an abrasive surface

273
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,205
        gives that finish       
        a brush texture.        

274
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,343
        the faucet spouts       
   are dipped in an acid bath   

275
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,479
  laced with dissolved nickel.  

276
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,682
         the application        
     of an electric current     

277
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:06,284
   draws the dissolved nickel   
     onto the brass spouts,     

278
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,120
          plating them          
    with a thin, even layer.    

279
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,894
     next, the faucet spouts    
         and other parts        

280
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,029
           are loaded           
     into a special chamber.    

281
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,766
    inside, an electron beam    
     flashes like lightning     

282
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,901
          as it spirals         
    around the zirconium rod.   

283
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,905
    this causes the zirconium   
          to vaporize.          

284
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,908
    the vapors mix with gases   
  being pumped into the chamber 

285
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,442
     and bond to the faucet     

286
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,913
       for a final finish       
that's virtually indestructible.

287
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,784
 the other parts of the faucets 
     get the same treatment.    

288
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,397
           meanwhile,           
a blade slices a solid-brass rod

289
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,565
      into smaller pieces.      

290
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,168
   a variety of cutting tools   

291
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,272
     machine the brass lump     
     to make a faucet body.     

292
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,740
   it will house a ball valve   

293
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,411
    that controls the volume    
  and temperature of the water. 

294
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,746
    a jaw grabs the other end   
        of the brass body       

295
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,614
         to position it         
       for more drilling.       

296
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,819
  several tools carve out holes 
   that will act as waterways.  

297
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,921
 the waste brass gets recycled. 

298
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,628
    that piece of solid brass   

299
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,431
  has now been transformed into 
 a pivotal piece for the faucet,

300
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,867
         the valve body.        

301
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,772
        with copper tubes       
and brass fittings now attached,

302
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,308
        the faucet slides       
       into the baseplate.      

303
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,044
        that's the plate        
   that sits on the sink deck.  

304
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,882
    working from underneath,    
   it's fastened with screws.   

305
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,459
   next, a robot puts one-half  
    of a stainless-steel ball   

306
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,728
       in a spinning vice,      
        which orients it        

307
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,931
     so an automated welder     
 can join it to the other half. 

308
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:03,001
    the ball's openings align   
    with hot and cold inlets    

309
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,402
       in the faucet body       

310
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,405
  to regulate the flow of water 
         into the spout.        

311
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,810
    rubber seals are inserted   

312
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,679
     into those inlet holes     
       in the faucet body.      

313
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,884
   rubber o-rings on the body   

314
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,555
      will both form a seal     
 and allow the spout to swivel. 

315
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,625
     in goes the ball valve.    

316
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,962
 then a rubber seal caps it off.

317
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,433
           the aerator          
   is screwed onto the spout,   

318
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,036
      and pneumatic driver      
        tightens it down.       

319
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,106
  the spout assembly is secured 
    to the rest of the faucet   

320
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,742
      with a metal bonnet.      

321
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,183
      now it's time to see      
   how this faucet functions.   

322
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:55,586
    an inspector connects it    
  to a pressurized water source 

323
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,121
         for a test run.        

324
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,792
 finally, the handle is attached
   to the rest of the faucet,   

325
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,927
   and it's ready to ship out.  

326
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,469
   included in the box are the  
 spray hose and support system, 

327
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,539
which will be installed on-site.

328
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,009
      it takes a day or two     
 to build one of these faucets. 

329
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,713
 but it will be on clean-up duty
     for many years to come.    

330
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,016
