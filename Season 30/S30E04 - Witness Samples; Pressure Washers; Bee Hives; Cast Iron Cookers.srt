370
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,368
          for the shaft         
     that will connect them.    

371
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,437
 he drills holes in the fire box

372
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,973
      that will let in air      
        to feed the fire.       

373
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,844
        using a template        
        and laser cutter,       

374
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,548
he cuts an opening in the bottom
 for the ventilation-draft door.

375
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,120
    he drills mounting holes    
        around the vent,        

376
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:18,323
  and installs the draft door.  

377
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,058
    its perforated hole cover   
          lets air in.          

378
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,795
     its solid sliding door     
          shuts it out.         

379
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:27,165
 the air intake feeding the fire
 regulates cooking temperature. 

380
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:33,604
         the cooker sits        
  in a hand-crafted steel cart. 

381
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,341
    a welder places the parts   
      for the cart's frame      

382
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:40,545
     in an assembly fixture,    
 which positions them correctly.

383
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,881
    after welding the frame,    
     he files down the welds    

384
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,683
       so that they'll be       
       virtually invisible      

385
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,485
   once the frame is painted.   

386
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,821
                     ♪          

387
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,158
      this computer-guided      
         lathe machines         

388
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,562
   the cart's cast-iron wheels  
    to the final dimensions.    

389
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,632
   the sand molds used to cast  
    the wheels were designed    

390
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:05,236
        using century-old       
 patterns for cast-iron pulleys.

391
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,505
    once workers have mounted   
         the two wheels,        

392
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:10,909
the cart goes off to be painted.

393
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,645
 then, a worker installs shelves
 made of either stainless steel,

394
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,515
            hardwood,           
  or composite decking planks.  

395
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,654
  workers bolt the bottom half  
   of the cooker to the cart.   

396
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,456
then they lower in the fire box,

397
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,657
      which holds the fuel      
          for cooking.          

398
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,061
      the recommended fuel      
   is hardwood lump charcoal.   

399
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,734
      next, a worker mounts     
 the cooker's temperature gauge.

400
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,871
 then he installs the top vent. 

401
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,473
       it consists of two       
         cast-iron discs        

402
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:46,310
 which rotate to let in more air
          or less air.          

403
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,745
  having adjustable ventilation 

404
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,080
         at both the top        
    and bottom of the cooker    

405
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,685
      enables more precise      
      temperature control.      

406
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,555
  they position the top of the  
     cooker over the bottom,    

407
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,625
  and mate the two hinge halves 
      with the steel shaft      

408
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,828
and two stainless-steel springs.

409
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,564
 fiber gaskets ensure good seal 
         when the cooker        

410
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,968
            is closed           
   over the cast-iron grates.   

411
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,702
  those grates are reversible,  

412
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,238
      with one side higher      
         than the other,        

413
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,375
  providing a choice of cooking 
     heights above the fire.
