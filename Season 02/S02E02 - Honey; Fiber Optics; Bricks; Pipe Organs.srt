00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,457
            narrator:           
   today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,360
           ...honey...          

3
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,229
         fiber optics...        

4
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,764
            bricks...           

5
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,632
        and pipe organs.        

6
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,838
     it's winnie the pooh's     
         favorite treat.        

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,040
     it's sweet and sticky.     

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,244
        and it's produced       
    by an industrious insect,   

9
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,979
     whose miniature society    

10
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,249
is one of the most sophisticated
     in the animal kingdom.     

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,187
    it all begins in a field,   

12
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,256
     where worker honeybees     
           suck nectar          

13
00:00:57,258 --> 00:01:00,259
      from flower blossoms,     
         such as clover.        

14
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,727
          they store it         
      in their honey sack,      

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,263
    then return to the hive,    

16
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,665
    where other worker bees     
    suck it out and chew it,    

17
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,735
          breaking down         
   the nectar's complex sugars  

18
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:14,339
     into two simple sugars     
  called glucose and fructose.  

19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,008
the bees then deposit the nectar
         into the cells         

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,010
      of the wax honeycombs     
         they've built.         

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,612
  they fan it with their wings  

22
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,681
          until most of         
  its water content evaporates  

23
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,417
 in the warm air of the beehive.

24
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,754
           what's left          
    is thick and gooey honey.   

25
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,758
     the bees then cap each     
 honey-filled cell with beeswax.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,095
           that's when          
     the beekeeper steps in.    

27
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,498
         bees will sting        
      if taken by surprise,     

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,567
so the beekeeper sprays the hive

29
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,768
           with smoke           
   from burning pine needles,   

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,371
        a scented warning       
         that foreigners        

31
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,373
  are about to enter the hive.  

32
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,377
   inside the hive are wooden   
  frames hanging side by side,  

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,379
    each holding a honeycomb.   

34
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,983
        a hive can house        
 hundreds of thousands of bees, 

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,253
 all descendants of the prolific
    grand pooh-bah of beedom,   

36
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,188
         the queen bee.         

37
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,257
she's the big one in the middle.

38
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,326
       the queen bee lays       
     up to 2,000 eggs a day,    

39
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,330
 creating the work force needed 
 to feed and protect the colony.

40
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,068
        but the beekeeper       
 tricks the colony's defenders. 

41
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,137
  he replaces the hive's cover  

42
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,072
      with a device called      
          a bee escape,         

43
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:22,141
   that smells like cherries.   

44
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,342
     bees dislike the scent,    

45
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:28,147
         so most fly to         
the bottom sections of the hive.

46
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,015
     another warning spray,     

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,751
        and the beekeeper       
     removes the bee escape.    

48
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,723
        now he can escape       
      with the honeycombs.      

49
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,834
    inside the honey factory,   
  they put the honeycomb frames 

50
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,170
        on what's called        
      an uncapping machine.     

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,572
          like a razor,         

52
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,942
 it shaves the wax caps off the 
honey-filled cells of the combs.

53
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:04,616
         they scrape off        
     the remnants manually.     

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,787
    then they set the frames    
       on another machine       

55
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,325
    called a honey extractor.   

56
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,327
     it spins the honeycombs    

57
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,664
       until all the honey      
   is forced out of the cells.  

58
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,598
           afterwards,          
      they filter the honey     

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,203
   to remove any pieces of wax  
  capping that slipped through. 

60
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:28,140
     then the honey is ready    
          for bottling.         

61
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:31,076
          some beehives         
     contain smaller frames,    

62
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,811
    designed to produce honey   

63
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,480
      that isn't extracted      
      from the honeycomb.       

64
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,882
    workers remove the frame    

65
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,284
      and cut the honeycomb     
        into pieces as is       

66
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,753
      with a heated knife.      

67
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,757
       that seals the wax       
    around the honey inside.    

68
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,766
    you eat it, wax and all.    

69
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:01,306
    the beeswax lining of the   
 honeycomb goes to make candles,

70
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:05,043
  furniture polish, lipsticks,  
       and other products.      

71
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,584
    when producers have more    
liquid honey than they can sell,

72
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,920
  they simply let it granulate, 
     develop sugar crystals,    

73
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,656
    and turn hard and white.    

74
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,725
 then, when the orders come in, 

75
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,327
         they return it         
   to its original liquid form  

76
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,130
  by heating it to 130 degrees. 

77
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,568
  they vacuum-clean the jars... 

78
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,810
       ...then fill them.       

79
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,948
      one beehive can yield     
   up to seven pounds of honey  

80
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,285
        in a single day.        

81
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,154
      that's much more than     
  the bees need for themselves. 

82
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,823
       the surplus is what      
        we end up eating.       

83
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,832
     honey production today     
  is both efficient and humane. 

84
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,770
   for centuries, the only way  
   to harvest honey from hives  

85
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,838
   had been to kill the bees.   

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,441
         then, in 1851,         

87
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:13,178
      an american beekeeper     
invented a way to get the honey,

88
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,579
       yet spare the bees.      

89
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:18,316
 his method, with the removable 
        honeycomb frames,       

90
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,886
 is the one we still use today. 

91
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,929
 narrator: american researchers 
     have invented a plastic    

92
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,898
that repairs itself when broken.

93
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,201
       just apply heat --       
 a simple hair dryer will do -- 

94
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,270
          and the break         
   automatically mends itself.  

95
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,874
       this could solve a       
longtime problem in electronics,

96
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,477
     because when components    
     heat up and cool down,     

97
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,913
     they weaken the plastic    
          around them.          

98
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:57,555
every time you talk on the phone
     or go on the internet,     

99
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,492
      what you say or type      
   travels to its destination   

100
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,828
      through fiber optics,     

101
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,629
 voice and data gets transmitted

102
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:09,067
       via pulses of light      
 through hair-thin glass fibers.

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,841
          those fibers          
 start out as large glass tubes.

104
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,044
first, workers unwrap the tubes.

105
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,854
     then they submerge them    

106
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,523
      in a corrosive bath       
      of hydrofluoric acid      

107
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,660
 that removes any oil residues. 

108
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,998
      then they set a tube      
    into each end of a lathe.   

109
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,738
       as the tubes spin,       

110
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,075
         they're heated         
  with a hydrogen-oxygen flame. 

111
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,476
   when the glass turns white,  

112
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,812
       it's getting close       
  to hitting peak temperature.  

113
00:06:54,814 --> 00:07:00,818
     at about 3,500 degrees,    
  the two tubes fuse together.  

114
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,890
       they put this new,       
 longer tube onto another lathe.

115
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,892
       as the tube spins,       

116
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,829
      they inject a mixture     
    of chemical gases inside,   

117
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,232
    while a traversing burner   
      heats everything up.      

118
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,636
    the gas mixture contains    
   liquid forms of silicon --   

119
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,238
  an abundant chemical element  
       found in nature --       

120
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,573
         and germanium,         

121
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,041
       a chemical element       
         similar to tin         

122
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,912
 that's used as a semiconductor 
         in transistors         

123
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,314
  and other electronic devices. 

124
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,717
       as the gases heat,       
they undergo a chemical reaction

125
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,720
    that leaves a white soot    
on the inside of the glass tube.

126
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,190
    the heat fuses the soot,    

127
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,725
        forming what will       
   eventually become the core   

128
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,260
      of the optical fiber.     

129
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,397
      the glass tube itself     
 will form the fiber's covering.

130
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,465
 when there's enough fused soot,

131
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,869
 they turn up the heat until the
  soot itself turns into glass. 

132
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,738
  then they heat the glass tube 
      enough to soften it,      

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,141
          and to soften         
      the new glass inside.     

134
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,942
   the intense heat eventually  

135
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,744
         makes the tube         
       collapse on itself       

136
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,880
      to form a solid rod.      

137
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:05,884
  the internal structure of the 
optical fiber has been achieved.

138
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,955
 but it's in the form of a big, 
   bulky rod called a preform,  

139
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,356
        so the next step        
       is to thin it out.       

140
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,358
 first, they excise the preform 

141
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,662
  from the uncollapsed section  
       of the glass tube.       

142
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,705
 then they install it vertically
     into the drawing tower,    

143
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,641
       which will draw out      
        the final shape.        

144
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,924
    the drawing tower's oven    

145
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:51,263
  heats one end of the preform  
        to 3,600 degrees.       

146
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,241
       the glass softens.       

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,948
   gravity helps pull it down,  

148
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,619
       like honey dripping      
          from a spoon.         

149
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:27,165
   then, using a glob of glass  
          as a weight,          

150
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,901
   they stretch the soft glass  
     and keep stretching it     

151
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,371
      until they've formed      
      a thin glass fiber.       

152
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,843
  a series of pulleys measures  
    the tension on the fiber    

153
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,645
      as it's being drawn.      

154
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,179
  a special monitor makes sure  

155
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,849
      the fiber's precisely     
      the right diameter --     

156
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,253
      just .005 of an inch.     

157
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,657
         then the fiber         
    passes through u.v. lamps   

158
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,659
 that bake on an acrylic coating

159
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,729
     to protect against dust    
     and other contaminants.    

160
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,599
       finally, the fiber       
     is rolled onto a drum.     

161
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,668
           from here,           
  it's either shipped out as is 

162
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,070
      or put into a cable.      

163
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,874
       fiber-optic cables       
    are expensive to produce,   

164
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,611
 but they're smaller and lighter
 than traditional copper cables.

165
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,148
   they carry more information  
    and need fewer repeaters    

166
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,150
       to keep the signal       
       from deteriorating.      

167
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,952
   and, unlike copper cables,   

168
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,022
        they're immune to       
  electromagnetic interference. 

169
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,958
    they're also hard to tap    
    without being detected.     

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,760
  and all this is made possible 

171
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:33,231
 by a complicated process based 
 on a very simple principle --  

172
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:36,001
 light traveling through glass. 

173
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,712
            narrator:           
     those three little pigs    
    knew what they were doing   

174
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,647
         when they built        
        that brick house.       

175
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,716
 not only are bricks wolf-proof,

176
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,118
     they're also fireproof,    
         pest-resistant,        

177
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,253
     and weather-resistant.     

178
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,056
            no wonder           
   they're one of the world's   

179
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,458
   oldest building materials.   

180
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,329
 bricks are often made of shale,

181
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,533
     a lightweight rock that    
 splits easily into thin layers.

182
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:12,269
         quarry machines        
       dig 16 inches down       

183
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,807
       to expose the shale      
  to the elements for 2 years.  

184
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,208
        this weakens it,        

185
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,545
  making it easier to process   
  once it gets to the factory.  

186
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,481
    a 4-foot-high stone wheel   

187
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:27,018
        with a steel tire       
  grinds the shale into powder. 

188
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,421
      it grinds up 50 tons      
       of shale per hour.       

189
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,959
  a screen sifts out any pieces 
    that need more grinding.    

190
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,899
 the powder goes to the pug mill
    that mixes it with water.   

191
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,500
    this makes a thick paste    

192
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,336
      that will go through      
   the extrusion machine next.  

193
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:51,776
  the extruder forces the paste 
  through a rectangular opening 

194
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,313
        to form one long,       
 continuous piece called a slug.

195
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,516
 at the same time, it shaves off
     the crustier top layer     

196
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,986
   to expose what will become   
     the face of the brick.     

197
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:05,390
   if this gray shale mixture   
         is fired as is,        

198
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,661
    it will naturally produce   
          a red brick.          

199
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:13,331
 to engineer a different color, 
   they coat the slug in sand   

200
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:18,335
   mixed with an oxide mineral  
      such as zinc or iron.     

201
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:22,073
 next, they texture the surface 
     with a textured roller.    

202
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,610
        this is just one        
    of many popular designs.    

203
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,814
       then a large knife       
  comes down like a guillotine  

204
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,117
      and slices the slug       
      into 5-foot lengths.      

205
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:39,023
  you might be wondering where  
  those three holes came from.  

206
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,359
  well, remember how the paste  
    goes through the extruder   

207
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,694
        to form the slug?       

208
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,964
     inside are three pins.     

209
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,769
 they make three holes designed 
 to decrease the brick's weight.

210
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,106
   out of each 5-foot length,   
   they cut 20 3-inch bricks.   

211
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,908
the ones on the ends are uneven,

212
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,245
  so they go back into the mix  
       to make new slugs.       

213
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,047
   next comes the delicate job  

214
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,684
        of stacking these       
   newly minted bricks-to-be.   

215
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,323
 a machine first separates them.

216
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:20,131
   then, using inflating bags,  
         it grasps them,        

217
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,766
         raises them...         

218
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,807
      ...then stacks them.      

219
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:35,280
   meanwhile, the water in the  
bricks is starting to evaporate.

220
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,215
     to hasten that process,    

221
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,550
   the bricks go into a dryer   
          for two days.         

222
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:44,088
 the dryer gets its hot air from
 the heat generated by the kiln,

223
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,690
    where the bricks go next    
           for firing.          

224
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,829
the kiln is really a giant oven.

225
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,232
       it bakes the bricks      
        at 1,900 degrees.       

226
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,520
        1 1/2 days later,       
      the bricks are ready.     

227
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,324
      the transfer machine      
   takes them out of the kiln.  

228
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,125
  but before they go to market, 

229
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,794
          a technician          
      does a quality check.     

230
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,596
 he weighs and measures a sample

231
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,867
       to see if it meets       
   the design specifications.   

232
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,536
     bricks are supposed to     
       absorb some water,       

233
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,138
        but not too much.       

234
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,742
          yet, if they          
     repel water completely,    

235
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,744
       they'll also repel       
 the wet mortars the masons use 

236
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,680
  to stick the bricks together. 

237
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,214
     so to test absorbancy,     

238
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,417
         the technician         
     breaks a brick in half.    

239
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,153
  he weighs it before and after 

240
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,356
       soaking it in water      
          for 24 hours.         

241
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,957
    by comparing the weights,   

242
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,027
    he can see how much water   
     the brick has absorbed.    

243
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,096
  once the batch gets the okay, 

244
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,699
      they stack the bricks     
    into cubes of 500 to 600.   

245
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,569
 each brick weighs 5 1/2 pounds,

246
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,372
     so each cube weighs in     
        at about 1/4 ton.       

247
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,377
  brick is one of the sturdiest 
   building materials around.   

248
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,046
      it doesn't rot, fade,     
          warp, or dent         

249
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,048
          the way some          
      other materials can.      

250
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,650
         bricks are also        
        energy-efficient.       

251
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,987
    they absorb heat to help    
  cool your house in the summer 

252
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,492
      and hold heat to help     
  keep it warmer in the winter. 

253
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,672
  narrator: the music it makes  
is as complex as it is majestic.

254
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,073
         the pipe organ         
      is one of the largest

00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:00,424
            early man           
 discovered he could make music 

259
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,429
 by blowing across hollow reeds 
      of different lengths.

       an engineer devised      
     what would later become    

262
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,768
      the basic technology      
       of the pipe organ,

   to create different notes.   

266
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,576
       by the middle ages,      

267
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,580
  the pipe organ was a fixture  
 in churches throughout europe.

00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:26,984
 johann sebastian bach composed 
  his greatest works for organ  

269

        a concept artist        
       creates the design.      

272
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,413
      the design then goes      
       to a draftsperson,       

273
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,683
          who prepares          
     the technical drawings.    

274
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:03,154
   the organ's pipes are made   
  of a mixture of tin and lead. 

275
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,958
   tin -- the harder metal --   
 gives brightness to the sound, 

276
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,426
          while lead --

          artisans pour         
  the molten alloy into a tray, 

279
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,835
        then draw it out        
        to form a sheet.        

280

       as the sheet cools,      

281
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,774
      the two metals react      
 to each other, creating spots. 

282
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,177
   the sheet goes into storage  

283
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,046

        and large rulers.       

288
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,330
    then they roll each piece   
        using a mandrel.        

289
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,800
     the larger the organ,      
     the more pipes it has.     

290

 the body of each pipe by hand, 

295

303
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,644
      he enlarges the mouth     
 of the pipe, called the cut-up,

304
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,248
    until it's approximately    
    1/4 of the width across.    

305
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,850
 he adjusts the pipe some more, 

306
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:44,288
 blowing air through it to judge
 how to further refine the tone.

307
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,866
    next come the windchests,   
  also called the soundboards.  

308
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,336
these are the large wooden boxes

      under each pipe is an     
 air channel covered by a valve.

     the corresponding valve    
   drops down like a trapdoor,
