00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,587
           narrator:            
     the first armored car      

4
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,256
         was developed          
   in the late 19th century.    

5
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,659
           first used           
     as scouting vehicles,      

6
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,596
  they quickly became a source  
     of protection in modern    
            warfare.            

7
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:07,199
     today, private armored     
            vehicles            
   are made for celebrities,    

8
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,670
            c.e.o.s,            
   and government officials.    

9
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:18,411
      this armored s.u.v.       
  looks like an ordinary car,   

10
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,280
      but it's reinforced       
    with bulletproof steel      

11
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:26,151
            and has             
  transparent armor windows.    

12
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,420
           a designer           
   integrates armored parts     

13
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:34,960
  into the original design of   
the car using a 3d cad system.  

14
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,896
       a c.n.c. precision       
         laser cutter           

15
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:40,700
    shapes the armored parts    
    out of a ballistic steel    
             sheet.             

16
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,912
  a mechanic tests the steel's  
     ballistic resistance       

17
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:55,514
   using a high-power rifle.    

18
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,116
    he makes sure the armor     

19
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,853
      meets international       
  ballistic impact standards.   

20
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,121
       a mechanic starts        

21
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,257
 by removing the inside covers  
    and liners of the car,      

22
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,893
       stripping it down        
     to the chassis frame.      

23
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,666
       now the mechanics        
    can install the armor.      

24
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:17,770
  they weld bulletproof steel   
 sheets to the chassis frame.   

25
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,742
         they reinforce         
         the car floor          

26
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:25,411
      with blast-absorbent      
         steel sheets           

27
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,946
          and install           
    ballistic armored steel     

28
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,350
            to cover            
   the interior cabin walls.    

29
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,286
      a mechanic now uses       
      an electric grinder       

30
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:39,291
  to remove the standard-steel  
     panels from the door.      

31
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:43,295
      armored steel plates      
designed to fit to the chassis  

32
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,698
     are welded in place.       

33
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,970
           at the end           
        of the process,         

34
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:55,107
     the vehicle is armored     
      from top to bottom.       

35
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,244
 the armor adds around two tons 
   of weight to the vehicle,    

36
00:02:58,246 --> 00:02:59,979
    depending on the model,     

37
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:06,184
   so each vehicle is equipped  
              with              
 an adapted suspension system.  

38
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,656
 a welder assembles a fuel-tank 
 casing using ballistic steel.  

39
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:15,060
  he arranges the metal to form 
                a               
   protective shell around the  
              tank              

40
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,863
           then welds           
     the pieces together.       

41
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,606
     another worker applies     
   electrostatic, anti-rust,    

42
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,274
  and flame-retardant paint,    

43
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,409
      designed to prevent       
    the tank from exploding     

44
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,579
  if exposed to open flames.    

45
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:42,220
 a welder attaches the fuel pan 
  to the bulletproof casing.    

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:47,092
     he uses a mig torch to     
            tack-weld           
    the pan onto the armored    
             steel.             

47
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:52,198
   the c.n.c.-designed casing   
    fits perfectly around the   
             tank.              

48
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,040
    mechanics now reassemble    
     the interior fitting,      

49
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,441
   air-conditioning system,     

50
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,979
     and electrical wiring      
   running through the roof.    

51
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,849
   another worker reattaches    
      the original panels       

52
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,587
   to the armored door frame    

53
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:18,891
   and puts the door-lock and   
window controls back in place.  

54
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,798
 they cover the blast-absorbent 
    steel with floor mats,      

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,601
       then they bring in       
    the rear bulkhead door,     

56
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,736
      which is upholstered      
      to match the original     
           interior.            

57
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,941
   the bulletproof door can be  
              used              
 as an emergency escape hatch.  

58
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,743
     it opens horizontally      

59
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:45,150
 because the door is too heavy  
  for hatch lifts to support.   

60
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,287
        now they install        
        the windshield.         

61
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,889
           it's made            
 of transparent armored glass.  

62
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,491
  the thickness of the glass    

63
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:56,629
    depends on the ballistic    
    standard the car needs to   
             meet.              

64
00:04:56,631 --> 00:05:00,299
  he installs runflat devices   
   made of composite plastic    

65
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,567
      inside the wheels.        

66
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,970
      this allows the car       
to keep rolling on a flat tire  

67
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,438
      for 40 to 50 miles        

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,376
         at a speed of          
   up to 50 miles per hour.     

69
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,848
      a mechanic tightens       
   the device around the rim    

70
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,052
      before a robotic arm      
    attaches the tire to the    
             wheel.             

71
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,322
           he labels            
     the reinforced wheel       

72
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,593
    with the specifications     
     of the runflat device      

73
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,929
         and mounts it          
       back on the car.         

74
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,669
        a keen observer         
      may see the overlap       

75
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,073
    between the edge of the     
doorframe and the main chassis  

76
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,876
      or notice the unusual     
            thickness           
        of the windows,         

77
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,744
         but the design         
         of these cars          

78
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,480
        makes them look         
    perfectly normal to most    
            people,             

79
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,650
      even though they are      
as protected as armored tanks.  

80
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,298
           narrator:            
   a tension fabric building    

81
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,433
     combines the benefits      
   of a tent and a building     

82
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,870
   into a single structure.     

83
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,439
        it has a strong,        
      load-resistant roof       

84
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,908
 and a sturdy steel structure   

85
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,510
       but can be quickly       
 dismantled and reconstructed   

86
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,912
      at a new location.        

87
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,318
         you often see          
   tension fabric buildings     

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,254
            on farms            
   or at public works yards.    

89
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:31,123
       they're often used       
      to store equipment        

90
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,259
       and bulk materials       
   like gravel or road salt.    

91
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:40,733
    tension fabric buildings    
      can also house small      
           factories.           

92
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,802
        the fabric cover        
 is high-density polyethylene,  

93
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,473
        a material known        
 for its exceptional strength.  

94
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:53,078
 it can withstand strong winds  
 and heavy snow accumulation.   

95
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
           following            
     the engineer's plan,       

96
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,017
          workers cut           
the required sheets of fabric.  

97
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,620
       then, the assembly       
        process begins.         

98
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:06,558
   they flatten and tape down   
  the first sheet to immobilize 
               it               

99
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,829
 then overlap the second sheet  
        by two inches.          

100
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:16,302
   they tape down that sheet    
    to keep it in position.     

101
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:21,407
  then, with a hot-air welder,  
    they melt the overlapping   
             edges              

102
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,243
    and press them together     
      with heavy wheels.        

103
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,547
      this fuses the edges      
      into a strong seam.       

104
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,923
 workers use this same process  
  to weld on tension pockets    

105
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,992
          two feet in           
  from the bottom and sides.    

106
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,996
    each pocket will contain    
      a steel or pvc tube       

107
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,930
     holding nylon straps.      

108
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,800
     the straps are spaced      
      2 to 10 feet apart,       

109
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,536
          depending on          
      the building size.        

110
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,271
      they apply tension        

111
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,943
   to fasten the fabric down    
   over the steel structure.    

112
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,879
      the assembled sheets      
      form a single cover       

113
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:04,215
    that goes over the sides    
   and roof of the building.    

114
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:08,820
    separate covers are made    
 for the front and back walls.  

115
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,491
 the covers of larger buildings 
     are made differently.      

116
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:18,030
    workers connect multiple    
             covers             
     with a keter system.       

117
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:21,767
    keter is an ultra-strong    
      pvc or nylon rope.        

118
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:25,303
          an automated          
        hot-air welder          

119
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,740
 folds the edges of each cover  
        over the keter.         

120
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,379
  the fabric-sealed rope edge   

121
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,448
       will slide snugly        
   into an aluminum channel     

122
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,517
       in the building's        
        roof structure.         

123
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,123
  when the cover is finished,   

124
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,559
    workers fan-fold it...      

125
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,033
     ...then roll it up for     
            transport           
   to the installation site.    

126
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,805
       for the building's       
       steel structure,         

127
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,807
          the factory           
      orders steel tubing       

128
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,876
        and cuts pieces         
   to the required lengths.     

129
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,547
 the steel is coated with zinc  
     to prevent corrosion.      

130
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,489
      works put the tubes       
         into a press           

131
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,226
      to flatten the ends       
  into connectable surfaces.    

132
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:26,565
  at the same time, the press   
   punches holes for bolts.     

133
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,836
         for buildings          
      with a rounded top,       

134
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,238
        works bend tubes        
       for the trusses,         

135
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,043
        a main component        
     of the roof framing.       

136
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,845
          the operator          
    programs in the required    
            radius,             

137
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,715
        and the machine         
automatically adjusts the dies  

138
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,118
       to curve the tube        
         accordingly.           

139
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,858
  workers then place the parts  
    for each truss segment      

140
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,061
       in an assembly jig       
    to prepare for welding.     

141
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,400
         they tack-weld         
      the parts together        

142
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:08,339
    so they come off the jig    
       as a single unit.        

143
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,610
      at the next station,      
  workers finish the welding.   

144
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,612
       this truss segment       
 will connect with six others,  

145
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,217
    forming a 200-foot truss    
             running            
      the full width of the     
           building.            

146
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,288
    to keep up with the high    
             demand,            
   robots do all the welding    

147
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,960
       for this factory's       
     most-popular models.       

148
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,094
        welding removes         
      the galvanization,        

149
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,631
     which keeps the steel      
     corrosion-resistant,       

150
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,768
  so the last step is to spray  
 zinc-rich paint on the welds   

151
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,371
           to restore           
       that protection.         

152
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:45,377
   a tension fabric building    

153
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,381
 typically takes a team of four 
  just a few days to set up.    

154
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,648
     it can be customized       

155
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,984
  to attach to different types  
        of foundations          

156
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,022
        and be designed         
with windows and garage doors.  

157
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,076
   narrator: rowing machines    
    were invented in the late   
             1800s.             

158
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,612
      these early versions      
       were rudimentary         

159
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,348
 but helped competitive rowers  
   train in the off-season.     

160
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,817
    as technology improved,     

161
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,220
        rowing machines         
  gained a much wider appeal.   

162
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:31,356
     today's machines offer     
 a realistic rowing experience  

163
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,126
        without putting         
     an oar in the water.       

164
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,099
   when the weather is bad,     

165
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:45,637
        a rowing machine        
can bring the workout indoors.  

166
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,373
        to make a rower,        
      a computerized tool       

167
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,509
     punches assembly holes     
     in high-carbon steel.      

168
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,113
    then, a laser carves out    
  the parts around the holes.   

169
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,116
    these parts will be used    
     to create the housing      

170
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,186
        for the rower's         
     flywheel and brakes.       

171
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:06,858
  they fold the edges using a   
    bench press, making neat    
             flaps.             

172
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,198
    next up is the main tube    
        for the rower.          

173
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,602
    all the other components    
   will attach to this part.    

174
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:23,275
  a punch cuts assembly holes   
     into the steel tube.       

175
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:29,214
    then, an employee places    
the tube in a welding fixture.  

176
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:33,885
     he positions the stand     
 of the seat frame at one end.  

177
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,888
         a robot welds          
     the stand to the tube      

178
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,425
        and welds mounts        
      for the seat rail.        

179
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,628
    they apply a powder-coat    
             finish             
       to the assembly,         

180
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,399
making it corrosion-resistant.  

181
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:52,503
     an employee places the     
            flywheel            
  housing parts in a fixture    

182
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,573
         and activates          
     an automated welder,       

183
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,044
   which fuses them together    
         at the seams.          

184
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,981
        they powder-coat        
      this assembly, too.       

185
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,450
         plastic wheels         
      with metal bearings       

186
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,587
         allow the seat         
    to slide on the rails.      

187
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,389
            a worker            
      screws four wheels        

188
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:14,926
      to the carrier plate      
     under the rower seat.      

189
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,263
    now an employee applies     
 a decal with the company name  

190
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,399
       to the main tube.        

191
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,070
 he inserts a pulley in a notch 
    at the end of the tube.     

192
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:30,876
    next, he sets the chrome    
    seat rail on the mounts     

193
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,678
  and secures it with screws.   

194
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,348
      he attaches the ends      
      of the chrome rail        

195
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,216
   to eyelets on the stand.     

196
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,756
     he screws plastic feet     
  to the bottom of the stand.   

197
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,358
      at another station,       

198
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,961
   a worker places a bearing    
 in the center of the flywheel  

199
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,831
        and uses a press        
         to secure it.          

200
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,434
    next, he pulls a black,     
 plastic cord through a spool   

201
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,836
   and knots it at the end.     

202
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,377
     he also pulls a white,     
   rubberized cord through,     

203
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:10,848
     then mounts the spool      
  to a shaft in the flywheel.   

204
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,053
    he locks the spool to the   
              shaft             
   with a special steel ring    

205
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:20,192
    and winds the black cord    
       around the spool.        

206
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,460
      he puts the flywheel      
     in the steel housing       

207
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:27,265
    and screws it in place.     

208
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,200
     using a hooked tool,       

209
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,504
    he grabs a spring linked    
     to the magnetic braking    
            system.             

210
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,943
           he fastens           
    this end of the spring      

211
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,046
           to a hole            
   in the flywheel housing.     

212
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:48,019
  a team now threads the white  
   pull cord through the main   
              tube              

213
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:52,356
 and uses the pulley at the end 
       to loop it back.         

214
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:57,829
     a piece of metal cable     
            attached            
   the end of the pull cord     

215
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,633
    makes it easier to snake    
  the cord through the tube.    

216
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:07,706
      now a worker unwinds      
    some of the black cord.     

217
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,775
 he threads it through a guide  
    on the flywheel housing     

218
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,577
        and attaches it         
       to the handlebar,        

219
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,047
    also known as the oar.      

220
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,584
         he pushes caps         
      into the ends of the      
           handlebar,           

221
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:24,990
      then rests it on top      
   of the flywheel housing.     

222
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:28,193
    another employee builds     
 a protective outer structure   

223
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,928
      around the flywheel       
         steel housing          

224
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,063
          using molded          
        plastic parts.          

225
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,869
       he installs a port       
   for the electrical system    

226
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,405
          that powers           
     the workout computer.      

227
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,743
   the top part of the casing   
    contains the computer.      

228
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:49,681
     the computer measures      
    row strokes and calories    
            burned.             

229
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,883
          after making          
all the necessary connections,  

230
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,286
    he screws it in place.      

231
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,089
        a plastic cradle        
    supports the assembly.      

232
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,225
     it snaps into place.       

233
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,963
         once the seat          
         is attached,           

234
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:09,534
      this rowing machine       
    is ready for a workout.     

235
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,185
           narrator:            
 until recently, if a sculptor  
    wanted to create a large    

236
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,454
        they had to make        
     their model by hand,       

237
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,722
       but now an artist        

238
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,391
 can make a small-scale replica 
        of their statue         

239
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,860
     and have a large copy      
         made in foam.          

240
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,061
           the artist           
    can then use this model     

241
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,464
    to make their full-size     
          sculpture,            

242
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:43,001
          saving them           
   a lot of time and money.     

243
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:47,138
  a full-size sculpture starts  
               out              
    as a small clay model.      

244
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,074
           the artist           
      uses the clay model       

245
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,210
         to make a mold         
out of wax, plaster, or resin.  

246
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,480
     the artist then sends      
  the copy, called a maquette   

247
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,283
        to a specialist,        
       who produces a foam      
          enlargement           

248
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:03,822
     to be used as a model      
      to cast the full-size     
           sculpture.           

249
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:08,093
     the specialist places      
 the maquette on a turntable.   

250
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,097
  he spins it at an event pace  
      while scanning it.        

251
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,965
  the scanner's five cameras    

252
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,635
        take continuous         
    high-resolution photos      

253
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,970
        and upload them         
        to a computer.          

254
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:22,240
   the computer then converts   
 these photos into a 3d image.  

255
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,576
            he scans            
  the maquette several times    

256
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,445
    to make sure he captures    
         every detail.          

257
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,447
       then, he combines        
     the pictures together      

258
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:34,386
   and divides the sculpture    
        into sections.          

259
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,653
    he uses another program     

260
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,590
          to calculate          
   the scale of enlargement.    

261
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:39,858
   this helps him determine     

262
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,527
     how many and what size     
    blocks of foam he needs     

263
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,463
           to produce           
         each section.          

264
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,799
      he uses a dense foam      
       with a fine grain        

265
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:54,339
 called extruded polystyrene.   

266
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,674
           he secures           
      the foam with tape,       

267
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,877
           then uses            
   a computer-guided router     

268
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:03,048
 to carve the enlarged sections 
       of the sculpture.        

269
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,222
           the larger           
  and more detailed the part,   

270
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,692
           the longer           
      this process takes.       

271
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:19,230
   for example, this half of    
     the dog's head took 45     
            minutes,            

272
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:25,169
    while carving half a leg    
would take just eight minutes.  

273
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,706
  he uses a hot-wire machine    

274
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,643
   to slice through the block   
   and free the carved part.    

275
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,721
 the specialist removes excess  
  foam with a sanding block.    

276
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,468
     he makes sure adjacent     
            sections            
       line up properly,        

277
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,536
   then tapes them together.    

278
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:09,547
    he scrapes off the seam     
  with a horse-grooming comb,   

279
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,052
      then sands it down.       

280
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,090
       next, he measures        
         the sections           

281
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,560
   so he can cut a steel pipe   
    to the correct length.      

282
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:26,831
     the steel pipe is used     
        as a stiffener          

283
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,301
      to make the sections      
          more rigid.           

284
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:34,572
        it also connects        
  adjacent sections together.   

285
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,245
            he uses             
    a standard pipe bender      

286
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:45,917
   to match the stiffeners to   
   the sections they're going   
             into.              

287
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,720
     to embed the stiffener     
       in the dog's leg,        

288
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:51,723
       he first traces it       
    on one side of the leg,     

289
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,525
       then he carves out       
           a trough             

290
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,527
        to the depth of         
   the stiffener's diameter.    

291
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,870
  he cleans out the loose foam  
     with a narrow brush.       

292
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,407
     he checks to make sure     
    the stiffener will fit.     

293
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:21,953
  then, he applies an adhesive  
 designed especially for foam   

294
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,456
  and inserts the stiffener.    

295
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,363
    he places the other half    
      of the leg on top,        

296
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:36,701
    encasing the stiffener.     

297
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:40,104
   he leaves about six inches   
   sticking out of the leg.     

298
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,173
           he inserts           
   the protruding steel rod     

299
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:46,511
      into a hole drilled       
      in the enlargement.       

300
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,382
     once he has assembled      
       all the sections,        

301
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:55,252
     he tapes them together     
   to check their alignment.    

302
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,455
         the completed          
     sculpture enlargement      

303
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,591
   is about four times bigger   
  than the original maquette.   

304
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,595
         it's now ready         
     to be sent back to the     
           sculptor,            

305
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,863
        where he or she         
    will cover it with clay     

306
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:10,335
   and add fine details that    
 can't be reproduced in foam.   

307
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:11,936
      once this is done,        

308
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,473
       the sculptor sends       
    the clay model to a mold    
             maker,             

309
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,877
        who casts a mold        
     and sends it to a metal    
            foundry             

310
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,147
           to create            
     the final sculpture.
