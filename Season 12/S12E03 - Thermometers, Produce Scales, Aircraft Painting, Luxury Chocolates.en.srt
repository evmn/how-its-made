2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,608
      captions paid for by      
    discovery communications    

3
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:55,120
   narrator: you can sense the  
difference between hot and cold,

4
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,655
        but a thermometer       
      puts a number on it.      

5
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,391
    the concept is simple --    

6
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,593
  heat causes liquid to expand, 

7
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,731
  forcing it up a glass column  
  with a scale attached to it.  

8
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,502
     italy's galileo came up    
     with the idea in 1593.     

9
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,142
           incredibly,          
 these century-old thermometers 

10
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,144
 can still tell the temperature.

11
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:23,081
       but modern versions      
     are a bit more precise.    

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,985
     to make one, they clamp    
  glass tubing onto a carousel. 

13
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:33,625
    as it spins, torches heat   
 the center of the hollow glass,

14
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:37,095
          while below,          
 the operator pumps air into it.

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,599
  this causes the melted glass  
           to blister.          

16
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,503
      they break the tubing     
         at the blister,        

17
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,438
       creating two tubes       
  with funnel-shaped openings.  

18
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,775
      they anchor a shorter     
  glass cylinder on a turntable 

19
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,913
     and suspend one of the     
  funnel-mouth tubes above it.  

20
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:59,651
    the tubes spin in concert   
 as torches melt them together. 

21
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,119
       the funnel ensures       

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,123
 that the melting doesn't close 
        the hollow tube.        

23
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:08,793
     another torch now aims     
   further down the cylinder.   

24
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,931
        it seals the end        
   and shapes it into a ball.   

25
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,934
        to test a sample        
     of the production run,     

26
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,137
   they heat the entire length  
         of the tubing.         

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,139
  this creates vacuum pressure  

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,942
     so that when they place    
   the open end in liquid wax,  

29
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,512
      the tubing sips it up     
          like a straw.         

30
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,282
 by watching the liquid ascend, 

31
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:32,951
      they confirm that the     
 thermometer fills as it should 

32
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,787
  and has the right dimensions. 

33
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:43,028
     next, the glass tubing     
      swirls on a carousel      

34
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,031
    as flames and forced air    
          work together         

35
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,032
    to form a longer blister.   

36
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,069
  again, they break the tubing  
         at the blister.        

37
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,240
  this blister creates openings 

38
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,376
         that allow them        
 to snake a narrow, hollow wire 

39
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,513
       through the tubing,      
    joining the two sections.   

40
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,783
 flames melt and seal the glass 
        around the wire.        

41
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,319
         this is called         
     a glass-to-metal weld,     

42
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,822
         and it creates         
  a more flexible thermometer.  

43
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,263
   they cool the welded glass   
     and wire on a conveyor.    

44
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,800
next, they turn on a vacuum pump
        for several hours       

45
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,003
 to pull the air out of the wire
           and tubing.          

46
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,606
           this draws           
     the blue liquid wax up,    

47
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:30,074
         but this time,         
        it's not a test.        

48
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,278
     the wax is a nontoxic      
     alternative to mercury     

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,014
  that will expand and contract 
   with changing temperature.   

50
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,484
   the thermometers now travel  
    through chilled alcohol,    

51
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,086
    shrinking the blue liquid   

52
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,823
     down to the closed end     
       of the thermometer.      

53
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,225
      as the tubing turns,      

54
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,829
    flames follow the top end   
      to melt and close it.     

55
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,164
        a heat gun below        

56
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,765
     then drives the liquid     
         up the tubing,         

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,501
      and the air pressure      
   creates a bubble in the end  

58
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,902
      that was just closed.     

59
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,906
     this bubble will be the    
thermometer's expansion chamber.

60
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,775
  they plunge the thermometers  
          in ice water          

61
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,245
  to calibrate the bulb liquid  
    to 32 degrees fahrenheit.   

62
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,081
     they scratch the glass     
          at that mark.         

63
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,984
     next, the thermometers     
        warm up in a bath       

64
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,954
 set at 200 degrees fahrenheit. 

65
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,160
   the blue liquid shoots up,   
 and they make another scratch. 

66
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,468
  they align the two scratches  
       in the thermometer       

67
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,536
with markings on a printed grid.

68
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,806
      the distance between      
 the two scratches often varies,

69
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,075
     so by measuring against    
           this grid,           

70
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,478
       they can calibrate       
        the thermometer.        

71
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:47,286
 they then match the thermometer
  with the corresponding scale. 

72
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,090
  they install the top section  
  of the thermometer in a case  

73
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,693
 which can be metal or plastic. 

74
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,097
        they then choose        
      the appropriate scale     

75
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,634
      and slide it between      
   the glass tubing and case.   

76
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,037
   they wrap part of the wire   
    capillary around a joint    

77
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,739
        and then cap it.        

78
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,178
         the sensor bulb        
of this thermometer will be used

79
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,447
    to gauge the temperature    
    inside industrial piping.   

80
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,716
       so they protect it       
       with a metal sleeve      

81
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,251
     called a bulb chamber.     

82
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,387
  a glass window slides easily  

83
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,190
 into the grooves of the casing.

84
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,126
          a plastic cap         
     is the finishing touch.    

85
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,266
   and now these thermometers   
       are ready to gauge       

86
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,135
       the highs and lows       
    of industrial processing,   

87
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:41,106
        and they're sure        
 to measure up to expectations. 

88
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,084
 narrator: much of what you buy 
    in the produce department   

89
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,753
       of your supermarket      
       is sold by weight.       

90
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,622
   so the store usually hangs   
 a scale at the end of the aisle

91
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,557
     on which you can weigh     
          your purchase         

92
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,493
       before heading off       
        to the checkout.        

93
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,294
        this is typically       
         a type of scale        

94
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,696
  with fairly simple mechanics. 

95
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,764
 internal springs spin a pointer

96
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,334
   to the correct weight mark   
           on a dial.           

97
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,440
      the weight of produce     
       hanging in the pan       

98
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,176
   pulls on a pair of springs   
        inside the scale.       

99
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,780
 they move the various internal 
components that turn the pointer

100
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,916
to the corresponding weight mark
          on the dial.          

101
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,651
   to make the scale's frame,   

102
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,321
  a press stamps a steel plate  
           five times,          

103
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,857
      progressively cutting     
         and bending it         

104
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,727
   into the final frame shape.  

105
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,663
          a washer goes         
     into each steel spring.    

106
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,599
     they turn it up or down    
 to adjust the spring's tension.

107
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,337
  that's how they'll calibrate  
        the scale later.        

108
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,673
   the top part of each spring  
     will bolt to the frame,    

109
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,276
       and the bottom part      
        to this slider --       

110
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:54,246
     a long metal component     
     with weight markings.      

111
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,485
  next, they attach a component 
          called a rack         

112
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,220
    to one end of the slider,   

113
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,824
   securing the screw tightly   
   with thread-locking fluid.   

114
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,832
 the rack's teeth will mesh with
  this pinion gear and turn it. 

115
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,302
      they install one end      
  of the pinion into the frame. 

116
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,638
       then they screw on       
         a metal bridge         

117
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,440
    to support the other end.   

118
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,176
     they insert the slider     

119
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,112
     with the rack attached     
       through the bridge.      

120
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,682
now when you pull on the slider,
        the pinion turns.       

121
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,321
  next, they attach the springs 
    to the frame and slider.    

122
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,790
           each spring          
     in this imperial scale     

123
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,059
    supports up to 20 pounds,   

124
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,928
  making this a 40-pound scale. 

125
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,130
           when weight          
      pulls on the springs,     

126
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,032
       they move the rack,      
     which turns the pinion,    

127
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,069
          which rotates         
      the scale's pointer.      

128
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,673
a press stamps out the dial face
       from a steel plate.      

129
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,277
    after painting it white,    

130
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,048
   they print on the markings   
   with a silk-screen press.    

131
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,751
      they insert a spring      

132
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,354
       to prevent the rack      
  from slipping on the pinion.  

133
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,358
     then they put the face     
         over the bridge        

134
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,762
  so that the pinion protrudes  
  through a hole in the middle. 

135
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,164
    a guide helps them align    
            the face            

136
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,767
    so that the zero will be    
       in the right spot.       

137
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:27,238
  then they tighten two screws  
       to attach the face.      

138
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,909
   a press stamps the pointer   
 from a thin sheet of aluminum. 

139
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,313
      using a special tool,     
       they twist the end,      

140
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:39,050
       forming a thin tip       
that won't obscure the fine line

141
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,320
to which the pointer's pointing.

142
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,862
    next, a coat of red paint   
  so the pointer will stand out 

143
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,765
             against            
    the black-and-white face.   

144
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,203
      once the paint's dry,     

145
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,206
     they mallet the pointer    
        onto the pinion.        

146
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,875
      now they hang the pan     
          on the scale          

147
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,077
     and turn a little screw    
          in the slider         

148
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,013
 to adjust the pointer to zero. 

149
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,483
     this ensures the scale     
   will weigh just the produce  

150
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,019
     rather than the produce    
          and the pan.          

151
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,957
  now they calibrate the scale. 

152
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,960
    to do this, they load it    
 with weights to full capacity, 

153
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,330
       which is 40 pounds       
         for this scale.        

154
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,571
 if the pointer doesn't indicate
     40 pounds on the nose,     

155
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,840
      they turn the washer      
         in each spring         

156
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,309
    to adjust the resistance.   

157
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,450
  then they adjust the pointer  
       back to zero again.      

158
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,728
     this is what they call     
      a double-dial scale,      

159
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,131
      meaning it has a face     
    and pointer on each side.   

160
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,336
 they install the second dial on
 the opposite end of the pinion 

161
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,439
    so that the two pointers    
         move in unison.        

162
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,008
     they close up the space    
      between the two dials     

163
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,278
 with a strip of white plastic. 

164
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,480
 this sash ring, as it's called,

165
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,148
    has grooves for the dials   

166
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,152
 and for the transparent plastic
   cover that goes over them.   

167
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,223
  hanging scales can have dials 
      or digital readouts,      

168
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,159
          and they come         
 in a wide range of capacities, 

169
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,696
   from your common 20-pound,   
 or 10-kilogram, grocery model, 

170
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:36,634
    to heavy-duty 600-pound,    
       or 272-kilo, scales      

171
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,438
  designed to pull their weight 
          in industry.          

172
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,850
            narrator:           
 the stresses of flight are hard
   on an aircraft's paint job.  

173
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,453
      ice, rain, and other      
      environmental factors     

174
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,255
    can soon make an aircraft   
       look travel-weary.       

175
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,792
       regular paint jobs       
       are just the ticket      

176
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,661
          when it comes         
   to keeping up appearances.   

177
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,032
     they also help maintain    
 the integrity of the airframe. 

178
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,673
    problems may lurk beneath   
  the old paint of an aircraft. 

179
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:19,744
   stripping it off can expose  
weaknesses in the aluminum skin.

180
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,647
          they brush on         
  a powerful chemical solution. 

181
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,950
     the paint bubbles off,     

182
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,921
     baring the aluminum and    
 any small holes or dents in it.

183
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,092
 they seal the windows and doors

184
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,962
  and wrap sensitive components 
          like antennas         

185
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:41,266
to protect them during stripping
        and pre-painting.       

186
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,775
       back to those flaws      
    on the exposed aluminum.    

187
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,243
      a production manager      

188
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,447
  flags any damage or corrosion 
         with blue tape.        

189
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,653
     a technician then mixes    
 a two-part aerodynamic filler. 

190
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,922
        he works quickly        

191
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,992
because the compound will harden
           in minutes.          

192
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,395
      he spreads the filler     
         on the defects         

193
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,532
           flagged by           
     the production manager.    

194
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:18,402
    the repair job smoothes     
    the surface for painting    

195
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,607
     and makes the airframe     
 stronger and more aerodynamic. 

196
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,879
  this aircraft has been primed 
           and sanded.          

197
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,016
    now technicians blow off    
          all the dust.         

198
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,425
     they also wipe it down     
     with adhesive cloths.      

199
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,695
     this intensive cleaning    
           is crucial.          

200
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,096
            the plane           
     has to be squeaky-clean    

201
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,500
          or the paint          
     won't adhere properly.     

202
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,173
       next, they prepare       
      an additional primer.     

203
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,710
     they spray it on areas     
     that need more coverage    

204
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,714
        and around parts        
  that will get a lot of wear.  

205
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:10,054
they then mix polyurethane paint

206
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,258
     with various catalysts     
         and activators.        

207
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,593
 it's a special aircraft blend. 

208
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,062
    jets can be jumbo-sized,    
           of course,           

209
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,332
  so they often prep and paint  
      a section at a time,      

210
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,200
  sometimes on different days.  

211
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,003
       they're now working      
    on the fuselage and tail.   

212
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,737
 respirators and full-body gear 

213
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,140
          protect them          
    from the hazardous fumes    

214
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,943
    as they work from the top   
      of the aircraft down.     

215
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,879
a warm, low-humidity environment
          is essential          

216
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,348
       to allow the paint       
       to cure properly.        

217
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,684
       and they'll adjust       
       the paint formula        

218
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,654
          to compensate         
 when conditions aren't optimal.

219
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,427
    an aircraft usually gets    
       two to three coats,      

220
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,797
          resulting in          
      a high-gloss finish.      

221
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,438
         while it dries,        

222
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,040
    a technician demonstrates   
         for our camera         

223
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,043
 the process of painting stripes
        onto an aircraft.       

224
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,713
  he maps out the paint scheme  
           with tape,           

225
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,715
   then peels away some of it.  

226
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:18,323
         he spray-paints        
      the exposed sections.     

227
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,991
     he peels off more tape     

228
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,861
         and then covers        
   the freshly painted stripes  

229
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,395
      with protective paper     

230
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,465
  so he can spray another color 
         onto the plane.        

231
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,670
          he pulls back         
    the final pieces of tape,   

232
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,007
       and this job passes      
       with flying colors.      

233
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,880
 they do some final detail work 

234
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,017
     to make sure the lines     
      are clean and crisp.      

235
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,952
  after all, appearances count  

236
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,222
    in the high-flying world    
    of international travel.    

237
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,967
  even very tiny imperfections  
       won't be tolerated.      

238
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,704
   using fine-grit sandpaper,   
   they make them disappear.    

239
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,308
     it can take four weeks     
     and 1,800 person-hours     

240
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,911
     to repaint a large jet.    

241
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:19,650
   and when it comes to price,  
      the sky's the limit.      

242
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,121
  the least expensive jobs cost 
  tens of thousands of dollars. 

243
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,325
         so the customer        
       has the final say.       

244
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,460
       the handshake means      

245
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:34,432
  this plane is ready to model  
  its new look on the runway.   

246
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,814
            narrator:           
  bite into a luxury chocolate, 

247
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,549
  and you'll get a taste of one 
  of the finer things in life.  

248
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,086
    each one tastes different   
         from the next,         

249
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,422
      and it's that element     
           of surprise          

250
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,690
          that keeps us         
      coming back for more.     

251
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,894
   of course you could consult  
      the index on the box,     

252
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,996
  but that would spoil the fun. 

253
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,170
      ever since chocolate      
         was discovered,        

254
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,372
         people have had        
        a craving for it.       

255
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,175
    today's luxury chocolates   
       take our addiction       

256
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:20,244
      to a whole new level.     

257
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:24,382
   they add marshmallow cream   
     and lots of pure butter    

258
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,183
to a mix of sugar and corn syrup

259
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,553
           to whip up           
  some buttercream chocolates.  

260
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,791
         water, vanilla,        
   and a special yeast enzyme   

261
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,459
      complete the recipe.      

262
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,696
     the enzyme will enhance    
         the creaminess.        

263
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,535
    they tuck the buttercream   
     between ridged rollers,    

264
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,205
         which shape it         
      into creamy columns.      

265
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:51,642
       a wire slices them       
    into bite-sized morsels.    

266
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,686
   they tamp the buttercreams   
      to a uniform height.      

267
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,758
   chocolate oozes up through   
   the slats of this conveyor   

268
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,093
       to coat the bottoms      
         of the creams.         

269
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:13,097
          then it's on          
 to a cool surface to solidify. 

270
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,568
 next, the creams travel through
    two curtains of chocolate   

271
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,405
       while being coated       
      on the bottoms again.     

272
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,912
    a worker uses her fingers   
  to make a symbol on the top.  

273
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,450
it's a clue as to what's inside.

274
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:36,053
        a trip through a        
 24 1/2-foot-long cooling tunnel

275
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,590
     hardens the chocolate,     
 and it's a feast for the eyes. 

276
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,525
 you can look, but don't taste. 

277
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,263
        these chocolates        
  are headed to the stockroom.  

278
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:48,866
         now production         
       takes a sweet turn       

279
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,335
         as they cook up        
       a caramel filling.       

280
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,671
     they add sugar and salt    
            to water,           

281
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,908
     followed by corn syrup     
    and a lot of heavy cream.   

282
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,782
     they fire up the burner    
     and turn on the mixer.     

283
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,619
   they add butter to enhance   
           the flavor.          

284
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,355
           as the mix           
    comes to a bubbling boil,   

285
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,091
         it caramelizes.        

286
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,093
    then they kill the heat.    

287
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,263
 otherwise, the next ingredient,
 pure vanilla, would evaporate. 

288
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,772
 they apply a nonstick substance
          to a big pan,         

289
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,610
 then pour the caramel into it. 

290
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,917
 they leave it to set overnight.

291
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,888
    the next day, they divide   
 the caramel slab into squares. 

292
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,733
  they feed the caramel squares 

293
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,269
          into a device         
      with circular knives.     

294
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,471
   it's called a gang cutter,   

295
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,140
    and it slices the squares   
          into strips.          

296
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,410
            they turn           
   the sliced square sideways,  

297
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,279
           and it goes          
  through the gang cutter again 

298
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,548
    to create caramel cubes.    

299
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,285
     they dust the caramels     
           with starch          

300
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,554
       so they won't stick      
          to each other         

301
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,123
       as they go through       
  the chocolate-coating system. 

302
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,966
     and that's how they get    
  the caramel in the chocolate. 

303
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,569
             to make            
   cordial-cherry chocolates,   

304
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,972
     they load the cherries     
     into a revolving pan.      

305
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,843
    they add sugar crystals,    
and as the cherries roll around,

306
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,012
    they get an even coating.   

307
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,116
      along with the sugar,     

308
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,186
 these cherries have been coated
     with a special enzyme.     

309
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,456
it will turn the sugar to liquid
      over the next 10 days     

310
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,058
   for a juicer cherry taste.   

311
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,195
        the enzyme effect       

312
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,130
     is why the cherries get    
 an extra coating of chocolate. 

313
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,368
    it creates a solid shell    
that contains the sugary liquid.

314
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,477
      and now they're ready     
 for cherry-picking chocoholics.

315
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,083
 each box of chocolates contains
  18 to 20 different varieties. 

316
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,353
         since they make        
  three to four flavors a day,  

317
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,954
    it can take up to a week    

318
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,791
     to produce one of these    
       luxury assortments.      

319
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,629
 of course, they'll be devoured 
       in no time at all.       

320
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:35,633
        for the customer,       
      it's one sweet deal.
