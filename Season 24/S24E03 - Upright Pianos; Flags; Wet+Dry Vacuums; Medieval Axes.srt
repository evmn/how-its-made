    discovery communications

00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,586
 narrator: unlike a grand piano,
  an upright piano is vertical, 

4
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,790
      so you can place it       
        against a wall.         

5
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,991
         uprights come          
      in various heights.       

6
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,063
  the taller ones have longer   
strings and a larger soundboard,

7
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,433
so their sound is closer to that
       of a grand piano.        

8
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,938
     around four feet tall,     

9
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,843
  this is the largest upright   
      piano on the market.      

10
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,612
    it's designed for those     
  who lack the budget or space  

11
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,481
       of a grand piano.        

12
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,752
       a piano technician       

13
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,557
spends several days calibrating 
the pre-assembled action stack. 

14
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,694
    it has 88 wooden hammers    
  with heads wrapped in felt.   

15
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,229
      pressing a piano key      

16
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:41,567
 causes the corresponding hammer
 to strike a particular string. 

17
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,638
 the string vibrates, producing 
    a specific musical note.    

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,109
   a damper stops the string    
vibration a split second later, 

19
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,310
       ending the sound.        

20
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,647
     each key has two slots     
        called mortises.        

21
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,516
         they are lined         
      with a felt bushing       

22
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,785
 to protect the wood from wear. 

23
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,052
    at the back of each key,    

24
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,056
there's a height adjustment rod 
       called a capstan.        

25
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:06,525
 each key has an embedded lead  
             disc.              

26
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,593
this disc equalizes the pressure

27
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,996
         that's needed          
   to play an individual key.   

28
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,332
     without this pressure      
         equalization,          

29
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,402
         you would have         
to press harder on the bass keys

30
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,536
   because their hammers and    

31
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,239
      strings are heavier.      

32
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,211
   the soundboard is already    
 installed in the piano cabinet 

33
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,814
    under a cast iron frame.    

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,082
     the technician checks      

35
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,619
         the clearance          
 between soundboard components. 

36
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,020
           he verifies          
     that each steel string     

37
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,890
        is properly wound       
   to a tuning pin at the top,  

38
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,626
     loops over a hitch pin     
         at the bottom,         

39
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,363
and passes over a wooden bridge 
          in between.           

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,566
          after making          
     necessary adjustments,     

41
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:52,037
    he measures the pressure    
of each string over the bridge, 

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,574
       a critical factor        
      producing fine tone.

         [ notes play ]         

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,212
 then he tunes below the bridge,

45
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,714
    adjusting string tension    
           as needed.

         [ notes play ]         

47
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,327
         the technician         
     assembles the keyboard     

48
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,130
      by aligning each key      
    with corresponding pins     

49
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,531
       on the key frame.        

50
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,735
  he uses round spacers called  
  punchings to equalize height  

51
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,205
  so the black and white keys   
           are level.           

52
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,346
    he checks the tightness     
    of each key's bushings.     

53
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,415
 if a key needs to be loosened, 

54
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,585
   he compresses the bushing    
    and widens the mortise.     

55
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,090
        then he installs        
        the action stack        

56
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,891
  directly above the keyboard,  

57
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:52,163
      attaching it to bolts     
 mounted on the cast iron frame.

58
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,299
 he presses each key a few times

59
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,235
          to make sure          
     it functions properly.     

60
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,370
         if it doesn't,         

61
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,540
     he adjusts the capstan     
    to better strike the key.   

62
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,515
   then he connects the pedals  
 to the components they control.

63
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,716
         the right pedal        

64
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,919
        pulls the dampers       
      away from the strings     

65
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,855
   to let the sound continue.   

66
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,725
the left pedal draws the hammers
     closer to the strings,     

67
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,928
    which reduces the volume    
          of the sound.         

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,397
        then several more       
         calibrations --        

69
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,333
          each hammer           
 to make sure it moves correct, 

70
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,600
         each backcheck         

71
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,404
   so that it doesn't rebound   
        and strike again.       

72
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,475
     and finally, each key      

73
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,678
      is checked to ensure      
    that the pressing depth     

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,413
          is identical          
      across the keyboard.      

75
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,949
   if a key needs adjustment,   

76
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,818
 he adds or removes punchings.  

77
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,353
      they come in a range      

78
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,057
 of thicknesses from heavy felt 
  to ultra-thin tissue paper.   

79
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,363
    he plays with different     
combinations until the pressing 

80
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,132
       depth is perfect.

         [ note plays ]         

82
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,638
  now he strikes a tuning fork  
         to sound an "a"        

83
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,509
            and tunes           
   the corresponding "a" key.   

84
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,180
then he tunes all the other keys
   in relation to that note,    

85
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,850
    tweaking each tuning pin    
     with a special wrench.

an assembler completes the piano

88
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,260
    by mounting the remaining   
    sections of the cabinet.    

89
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,531
      this cabinet is made      
     of wood and laminates,     

90
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,802
      coated in high-gloss      
       polyester resin --       

91
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,270
 an elegant yet simple exterior,

92
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,574
     enclosing very complex     
       internal workings.

 flags bring strangers together 
 to support a cause or a nation.

94
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:04,228
   for many centuries, a flag   
 fluttering above the fighting  

95
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,497
          was a visible         
      communication signal.     

96
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,033
        flags eventually        
    became patriotic symbols    

97
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,036
   away from the battlefield.   

98
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,440
and today there is one for every
country and almost every cause. 

99
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:23,882
 flags bring strangers together 
 to support a cause or a nation.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
    rippling in the breeze,     

101
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,991
   flags have a kinetic energy  
   that draws people to them.   

102
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,928
at this factory, they make flags
    from special polyester.     

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,397
       it's extra strong,       

104
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,999
   but it's also translucent    
       to make the design       

105
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,868
    visible from both sides.    

106
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,670
  a machine unwinds the fabric  

107
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:50,007
          over rollers          
that pull it straight and tight.

108
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,043
         it then enters         
       a digital printer.       

109
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,549
    the first printing head     
      lays down the image       

110
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,551
  and a second one deepens it.  

111
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,424
     printing in two steps      
  keeps the dyes from running.  

112
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,229
          the employee          
  transfers the printed fabric  

113
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,798
      to the next machine.      

114
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,337
   he loops it through guide    
  rollers and secures the end.  

115
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,442
   the flag material travels    

116
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:30,248
     over a larger cylinder     
 that's heated to 419 degrees.  

117
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,819
 this bakes or fixates the dye  
        into the fabric.        

118
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,328
       at the wash line,        

119
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,132
    a worker aligns the flag    
 with a sheet of leader fabric  

120
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,700
       and trims the end.       

121
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,811
        a sewing machine        
 stitches the fabrics together  

122
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,147
 in a chain lock configuration. 

123
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,418
    this seam is tough enough   

124
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,188
      to withstand a series     
         of wash cycles.        

125
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,566
         the first wash         
     removes any excess dye     

126
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,302
      that wasn't fixated       
         on the fabric.         

127
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,705
   they add special chemicals   
          to this wash          

128
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,574
     because ordinary soap      
      isn't strong enough.      

129
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,980
        the second bath         
       contains chemicals       

130
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,985
         that neutralize        
    the cleaning substances.    

131
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,854
       finally, the fabric      
 travels through a rinse station

132
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,323
           to remove            
    the residual chemicals.     

133
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,796
      pressurized rollers       
      wring out the water.      

134
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,933
    the damp fabric travels     
 over steamed heated cylinders  

135
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,135
 that dry and iron the fabric.  

136
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,811
        the flag material       
      winds around rollers      

137
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,014
         before reaching        
       the cutting table.       

138
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,419
   the worker first cuts out    

139
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,455
     the color code printed     
   on the side of the fabric.   

140
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,762
     she uses a spectrometer    

141
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,830
           to confirm           
   that the colors are correct  

142
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,199
        and haven't faded       
        during the wash.        

143
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,769
   then she cuts out the flags  

144
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,573
          using a pair          
     of industrial scissors.    

145
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,379
the polyester material is strong

146
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,583
  and doesn't unravel or fray   
      during the cutting.       

147
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,063
    the next worker stitches    
    a sleeve onto the fabric    

148
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,831
    for the banner hardware.    

149
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,306
          she also hems         
     the other three sides.     

150
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,486
  at another station, a machine 
 installs a grommet on the front

151
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,891
    and a washer on the back    
       to make an eyelet.       

152
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,361
      an employee inserts       
 a fiberglass rod in the sleeve 

153
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,998
   and threads a bungee cord    
      through the eyelet.       

154
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,036
      he inspects the fit       

155
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:42,907
   and confirms that the flag   
  will withstand strong winds.  

156
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,176
 from conception to completion, 

157
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,913
   it takes about three days    
     to manufacture flags.      

158
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,850
    then the sky's the limit.   

159
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,864
 narrator: you can use a wet/dry
   vacuum both inside and out,  

160
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:06,998
       to clean up messes       

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,534
    that an ordinary cleaner    
          can't handle.         

162
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,203
   this powerful picker-upper   
     can suction everything     

163
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,473
          from leaves           
    to small pieces of wood,    

164
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,009
and if you remove the filter bag
         from the tank,         

165
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,211
   it can vacuum liquids, too.  

166
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,550
a wet/dry vacuum is lightweight,

167
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,552
         yet can handle         
       heavy-duty pickups       

168
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,321
        that would ruin         
  an ordinary vacuum cleaner.   

169
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,694
     most of the components     
          are plastic.          

170
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,029
   this machine produces them   

171
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,832
   by shooting molten plastic   
           into molds,          

172
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,835
        then cooling it         
       to a solid state.        

173
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,671
            a robot             
  extracts the finished parts.  

174
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,909
     all the vacuum's parts     

175
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,946
      are injection-molded      
 except for the electric motor. 

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,185
    the motor has two fans.     

177
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,521
   one cools the motor itself   
        with ambient air        

178
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:08,460
 and the other creates a vacuum 
to suck debris through the hose.

179
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,129
         the vacuum fan         
    is in a separate chamber    

180
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,231
      so that liquid never      
        comes in contact        

181
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,801
        with the motor's        
     electrical components.     

182
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,871
     workers place the motor    
      in a plastic housing      

183
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,607
      with the drive shaft      
         facing upward.         

184
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,877
 they put a spacer on the shaft,

185
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,615
   then mount the vacuum fan,   
    securing it with a nut.     

186
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,955
   they close up the housing    
       with a grid plate.       

187
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:40,525
   this prevents fingers from   
 accidentally touching the fan. 

188
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,870
 they now take the head assembly
       to a testing area.       

189
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,441
     they'll run the motor      
      for up to 10 minutes      

190
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,245
    to make sure everything     
      functions correctly.      

191
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,388
       then they plug it        
  into a second test station,   

192
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,257
         which verifies         
 that there's adequate suction  

193
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,693
        and no electrical       
         short circuits.        

194
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,201
    if everything checks out,   

195
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,872
  they send the head assembly   
     to the packaging area.     

196
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,042
     there, workers assemble    
     the rest of the vacuum.    

197
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,350
      at the first station,     

198
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,219
a press locks the inlet securely

199
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,321
            in a hole           
    at the front of the tank.   

200
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,960
   at the next stop, a worker   
   places a package of screws,  

201
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,963
     an instruction manual,     
        and four casters        

202
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:56,034
to be installed by the purchaser
          in the tank.          

203
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,770
         next, workers          
     take the head assembly     

204
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,105
           and add it           
     to the vac's top cover.    

205
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,246
   they load the vacuum's lid   

206
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:13,851
     onto a carousel along      
  with a pleated paper filter.  

207
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,120
    the filter prevents dust    
         and fine debris        

208
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:20,658
          from getting          
  into the vacuum fan chamber.  

209
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,459
         then they mount        
        the head assembly       

210
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,596
         on an automated        
      screw-driving machine     

211
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,131
    and place the lid on top    

212
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,834
      after first removing      
           the filter.          

213
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,943
    once the lid is screwed     
     to the head assembly,      

214
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,145
  they put the filter back on.  

215
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,527
now they place the assembled lid
        onto the tank...        

216
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,667
  ...and snap down the latches  
          to secure it.         

217
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,907
   the final stop on the line   

218
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,111
    checks the suction power,   
     the electrical system,     

219
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,180
and makes sure the on/off switch
        works correctly.        

220
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,586
  if the vacuum passes testing, 

221
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,991
   a robot picks up the unit    
 and places it in a retail box. 

222
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,132
  workers add extension wands,  
      a nozzle, and a hose,     

223
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,200
   then finally a filter bag    
           is added,            

224
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,304
       which is only used       
  when vacuuming up dry debris. 

225
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,882
     consumer wet/dry vacs      
  come in several tank sizes,   

226
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,285
      from 1 to 24 gallons.     

227
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,572
  narrator: during the medieval 
 era, axes were more than tools.

228
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,240
  they were terrifying weapons  

229
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,177
       that could inflict       
       very deep wounds.        

230
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,645
        today, craftsmen        
     still make battle axes     

231
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,082
             for use            
 in the entertainment industry. 

232
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,125
     the medieval battle ax     
      was a brutal weapon.      

233
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,460
       with a single blow,      

234
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,195
     it could break through     
        a knight's armor        

235
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,531
     and fatally wound him.     

236
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,268
to produce an authentic replica 
    for movies and tv shows,    

237
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,105
     the blacksmith consults    
        reference books.        

238
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,343
 he sketches the ax head design 
           on paper,            

239
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,646
    roughing out the details    
     to the desired scale.      

240
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,553
      he cleans up pieces       
      of old carbon steel,      

241
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,056
      which he'll combine       
       with other metals.       

242
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,532
in total, there will be 75 metal
 strips of varying composition. 

243
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,702
 to complete the mix of metals, 

244
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,906
      he cuts an old blade      
   made of nickel steel alloy   

245
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,443
   into equally sized strips.   

246
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,713
 he loads 37 strips into a vice.

247
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,586
      he tightens the vice      
 and tack-welds them together.  

248
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,725
   he sands the welded stack.   

249
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,528
   he rubs oil into the stack   
     to prevent oxidation.      

250
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,167
  now, exposed to intense heat, 
the metal layers forge together.

251
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,405
    he spreads a mix of borax   
 and other minerals called flux 

252
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,607
        onto the surface.       

253
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,209
     this deters oxidation      

254
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:02,679
    as the forging continues    
    with a pneumatic hammer.    

255
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,148
  the hammer slams the layers   

256
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,152
       together to become       
    a solid laminated block.    

257
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:12,223
  it's ready to be transformed  
  into the ax's cutting head.   

258
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,693
repeated strikes pinch the metal
         in the center.         

259
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,361
 he sprinkles the flux mixture  

260
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:21,031
       onto the surface of      
 the metal form, heats it again,

261
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,702
 and folds it into a "c" shape. 

262
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,036
        after a reheat,         

263
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,773
       he inserts a layer       
 of carbon steel in the center  

264
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,974
         for the blade.         

265
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:32,309
 he hammers the "c" shape flat, 

266
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,213
   leaving the pinched section  
      round for the handle.     

267
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,653
         the 75 strips          
   have been forged into one.   

268
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:49,994
     next, the power hammer     
    refines the handle knob.    

269
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,063
     he drives a steel stake    
     called a tapered drift     

270
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,998
  into the center of the knob.  

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,203
     this forms an opening      
 for inserting the wood handle. 

272
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,004
    using the power hammer,     

273
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:06,544
 he now flattens the blade end  
 of the ax head substantially.  

274
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,146
          he flares it          
     to form a cutting edge     

275
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,083
     and removes the excess     
     with a plasma cutter.      

276
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,153
         he saws it off,        

277
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,423
    and the result is fierce.   

278
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,225
  the ax head has taken shape,  

279
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,695
   but it needs some refining.  

280
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,698
   he hammers the handle area   
      to spread it wider.       

281
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,772
 and dips the ax head in water  
        to cool it down.        

282
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:39,510
then he grinds the blade thinner
       using a belt sander      

283
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,647
   and rinses off the residue.  

284
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,316
       he grinds it again       
 to get rid of any hammer marks 

285
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,251
      or oxidative scale.       

286
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,458
      the different metals      
   react when dipped in acid,   

287
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,397
   creating a swirled pattern   
  on the surface of the head.   

288
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,534
the first bath was contaminated,
      so he polishes it off     

289
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:08,472
     and gives the ax head      
  another rinse in clean acid.  

290
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,540
      after heat treating       
         and tempering,         

291
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,880
 he polishes the face of the ax 
       and hones the edge.      

292
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,349
 next, he grinds spiral grooves 

293
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,018
      into a piece of oak       
      for the ax's handle.      

294
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,022
       a colleague stains       

295
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,426
       the entire handle        
to accentuate the carved spirals

296
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,361
     and enhance the grain      
          of the wood.          

297
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,763
         once it dries,         

298
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,033
  the blacksmith wedges the ax  
     head onto the handle.      

299
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:41,371
      a few strikes against     
 a steel block improves the fit.

300
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,841
 finally, he hammers upholstery 
      studs onto the handle     

301
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,043
     to simulate the rivets     

302
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:51,716
  that reinforced the original  
      medieval ax handles.      

303
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:56,387
        this medieval ax        
      is ready for action.      

304
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,722
      medieval ax replicas      

305
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,058
       are authentic props      
    for any tv show or movie.   

306
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,962
       handled carefully,       
      no one will get hurt.     

307
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,006
    if you have any comments    
         about the show,        

308
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,010
    or you'd like to suggest    
    topics for future shows,
