00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,558
narrator: today on "how it's made"...  

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,861
high-precision cutting tools...

3
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,400
...stained glass...      

4
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,705
...semi-trailers...      

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,611
...and recorders.       

6
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,788
industrial cutting tools    

7
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,924
are the metalworking components
of factory machinery.     

8
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,527
they're designed        
to form metal into product parts

9
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,064
or into devices for making product parts.   

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,736
high-tech industries use high-precision cutting tools. 

11
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,142
these are the end mills --   

12
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:22,081
tools specifically designed for cutting and shaping metal. 

13
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,016
they're made from a very durable
grade of steel         

14
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,286
or from tungsten carbide --  

15
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:30,622
a metal even stronger than steel.   

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,891
steel bars in their raw state       

17
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,828
are actually soft enough to be cut and shaped.     

18
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,030
but it takes loads of lubrication         

19
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,865
to cool the intense heat    

20
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,968
that metal-on-metal friction generates.           

21
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,836
using a giant band saw,    

22
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,972
they cut the bars into end-mill-size pieces,   

23
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,642
called blanks.         

24
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,111
workers turn each blank individually    

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,048
on a computer-guided metal lathe.          

26
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,251
first, they form a point on one end.          

27
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:03,122
then they flatten the opposite end and drill a center hole.  

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,329
then they trim the diameter to the required size.     

29
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:21,006
next stop -- a computer-guided milling machine.        

30
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,808
it works on three blanks at a time,           

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,412
carving helix-shaped ridges called flutes.         

32
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,449
the flutes run almost the full length of the blank. 

33
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,153
once again,          

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,357
lubrication is essential to prevent overheating.     

35
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,502
this milling process transforms
each blank into a tool.    

36
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,371
from this point on,      

37
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,141
the shorter, smooth portion is called the shank,      

38
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,211
the longer, fluted portion, the cutting end.        

39
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,451
here's the same milling process again     

40
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,620
but for a different model.   

41
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,937
here are both models before and after.       

42
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,805
now they cure the steel    

43
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,276
using a two-step heat-treatment process.    

44
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,479
the first stage hardens the metal, using molten salt --

45
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,949
salt that's been heated until it liquefies.      

46
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,753
they soak the tools in five  
progressively hotter salt baths,

47
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,554
whose temperatures range    

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,293
from 1,200 to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit.          

49
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,962
the second phase of heat treatment       

50
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,498
is a process called induction. 

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,768
they set each tool into a large metal coil.    

52
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,839
the coil's internal magnetic field generates intense heat, 

53
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,843
which softens the shank, making it more flexible.    

54
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,712
now the finishing process.   

55
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,648
they run the shank against a grinding wheel,   

56
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,251
whose grit is made of diamond particles.     

57
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,187
this gives it the strength to erode steel         

58
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,723
with a high degree of precision.

59
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,027
they verify the final diameter using a digital micrometer.  

60
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,868
then a robotic arm runs the tools -- one at a time -- 

61
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,271
through a high-precision automated grinding machine,  

62
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,674
this time to finish the cutting end.        

63
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,010
the machine uses diamond grinding wheels    

64
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,145
to grind the precise cutting angles         

65
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,748
and finalize the diameter.   

66
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,417
more complex tools       

67
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,220
go into this even more sophisticated grinding machine.

68
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,425
it, too, uses diamond wheels and runs robotically.     

69
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,564
the end mills are now completed.

70
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,700
this factory makes high-precision cutting tools, 

71
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,904
primarily for the aerospace and automotive industries,   

72
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,774
where precision is everything. 

73
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,910
so at each stage of the production process,   

74
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,045
the factory verifies measurements          

75
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,316
using various optical and digital instruments.    

76
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,255
this sensing probe conducts the final quality-control test.

77
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,191
it scans each and every finished end mill       

78
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,862
to ensure that the surface is as smooth as silk.     

79
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,398
these high-precision cutting tools         

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,003
are now ready to be put to work
machining aluminum, titanium, 

81
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,506
and different types of steel. 

82
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,282
narrator: around 1,000 a.d.,       

83
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:53,151
craftsmen began making intricate window designs    

84
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,687
using lead -- rather than wood or plaster -- 

85
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,156
between pieces of colored glass.

86
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,959
before long, the church began commissioning      

87
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,363
stained-glass windows depicting religious scenes   

88
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,032
to adorn the great cathedrals of europe.           

89
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,570
you can make stained glass two ways --          

90
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,038
using copper foil,       

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,708
a technique developed about 100 years ago      

92
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,912
by the american artist louis comfort tiffany,     

93
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,716
or you can use the centuries-old
european lead technique,    

94
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,185
which we're about to see.   

95
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,922
first, the artist lays a plate of glass over a pattern    

96
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,858
and traces the parts of the design         

97
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,994
that she'll cut from that plate.

98
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:40,999
then she scores her trace line using a glass cutter.     

99
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,336
a quick snap, and the glass separates neatly.       

100
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,938
she follows the same procedure 

101
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,541
with different colors and textures of glass,     

102
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,511
making all the pieces of the design.         

103
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,220
by running the cutter slightly inside the trace line,

104
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,822
she leaves room for the strip of lead     

105
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,026
that will later hold the pieces of glass together. 

106
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,033
once she finishes cutting all the pieces,        

107
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,302
she checks them against the pattern,          

108
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:20,405
making sure they'll fit together properly. 

109
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,317
now it's time to assemble the pieces,    

110
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,186
using the pattern as a guide. 

111
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,988
this zinc molding will frame the panel,     

112
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,324
its inner groove fitting over the edge of the glass.  

113
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,129
the artist positions this molding     

114
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,398
along the perimeter of the pattern.        

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,135
then she drills an l-shaped wood frame into the worktable 

116
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,806
to hold everything in place during assembly.        

117
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,411
a few nails keep the molding in place.           

118
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,680
she'll join the pieces of glass
using strips of lead,     

119
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,415
called came.          

120
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,951
lead is used because it's soft enough to bend    

121
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,354
to the shape of the pieces.  

122
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,890
after straightening out a long strip of came,     

123
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,093
she cuts the various lengths she needs           

124
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,395
to border each piece of glass. 

125
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,766
the came is shaped in such a way

126
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:26,771
that the glass on each side just slides right under.    

127
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,374
the cutting pliers, called nippers,        

128
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,509
are specially designed to slice through the came   

129
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,944
without deforming it.     

130
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,864
once the artist finishes assembling the glass pieces,  

131
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,268
she pushes everything gently against the wood frame.    

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,137
this squares the panel     

133
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:03,008
and ensures the pieces fit together snugly.      

134
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,878
now she brushes on flux, a type of acid.        

135
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,813
this cleans the lead came   

136
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,883
so that the solder will adhere well.        

137
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,551
using a soldering iron,    

138
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,288
she applies a bead of lead-and-tin solder     

139
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,924
wherever two strips of lead meet.         

140
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,762
then she uses a short-bristled brush     

141
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:27,098
to coat the lead in black putty.

142
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,966
this makes the seams watertight

143
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,036
and gives the lead a darker, aged look.      

144
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,773
finally, she sprinkles on calcium chloride powder,  

145
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,242
called whiting.        

146
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,312
this sets the putty and polishes
the glass and lead to a shine. 

147
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,951
after four painstaking hours, the panel is finished.     

148
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,921
more elaborate stained-glass works      

149
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,856
feature hand-painted detailing.

150
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,593
the artist first prepares the design on paper,      

151
00:09:55,595 --> 00:10:00,264
then cuts the pieces of glass accordingly.          

152
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,668
he paints the design outline on the pieces in black,    

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,004
then fires them in a kiln to set the paint.       

154
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,341
to create shading, he applies a coat of brown paint     

155
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,477
called grisaille.       

156
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,813
using a dry brush,       

157
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,549
he removes it from the parts he wants to highlight.     

158
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,817
then he fires the glass again. 

159
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,486
now he paints in the fine details        

160
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,956
and fires the glass for one last time.       

161
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,093
the paint contains powdered glass,        

162
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:32,964
so the intense heat of the kiln
bonds it to the glass pieces. 

163
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,035
the result is nothing short of spectacular.        

164
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:47,445
narrator: for those of you who flunked truck anatomy 101, 

165
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,247
here's a quick review.     

166
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,649
the front of the truck, where the driver sits,     

167
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,850
is called the cab.       

168
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,986
the back that carries the cargo is the trailer.   

169
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,389
a semi-trailer is a type of trailer      

170
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,258
whose front end goes on the same wheels       

171
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,627
as the rear end of the cab.  

172
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,734
this type of semi-trailer is called a van.        

173
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,071
it has a closed-in compartment for transporting cargo     

174
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,907
that needs protection from the elements.       

175
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,277
to make the coupler plate --  

176
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,147
the part that attaches the van to the truck cab --  

177
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,350
they submerge steel plates in water            

178
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,220
to quell the smoke that metal-cutting generates. 

179
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,423
they use a computer-guided plasma cutter.         

180
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,094
this powerful torch ejects hot gas at high pressure,    

181
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,264
slicing through the metal with detailed precision.    

182
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,170
elsewhere in the factory,   

183
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,372
they take prepainted aluminum panels        

184
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,709
and rivet them onto aluminum or steel support posts...   

185
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,245
the same way drywall goes onto 2x4s         

186
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,247
in house construction.     

187
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,849
these thin, lightweight panels 

188
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,918
will be the van's exterior walls.   

189
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,855
plywood on the reverse side makes up the interior walls.  

190
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,526
a computerized sensor guides the robotic drills   

191
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,595
to drive screws through the plywood,      

192
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,930
into the support posts underneath.          

193
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,466
for heated or refrigerated vans,

194
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,204
there's a layer of insulation in the walls.         

195
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,807
the floor is made of either laminated hardwood or aluminum 

196
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,943
screwed onto narrow steel beams.

197
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:30,281
after assembling the walls,  
the steel door frame, and doors,

198
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,751
workers install a steel floor plate at the doorway.  

199
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,954
this protects the floor from damage          

200
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:40,024
when truckers load and unload their cargo by forklift.

201
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:44,295
workers fold aluminum flashing over the roof's perimeter   

202
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,630
to prevent water infiltration. 

203
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:50,902
fiberglass roofing like this allows daylight into the van. 

204
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,904
aluminum roofing doesn't,   

205
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,807
so those vans sometimes have electric lighting.    

206
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:01,112
another type of semi-trailer is the flatbed --       

207
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,716
an open trailer used mostly for hauling raw materials,   

208
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,118
such as logs and pipes.    

209
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,522
heavier flatbed models are made
of thick, higher-grade steel. 

210
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,058
workers cut the bulkier parts 

211
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,728
using what's called an automatic oxy cutter.    

212
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,464
it combines two gases to create
a flame intense enough     

213
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,300
to slice right through metal. 

214
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,940
once cut, the parts have to be formed to the required shape.  

215
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,277
to do that, workers use what's called a press brake -- 

216
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,080
a machine that applies up to 330 tons of pressure --   

217
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,682
to bend the steel.       

218
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,154
they measure the result    

219
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,357
to ensure it meets design specifications.     

220
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,631
the chassis will have two main beams    

221
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,767
running the length of the flatbed.        

222
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,704
a semiautomatic robot welds together the various sections 

223
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,706
that make up each beam.    

224
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,109
a worker follows behind,    

225
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,379
inspecting the joints and removing welding residue. 

226
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,052
now they position two main beams side by side,  

227
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,520
inserting steel cross members through them          

228
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,922
to support the floor.     

229
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,726
they install the coupler plate and other components,     

230
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,329
then weld everything together. 

231
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,001
flatbeds come in extendable versions     

232
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,606
designed to accommodate loads of various lengths.      

233
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:37,675
they extend and retract on steel rollers        

234
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,246
operated by controls located inside the truck cab. 

235
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,286
with the chassis complete,   

236
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,889
they can now work on the axle assembly.     

237
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,827
semi-trailers have an air-brake system.   

238
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,962
when the driver applies the brakes,      

239
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,031
there's a release of air pressure        

240
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,565
into the brake chambers,    

241
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,301
triggering the brake shoes   

242
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,871
to bear down on the brake drums
and stop the vehicle.     

243
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,311
once the wheels and suspension system are in place,

244
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,915
workers install the axle assembly under the trailer.  

245
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,658
the average semi-trailer weighs
between five and seven tons  

246
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,763
and can haul up to five times its weight.   

247
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,807
narrator: the recorder is a type of flute
that's played vertically.   

248
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,877
it consists of a mouthpiece that works like a whistle,   

249
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,412
connected to a tube with finger holes.       

250
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,748
mass-produced plastic recorders

251
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,419
are a staple of elementary school music programs.     

252
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:58,690
real musicians, though, play finer wooden recorders.  

253
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,099
the recorder dates back to medieval europe,      

254
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,969
though it was likely modeled after flutes from asia.

255
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,772
back then, recorders were called flutes. 

256
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,507
and, by 1500,         

257
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,643
they were among the most popular
musical instruments.      

258
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,647
around 1750, though, the new transverse flute    

259
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,585
banished the recorder to musical oblivion.      

260
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,722
it took a 20th-century revival of music        

261
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,990
from the renaissance and baroque periods       

262
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,726
to bring the long-forgotten recorder  

263
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,128
some noteworthy attention.   

264
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,414
a recorder is composed of three hollow sections    

265
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,484
made of a lightweight hardwood,
such as boxwood.        

266
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,820
crafting one section at a time,

267
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:07,091
they find a portion free of  
cracks, knots, and other faults,

268
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:12,229
then cut away the surrounding wood using a band saw.     

269
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,966
they measure the block's diameter      

270
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,167
to ensure it's large enough.  

271
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,370
then they carefully mark and drill through the midpoint 

272
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,973
in order to mount the block on a lathe.          

273
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,442
precision is critical.     

274
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,912
the block must be perfectly centered       

275
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,248
as they round it into a cylinder.        

276
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:40,124
next, they use a large drill to widen the inside hole,   

277
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,093
known as the bore.       

278
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:49,333
they enlarge it enough to insert
a tool called a reamer.    

279
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,403
then they ream the bore to the final diameter,     

280
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,406
which varies according to the size of the recorder.  

281
00:17:55,408 --> 00:18:00,278
the bore tapers slightly toward
the bottom of the instrument. 

282
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,882
the cylinder, now a tube, goes back on a lathe.     

283
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,618
the smooth pencil line means the bore is straight   

284
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,288
and the tube is centered.   

285
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,024
they trim the outside to reduce
it to the right diameter,   

286
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,828
checking the measurement with the help of calipers.   

287
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,132
then it's back onto a lathe for the final profiling.    

288
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,369
this is where the maker gets to flaunt his artistry,  

289
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,639
embellishing the tube with ornamentation       

290
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,708
typical of the baroque period. 

291
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,919
it takes about an hour and a half       

292
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,122
to cut and shape        
the recorder's three sections --

293
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,992
the head joint, the middle joint,       

294
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,694
and the foot joint.      

295
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,968
now they smooth the surface of each joint with fine sandpaper.

296
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,273
then it's back to the technical tasks.    

297
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,942
locking the middle and foot joints in a vise,   

298
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,677
they drill the finger holes -- 

299
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,478
seven holes down the front   

300
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,149
and one in the back for the thumb.         

301
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,217
for the recorder to play in tune,        

302
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,686
they must follow the precise measurements    

303
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,655
specified in the technical drawing.   

304
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:24,494
in the head joint, they cut  
a flat canal called the windway.

305
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,966
it directs the air that's blown into the instrument.   

306
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,235
next, they carve out a rectangular window      

307
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,772
with a sloped opening, called the labium.       

308
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,975
the labium is what regulates the recorder's tone --     

309
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,644
the sound quality --      

310
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,913
so its size and angle are critical.         

311
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,449
the air the musician blows into the mouthpiece   

312
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,952
travels down the windway    

313
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,388
and hits the sharp edge of the labium.         

314
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,523
this creates a whistle effect, 

315
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,458
thanks to a block of wood   

316
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,794
closing off the top of the instrument.   

317
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,396
they use cedar because it never rots,     

318
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,600
despite years of hot air and saliva blowing on it.   

319
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,473
they complete the head joint by beveling the top.      

320
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,876
this forms the mouthpiece.   

321
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:19,016
now they glue a thin layer of cork around all the joint ends.

322
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,587
this creates a snug fit    
when the instrument's assembled.

323
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,359
they test the recorder's tone and tuning,        

324
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,029
making adjustments to the workings if necessary. 

325
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:37,434
next, they stain the wood,   
then wax and buff it to a shine.

326
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,839
recorders have a 2-octave -- or 16-note -- range,      

327
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,108
and they come in about 15 different sizes.  

328
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,378
the longer and wider the instrument is,       

329
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,446
the lower its register.    

330
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,448
the shorter and thinner it is, 

331
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,185
the higher the sound it produces.
