solid tire.                     
this one has no metal framework,
so it can fit on a rim made for 

68
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,006
this one has no metal framework,
so it can fit on a rim made for 
an air-filled tire.             

69
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,275
so it can fit on a rim made for 
an air-filled tire.             
rubber strips are wound around  

70
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,676
an air-filled tire.             
rubber strips are wound around  
the metal hub that serves as a

00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,879
the metal hub that serves as a  
mold.                           
then a heavy press squeezes out 

73
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:39,018
mold.                           
then a heavy press squeezes out 
any air pockets.                

74
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,619
then a heavy press squeezes out 
any air pockets.                
these rubber strips contain     

75
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,020
any air pockets.                
these rubber strips contain     
recycled material which is

00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,822
these rubber strips contain     
recycled material which is      
stiffer than regular rubber.    

77
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,157
recycled material which is      
stiffer than regular rubber.    
this will help the tire hold its

78
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,692
stiffer than regular rubber.    
this will help the tire hold its
shape in the absence of a metal

now it's time for some tread.   
workers begin the process by    
spraying a release agent onto a 

83
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,811
workers begin the process by    
spraying a release agent onto a 
mold so it will be easier to    

84
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,847
spraying a release agent onto a 
mold so it will be easier to    
remove the tire later.

edge of the southern one.       

439
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,052
and it is fitted over the ridged
edge of the southern one.       
the two halves are precisely    

440
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,754
edge of the southern one.       
the two halves are precisely    
aligned, then tape is attached

aligned, then tape is attached  
over the seam.                  
this both disguises the seam and

443
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:35,900
over the seam.                  
this both disguises the seam and
marks the equator.

next, each globe is mounted on a
pedestal that's attached to a   

446
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,138
next, each globe is mounted on a
pedestal that's attached to a   
metal arc called a meridian.

from fragments of paper and     

451
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,450
glue, a whole new world's been  

452
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,951
created in just a couple of     

453
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,688
hours.                          

454
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,290
globes tell us where we are and 

455
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,725
help us figure out where we're  

456
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,726
going.                          

457
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,060
they come in many different     

458
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:03,661
languages.                      

459
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,296
and because they help us get our

460
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,730
bearings, you could say they    

461
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,733
make the world a better place.
