00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,758
narrator: today on "how it's made"...

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,961
ball bearings...

3
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,096
electrical wires...

4
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,764
lost wax casting...

5
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,034
and automated machines.

6
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,505
with all the high-tech hoopla these days,

7
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,108
the lowly ball bearing gets forgotten.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,244
but many machine parts need ball bearings to rotate.

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,247
they're in household appliances,
industrial machines,

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,118
and car engine parts such as alternators and fans.

11
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,523
this is what's called

12
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,326
a deep groove radial ball bearing.

13
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:05,063
it has steel balls that move inside tracks called raceways.

14
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,400
the raceways are carved into a set of heavy-duty steel rings.

15
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,472
the balls are made of the same type of steel.

16
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,741
they first prepare to shape the rings

17
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,210
to the right thickness.

18
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,980
they insert the inner ring into the outer ring.

19
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,283
the set then passes through a grinder

20
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,352
that alters the width to the correct thickness.

21
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:31,757
a gauge checks the width of each ring as it exits.

22
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,759
now they separate the inner and outer rings

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,695
in order to grind their outer circumference

24
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,464
on separate machines.

25
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,902
the outer ring enters the grinder,

26
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,703
which shapes its outer surface

27
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,373
to a precise roundness and diameter.

28
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,847
a water-based liquid keeps the ring from overheating,

29
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,116
which would cause warping.

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,518
the ring exits the grinder

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,321
through a gauge that checks the diameter.

32
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:10,729
next, the outer ring's raceway goes for grinding.

33
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,232
abrasive stone wheels with an oil coolant

34
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:17,402
shape the surface to precisely the correct roundness and size.

35
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:21,940
the inner ring and raceway go through a similar machine.

36
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,143
now the rings go for polishing.

37
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,412
an abrasive stone lubricated with oil

38
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:31,550
polishes the steel surface until you can see a reflection.

39
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,486
here's the before and after.

40
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,488
next stop -- washing.

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,157
they coat the rings with thick oil

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,959
and a fine stone grit.

43
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,830
they clean the raceways with kerosene.

44
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,564
elsewhere in the plant,

45
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,568
they classify the steel balls according to size.

46
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,570
these balls started out as steel wire.

47
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,640
a machine cut them into pieces

48
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,842
and a die punched them into rough balls.

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,212
those rough balls go into a grinder,

50
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,846
which removes the bumps.

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,649
then other machines round them out

52
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,450
and give them a mirror finish.

53
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,655
this entire process takes a few days.

54
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:13,258
the balls go through a furnace to harden.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,195
then they get a bath in cleaning solvent.

56
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,397
after several quality checks,

57
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,335
the finished balls go into hoppers.

58
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,939
the hoppers load onto the automatic assembly machine.

59
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,211
the ball feeder sends the balls
through tubes

60
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,614
to a ball pusher that feeds the correct quantity of balls

61
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,015
into the raceways

62
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,418
of the now-reassembled inner and outer rings.

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,622
a ball divider positions the balls evenly

64
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,290
around the raceways.

65
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,366
next comes the ball cage,

66
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,902
a metal cage that retains the balls in position

67
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,837
around the raceways.

68
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,773
the first machine installs half of the cage,

69
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,842
the half with rivet holes.

70
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,311
the next machine carefully positions

71
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,848
the other half of the cage, the half with rivets.

72
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,602
the machine test-spins the bearing,

73
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,005
then rivets the two halves of the ball cage together.

74
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,675
the bearing is now fully assembled.

75
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,284
now it goes into a solvent bath,

76
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,821
then to a series of automated quality-control tests.

77
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,757
this noise-vibration tester

78
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,827
makes sure the ball bearing operates quietly.

79
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,997
some types of bearings are lubricated with grease.

80
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,034
a machine squirts grease evenly
into the bearings' raceways,

81
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,838
then inserts a rubber seal to contain the grease.

82
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,176
a final quality-control test --

83
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,178
an automated scale tosses out any bum bearings

84
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,047
that aren't the required weight.

85
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,116
the good ones move on to the laser,

86
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,785
which marks them with information

87
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,187
such as the part number and the trademark.

88
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,597
narrator: what is genetically modified food?

89
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,333
scientists manipulate the genes in crop seeds

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,734
to increase yield

91
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,603
or to make the crop more resistant

92
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,271
to disease or insects.

93
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,873
there's a worldwide debate

94
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,343
over whether this manipulation of nature poses a risk

95
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,046
to our health or to the environment.

96
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,288
we're so used to them that we barely notice

97
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,224
that electrical wires are all around us.

98
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,626
they're in aerial and underground cables

99
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,962
running along our streets and to our homes.

100
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,563
they're behind our walls

101
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,166
and inside our electrical appliances.

102
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,839
to make color-coded electrical wires,

103
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,708
they use what's called rod,

104
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,911
made of either solid copper or solid aluminum.

105
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,928
they feed the rod into a machine
that draws it out

106
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,599
through a series of lubricated pulleys and dies --

107
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,236
stretching, lengthening, and thinning it out...

108
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,989
...and eventually winding it onto a large bobbin.

109
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,828
what was once a rod 4/10 of an inch in diameter

110
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,431
is now just 8/100 of an inch,

111
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,300
the width of about a dozen human hairs.

112
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,904
they load the bobbin

113
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,440
onto what's called a stranding machine.

114
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,048
they cold-weld the end of one bobbin to another,

115
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,584
guaranteeing an uninterrupted flow

116
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,020
once they start up the machine.

117
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,196
at high speed,

118
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,599
the stranding machine twists seven wires together,

119
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,602
forming an electrical conductor,

120
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,238
also called a bear conductor.

121
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,343
this is a low-voltage conductor --

122
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,812
under 1,000 volts --

123
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,614
the kind you find in the cables

124
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,683
that run electricity to your home.

125
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,619
bear conductors need to be insulated

126
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,089
so the people handling them won't get an electric shock.

127
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,692
a plastic extrusion machine

128
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,896
coats the conductor with polyethylene or pvc.

129
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,032
this insulates the conductor.

130
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,103
this is what the polyethylene looks like in its raw form.

131
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,247
as the conductor exits the machine

132
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,982
with its new insulation,

133
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,719
a precision laser gauges the diameter

134
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,054
to make sure the insulation is uniform

135
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,590
and the right dimension.

136
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,660
the extrusion process has heated up the conductor,

137
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,596
so it has to be cooled down with water.

138
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,337
sometimes two or more conductors
are twisted together.

139
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,739
when that's the case,

140
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,941
a printing machine applies a white stripe

141
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,143
to identify which is which.

142
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,682
the client who's ordered the conductors

143
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,418
specifies the colors of insulation.

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,154
it chooses them based on how it wants to color-code

145
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,789
its electrical wiring.

146
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,969
several conductors are often grouped together

147
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,104
to form a cable.

148
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,373
the plant performs a voltage test,

149
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,042
immersing the cables in water

150
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,245
to make sure they don't short-circuit.

151
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,314
these medium-voltage cables can carry

152
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:46,851
from 1,000 to 46,000 volts of electricity.

153
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,854
they're the type used for underground power lines.

154
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:05,737
they're insulated the same way low-voltage cables are.

155
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,148
the plant prints the date of manufacture, the voltage,

156
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,219
and any other information the client has requested.

157
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,488
the cable goes onto a reel to be tested

158
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,958
before it's shipped out to its destination.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,492
in the middle of the cable,

160
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,629
surrounded by copper grounding wires

161
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,496
and a host of other components

162
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,833
is the heart of the electrical cable --

163
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,768
the bear conductor.

164
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,079
narrator: many machine parts are simply stamped or machined

165
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,314
out of solid metal,

166
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,384
but parts with complex shapes or thin walls

167
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,918
can't be made that way.

168
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,453
they have to be cast

169
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:59,491
using a technique called "lost wax process casting."

170
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,730
it takes anywhere from a week to a month

171
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,998
to manufacture a cast-metal part,

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,267
depending on its complexity.

173
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,271
the first step is to inject wax
into an aluminum die,

174
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,874
which is essentially a mold

175
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,809
whose cavity is in the shape of the part.

176
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,878
this creates a wax model

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,215
slightly larger than the finished part will be.

178
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,084
they'll use this wax model

179
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,086
to make a mold out of a ceramic material.

180
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,623
the mold has to be larger than the finished part

181
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,826
because metal shrinks as it cools.

182
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,829
once the wax model is ready,

183
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,365
they stamp on a code to tell the foundry workers

184
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,368
what type of metal to use when they cast the part.

185
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,438
next, using a hot iron,

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,640
they attach wax components

187
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,911
to create what's called a metal delivery system --

188
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,313
channels that will funnel the molten metal

189
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,048
into the mold's cavity.

190
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,402
next, they dip this wax assembly

191
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,472
into a ceramic solution called "slurry."

192
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,608
they do this by hand to prevent imperfections

193
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,477
that would cause defects in the casting.

194
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,079
to strengthen the slurry,

195
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,815
they coat it in a fine zirconium sand,

196
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,817
then let it dry.

197
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,156
a robot then keeps repeating the process with coarser sand

198
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,359
until the ceramic shell surrounding the wax assembly

199
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,761
is about 3/10 of an inch thick.

200
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,031
this takes five days.

201
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,567
now the ceramic-covered wax assembly

202
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,370
is ready for what they call the dewax.

203
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,106
workers place it in a hot-steam
chamber called an autoclave

204
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,976
for 5 to 10 minutes.

205
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,778
this melts the wax right out of the shell,

206
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,246
creating a ceramic mold

207
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,517
whose cavity is in the shape of the part.

208
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,452
once the mold has dried out,

209
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,656
workers can begin to cast the part.

210
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,459
first they put the cold mold into an oven

211
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,528
and heat it up for two to three hours.

212
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,497
this prevents the mold from cracking from shock

213
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,268
when it comes into contact with molten metal

214
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,604
that's close to 2,200 degrees fahrenheit.

215
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,008
they pour the metal into the mold's cavity,

216
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,012
then let it cool and harden at room temperature.

217
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:39,117
it takes two hours for aluminum,
four to five hours for steel.

218
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,821
once the metal has cooled and solidified,

219
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,892
they break off the ceramic mold
using a vibrating hammer.

220
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,195
this takes about five minutes.

221
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,203
they saw off the metal delivery system...

222
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:16,154
...then grind the surface smooth.

223
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,268
the final step is to make sure

224
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,804
the part came to the exact dimensions

225
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,674
specified in the technical drawing.

226
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,742
this is called "sizing."

227
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,146
steel parts have to be heated up
in an oven for sizing.

228
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:45,116
aluminum parts are sized cold.

229
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,155
technicians use a series of tools and presses

230
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,624
to measure the part.

231
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,626
if it doesn't meet specifications,

232
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:58,096
it's either reworked or simply discarded.

233
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:04,302
they use sophisticated equipment
such as this optical comparator

234
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,771
to check the angles and radiuses

235
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:11,276
and this coordinate measuring machine to verify dimensions.

236
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,987
lost wax process casting is used to make metal parts

237
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,322
for all types of machines and equipment,

238
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,993
everything from military weapons
to snowmobiles.

239
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,870
narrator: since the industrial revolution,

240
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,473
manufacturing has become increasingly automated.

241
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,543
it's about time "how it's made" paid tribute

242
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,212
to that marvelous feat of engineering,

243
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,148
the automated machine.

244
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,091
until the 1780s,

245
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:04,228
goods were made one by one in a home or workshop.

246
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,830
then came the industrial revolution,

247
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:11,903
the mass production of products
in huge factories.

248
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,039
industry's next revolution was automation,

249
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,977
made possible by computer technology.

250
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,912
by the 1970s,

251
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:24,848
two centuries after the start of the industrial revolution,

252
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,187
robots began replacing humans on the production lines.
