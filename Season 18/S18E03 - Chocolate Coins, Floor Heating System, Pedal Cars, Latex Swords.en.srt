chocolate under a broad blade.  

36
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:19,905
the blade levels it to a        
specific thickness and spreads  
it evenly, creating a long sheet

to spur that process, it travels
through a refrigeration tunnel  

42
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,149
to spur that process, it travels
through a refrigeration tunnel  
that is approximately 15 yards

00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,409
so as it punches out the        
chocolate blanks, they          
accumulate inside.              

57
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:08,186
the latticework of leftovers    
journeys forward to be re-melted
into the process...

so not a crumb of chocolate goes

59
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,857

so not a crumb of chocolate goes
to waste.                       

60
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:24,636
at the end of the line, dozens  
of coin blanks have stacked up  
in each magazine.               

61
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,739
of coin blanks have stacked up

and piles of leftover chocolate 

62
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,907
in each magazine.               
and piles of leftover chocolate 
have accumulated in a bin that

now it's time to print some     
chocolate money.                
to do this, they wrap the       

68
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,954
chocolate money.                
to do this, they wrap the       
chocolate first and then emboss 

69
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,722
to do this, they wrap the       
chocolate first and then emboss 
both the wrap and the chocolate 

70
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,091

00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,265
and swords appear, they couldn't
even hurt a fly because they're 
blades are made of latex.       

424
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,133
even hurt a fly because they're 
blades are made of latex.       
in the weapons workshop, they   

425
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,068
blades are made of latex.       
in the weapons workshop, they   
begin the sword-making process  

426
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,271
in the weapons workshop, they   
begin the sword-making process  
by constructing the blade.      

427
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,739
begin the sword-making process  
by constructing the blade.      
after tracing a template on a   

428
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,207
by constructing the blade.      
after tracing a template on a   
4/10-of-an-inch-thick piece of

flexible waterproof foam, they  

430
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,010
4/10-of-an-inch-thick piece of  
flexible waterproof foam, they  
cut out two blade halves with a 

431
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,146
flexible waterproof foam, they  
cut out two blade halves with a 
utility knife.                  

432
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,048
cut out two blade halves with a 
utility knife.                  
after slitting one of them down 

433
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,016
utility knife.                  
after slitting one of them down 
the middle, they glue in a rigid

434
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,886
after slitting one of them down 
the middle, they glue in a rigid
4/10-of-an-inch fiberglass core.

435
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:02,820
the middle, they glue in a rigid
4/10-of-an-inch fiberglass core.
this makes the sword blade stiff

436
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,623
4/10-of-an-inch fiberglass core.
this makes the sword blade stiff
enough for combat, yet flexible 

437
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,892
this makes the sword blade stiff
enough for combat, yet flexible 
enough to not break.            

438
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:08,693
enough for combat, yet flexible 
enough to not break.            
next, they glue a strip of      

439
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,761
enough to not break.            
next, they glue a strip of      
durable polyester fabric over   

440
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,429
next, they glue a strip of      
durable polyester fabric over   
the core.                       

441
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,930
durable polyester fabric over   
the core.                       
this acts as reinforcement,     

442
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,532
the core.                       
this acts as reinforcement,     
preventing the tip of the core  

443
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,335
this acts as reinforcement,     
preventing the tip of the core  
from poking through the foam.   

444
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,770
preventing the tip of the core  
from poking through the foam.   
now they glue the second blade  

445
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,104
from poking through the foam.   
now they glue the second blade  
half over the first one,        

446
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:23,708
now they glue the second blade  
half over the first one,        
sandwiching the core.           

447
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,309
half over the first one,        
sandwiching the core.           
the glue is a rubber-based      

448
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,811
sandwiching the core.           
the glue is a rubber-based      
adhesive that bonds with        

449
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,679
the glue is a rubber-based      
adhesive that bonds with        
pressure that they apply with a 

450
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:35,186
adhesive that bonds with        
pressure that they apply with a 
heavy marble rolling pin.       

451
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,088
pressure that they apply with a 
heavy marble rolling pin.       
next, using a band sander, they 

452
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,723
heavy marble rolling pin.       
next, using a band sander, they 
sculpt the blade's cutting      

453
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:44,129
next, using a band sander, they 
sculpt the blade's cutting      
edges.                          

454
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,597
sculpt the blade's cutting      
edges.                          
then they remove the foam       

455
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,835
edges.                          
then they remove the foam       
residue with a rotary tool.     

456
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,870
then they remove the foam       
residue with a rotary tool.     
next, they take a wood-burning  

457
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,106
residue with a rotary tool.     
next, they take a wood-burning  
iron and melt the foam in select

458
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,942
next, they take a wood-burning  
iron and melt the foam in select
spots to create the look of     

459
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:59,910
iron and melt the foam in select
spots to create the look of     
battle scars.                   

460
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,813
spots to create the look of     
battle scars.                   
then they spray on five to six  

461
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,381
battle scars.                   
then they spray on five to six  
coats of latex rubber.          

462
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,416
then they spray on five to six  
coats of latex rubber.          
this forms a protective shield  

463
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,518
coats of latex rubber.          
this forms a protective shield  
over the foam without hindering 

464
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,487
this forms a protective shield  
over the foam without hindering 
the blade's flexibility.        

465
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,489
over the foam without hindering 
the blade's flexibility.        
next, using an air brush, they  

466
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,558
the blade's flexibility.        
next, using an air brush, they  
apply two coats of acrylic-based
